1820001 the rumor is that moishas supermarket and glatt mart are quaking in their boots anticipating the opening of this behemoth
1820002 we dont object to anyone opening up a neighborhood store even if its a little bigger than the other stores their profit margins may be a little better than average because this is specialty kosher food for a wealthy community

1820053 you wont find the best image quality although if you dont look too closely youll be happy with prints up to 8 10 inches at lower isos and you can still get decent 5 7s as long as you dont go above iso 800
1820054 undoubtedly the stylus 1030sws weak spot is its photo quality on the positive side the camera took well exposed photos with pleasing saturated colors and it also keeps purple fringing at bay the bad news is that these photos have heavy noise reduction and substantial blurring around the edges of the frame no doubt due to the lens design
1820055 digital image stabilization favours a high iso and fast shutter speed to reduce blurring caused by camera shake or subject movement the use of high isos however do introduce noise and loss of image detail and so the 1030 sw gives its best when used in the bright outdoors
1820056 the olympus stylus 1030 sw definitely has the rugged qualities needed to fulfill its mission if you need a waterproof shockproof coldproof and crush proof camera it absolutely fits the bill and it even looks good doing it operationally the camera works well and operates quickly but could have better battery life and an easier user interface if you dont need the rugged features however then this camera is not a great choice image quality is less pleasing than just about any other available compact digital camera over 300 making it hard to justify the high cost if you dont need the ruggedness the 1030 sw offers
1820057 pictures taken with the test camera appeared very similar to test shots from other olympus digicams weve reviewed recently saturation was generally well controlled although reds were a little emphatic exposure metering was generally reliable in each of the modes supported autofocusing was reasonably fast and accurate in bright conditions but slowed down noticeably in dim lighting
1820058 the olympus stylus 1030 sw is a great camera for an active and adventurous person or someone looking for a waterproof model the combination of style durability performance and quality make this an excellent choice if you are in the market for a 10 megapixel compact camera of any type with a msrp of us 399 99 the 1030 sw offers an excellent value for the versatility and features provided
1820059 the stylus 1030 sw is one of if not the toughest camera on the market built strong enough to withstand some of the harshest conditions
1820060 now with more pixels a bigger brighter lcd and greater durability it features innovative technologies designed to make getting the best image easier than ever
1820061 ours is the most wasteful nation on earth we waste more energy than we import with about the same standard of living we use twice as much energy per person as do other countries like germany japan and sweden

1820081 a book about efforts to stop female circumcision in sudan
1820082 the tendency in western culture to map gender onto presocial sex
1820083 when we hear another language we hear another voice speaking that language
1820084 this opens our mind to the other persons culture and his life its all interconnected as we become curious about other languages we become curious about other people this leads to respect which then leads to respect for human rights

1820123 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1820124 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1820125 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1820126 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

1820253 prevailed over the government to hold talks with the agitating amarnath sangharsh samiti leaders in jammu
1820254 attempted at blunting the separatists edge that if left unchecked could wreak havoc in the country
1820255 the jammu stir will strike a chord in the rest of the country but we are also concerned about the growing consolidation of the separatists in the valley
1820256 this is not a bjp agitation this is a peoples agitation where even congress leaders have quit to be one with the sangharsh samiti you say that the valley has a psyche its time you understood that jammu too has a psyche
1820257 the shrine board alone should look after the yatris facilities

1820279 we have the opportunity to study these motor neurons and see whether they behave in a manner that they do in the culture dish
1820280 although the promise of these ideas are there there is much validation to do in terms of their potential to generate different types of neurons the scnt embryonic stem cell model is really our gold standard
1820281 it gets us closer to when we are able to use chemicals alone
1820282 studies suggest that things are going wrong in those individuals far far far before theyre ever outwardly sick

1820314 we are jammuites we have lived together for centuries bowing our heads in the same peerbaba dargahs as our hindu brethren i will live here and die here this is my birthplace and i will go to any length to support the aspirations of my people
1820315 we have inputs that many right wing activists have sneaked into the state to instigate communal violence here
1820316 though we feel assured that there will be no communal violence here we generally do not move out because of the high passions and violent protests
1820317 we want to make it clear that hindus in jammu have not targeted muslims but there have been some stray incidents in khour jourian and other areas in which gujjars have been thrashed and their kullas burnt these stray incidents are the work of some miscreants who have come from outside and want to communalise the agitation
1820318 i got calls from various places including kashmir asking about attacks on muslims i told them that all these are rumours and we are safe here
1820319 communalisation of the situation should be prevented at all cost as this would adversely impact on the secular fabric of the nation
1820320 the government agreed that all required and necessary facilities for the amarnath pilgrims would be provided the all party meeting suggested immediately initiating the process of dialogue that would facilitate the suspension of the agitation and its peaceful resolutions
1820321 neither physical possession of any land was given nor any transfer of land ever took place
1820322 there must be some communication gap which led to this agitation
1820323 these facilities are being provided to the pilgrims for the last 60 years and will continue to be provided by the government

1820328 t he eu has agreed to reserve 30mhz of spectrum around 5 9ghz for cars that want to talk to each other in the belief that doing so will save lives rather than add more driver distracting gadgets the idea is that cars driving along a road will be able to spot hazards such as a slippery surface and will decide presumably for the common good to inform those following to take care quite how the cars following will alert their fleshy drivers to the problem remains to be seen but thats not the eus problem
1820329 o n tuesday ibm was granted us patent no 7 407 089 for storing a preference for paper or plastic grocery bags on customer cards and displaying a picture of said preference after a card is scanned the invention big blue explains eliminates the unnecessary inconvenience for both the customer and the cashier that results when paper or plastic must be asked the patent claims also cover affixing a cute sticker of a paper or plastic bag to a customer card to indicate packaging preferences so does this pass the significant technical content test ibmers

1820354 regardless of todays verdict hamdans trial revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law
1820355 hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention only to face a process that falls far short so far the trial continues the bush administrations efforts to escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice
1820356 i welcome todays guilty verdict in the first trial held under the military commissions act mca this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward i supported that legislation which was a good faith effort by congress to meet the supreme courts direction to establish a process to bring terrorist detainees to trial salim ahmed hamdan a trusted confidante of osama bin laden was provided a full hearing of the charges against him and was represented by counsel who vigorously defended him the jury found that the prosecution lawyers had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that hamdan had aided terrorists by supplying weapons to al qaeda and taliban forces in afghanistan this process demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully unlike senator obama who voted against the mca and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
1820357 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully

1820447 hamdans trial violated two of the most fundamental criminal justice principles accepted by all civilized nations the prohibition on the use of coerced evidence and the prohibition on retroactive criminal laws the decision to keep these cases out of the ordinary criminal courts will produce years of appeals over novel legal issues raised by the untested military commissions system even after those appeals are finished the process will never be seen as legitimate by the world this case was the first trial run of the commissions system and the decision proves nothing except that the system itself should be scrapped terrorism related crimes should be tried in the time tested domestic criminal justice system a system whose rules have been designed over the centuries with one goal to seek out the truth

1820462 todays challenging economic environment suggests that the housing market is far from stabilizing
1820463 while we may be roughly half way through the eventual decline we are still in the early stages of realized defaults

1820468 i think virtually everyone including our critics would say that this would be an extremely ugly mortgage market if you didnt have the gses in it

1820470 as her mother the pain and anxiety i feel for her is indescribable and the feeling of helplessness overwhelming the accusations and media smearing although upsetting are very much secondary
1820471 i am appealing to you as a fellow human being to work with us if possible include us and to remember that we are madeleines parents and have needs
1820472 lack of communication and a void of information particularly as the parent of a missing child is torture
1820473 we need to know what happened with this this is exactly the sort of primary information that we need to know if it was followed up properly by the police
1820474 madeleine called herself madeleine and that was very much the name in the family as well so that makes us wonder if this was indeed madeleine

1820476 the lady concerned will be spoken to by the private investigators in due course and her information will be followed up
1820477 if it is madeleine then of course that focuses everything we are not saying it is we need to know we just dont know at this stage
1820478 dr bruce ivins was responsible for the death sickness and fear brought to our country by the 2001 anthrax mailing and it appears based on the evidence that he was acting alone
1820479 we believe that based on the evidence we had collected we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
1820480 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1820481 the spores used in the attacks were taken from that specific flask
1820482 no one received material from that flask without going through dr ivins
1820483 the investigation determined that dr ivinss role in the experiments were minimal and did not justify the time he spent
1820484 occasionally i get this tingling that goes down both arms

1820519 when you have something that works and sells as well as our monitor series it doesnt make a lot of sense to re invent it top to bottom
1820520 however if the r amp d team identifies something that can be improved even incrementally our philosophy is that such changes enhance the value of the product paradigms customers and dealers deserve the best value possible and thats what monitor series v 6 is all about

1820763 as we practice hospitality there comes a point where the suffering around us drives us to ask what it would take to reimagine the world weve all heard the saying give someone a fish and theyll eat for a day but teach them to fish and theyll eat for the rest of their life but our friend john perkins challenges us to go farther he says the problem is that nobody is asking who owns the pond as we consider economics some of us will give people fish others will teach people to fish but still others must be looking at who owns the pond and who polluted it for these are also essential questions for our survival we must storm the fence that has been built around the pond and make sure everyone can get to it for there are enough fish for all of us a homeless mother once told us that there is a big difference between managing poverty and ending poverty managing poverty is big business ending poverty is revolutionary too often the church has chaplained the corporate global economy caring for the victims of the systems as long as we uncritically manage the collateral damage of the market economy the world can continue to produce victims but as dietrich bonhoeffer said during his age of injustice we are not to simply bandage the wounds of victims beneath the wheels of injustice but we are to drive a spoke into the wheel itself its like in community when the toilet floods which happens when you have a dozen people sharing one toilet when it starts to pour out water you dont just start cleaning up the mess you also have to shut off the water that is causing the flood

1820809 i have spent all my life under a communist regime and i will tell you that a society without any objective legal scale is a terrible one indeed
1820810 but a society with no other scale but the legal one is not quite worthy of man either a society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities the letter of the law is too cold and formal to have a beneficial influence on society whenever the tissue of life is woven of legalistic relations there is an atmosphere of moral mediocrity paralyzing mans noblest impulses

1820861 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1820862 currently when you take photos the middle part of the picture is very clear but when you go to the edge it is not so clear
1820863 it really extends to all of the electronics that we use on humans you want to have a curved surface to fit the human body that is really the place it can be used
1820864 if you want to develop an eye to replace a human eye certainly you want the shape to look like a human eye

1820905 we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love
1820906 one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme
1820907 that was probably the most important step internally as well as externally to say thatwe screwed up
1820908 in their post event examination they identified that there was at least some problems with former leadership at mobileme
1820909 eddy has shown with itunes over the years that hes very good at running a 24 7 worldwide distribution point hes got some serious chops and the appointment is interesting
1820910 i think apple may have to consider broadly beta testing with services in thecloud like mobileme
1820911 for apple both strategically and tactically a lot of the sizzle would get shown in a beta
1820912 that would take a certain tool out of their kit their ability to maintain secrecy around a product launch
1820913 people say this is even better than all the rumors
1820914 they wont do this on hardware or the os but maybe on these internet related services they will

1820921 our national economy is continuing to pose enormous challenges for our working families
1820922 we cannot afford to wait for help from washington or for the situation to grow worse
1820923 we know this strategy will work because we have proven it before
1820924 when i took office in 2003 pennsylvania was trailing the nation in job growth and had spent most of the prior four years with a higher unemployment rate than the nations jobless number
1820925 with todays announcement we will have invested 740 million in new state funds in snyder and union counties since 2003 since january 2003 900 more people have found jobs
1820926 the bridges in this years accelerated repair program will require enough concrete to build 16 000 homes which would be equal to a 60 percent increase in new home construction
1820927 in addition that bridge work will demand enough steel to build four eiffel towers
1820928 we can lead the way out of the national economic crisis by continuing to invest in jobs and business expansion a safe infrastructure strong communities and the resulting gains in productivity

1820937 it turns out that the solid game mechanics and whimsical fantasy environment appeal even beyond the tween audience weve had a great response from testers that included everyone from grandmas who play with a grandchild sitting in their lap to twenty something traditional gamers
1820938 wizard101 is a great game for the whole family especially for kids i watch my 6 year old and my 14 year old laughing with each other instead of irritating one another as brothers tend to do i play right along side of my kids
1820939 having been a gamer for 30 years now playing with my kids has to be the most fun i have ever had they enjoy the ability to get many different spells and see all the amazing animations and both are always wanting to start new wizards to try the others i think the variety of schools and the spells that goes with them makes wizard101 stand out over other online games
1820940 this cant happen and therefore i dont need to prepare for it

1820945 fgf 23 helps regulate serum phosphate levels and we know that among patients with kidney failure elevated phosphate is associated with more rapid progression to renal failure and earlier death
1820946 the results of this study suggest that we need to be concerned about phosphate control even for patients whose serum phosphate levels are normal and that may involve routine screening for fgf 23
1820947 incorporating fgf 23 levels into the management of kidney failure may have its greatest potential for treatment of the millions of patients with early stage kidney disease who do not yet require dialysis who usually have normal phosphate levels but quite high fgf 23
1820948 routinely monitoring fgf 23 may help determine which patients need to begin therapies that control phosphate levels which may reduce mortality in this very high risk group
1820949 as the nations economy is slumping some fertility clinics say interest in donating has surged
1820950 we are seeing an increase in inquiries but were not sure if its due to the economy or increased awareness
1820951 i know thats why they call us for that financial remuneration she said
1820952 they dont like to openly admit that but some people are saying that
1820953 i think there is a spike more for financial reasons

1820957 it looks like moderate drinking has been increasing heavy drinking is down a little bit and total alcohol consumption is down a little bit
1820958 it is encouraging news that more people are drinking moderately and the average intake is coming down rather than shooting up
1820959 it generally tends to reflect trends within the country among middle class white americans
1820960 people drank about a third more back in the 50s and 60s than they did in the 70s up to 2004
1820961 at the same time theres been a decrease in beer and an increase in wine consumption among people but the average intake has decreased
1820962 the data are very clear that light to moderate drinking without binge drinking is generally good for health whereas a larger amount of binge drinking is bad it looks like in this population its going in the right direction
1820963 recent decades the messages about alcohol have increasingly emphasized the potential to derive both pleasure and health benefits from wine provided the dose is prudent the trends in this study suggest those messages are having an impact at least in framingham massachusetts among those not vulnerable to alcohol abuse intake patterns appear to be shifting in accord with expert recommendations

1820966 in moderately active individuals short durations of stretching seem to temporarily improve flexibility without the detrimental strength losses that have been previously reported
1820967 pre competition stretching became controversial due to what has been reported as decreases in performance however future research still needs to determine how these stretching exercises may impact athletes
1820968 durations of stretching at or less than eight minutes may not significantly alter lower leg strength
1820969 our findings in conjunction with previous studies suggest that for these muscles there may be a threshold of stretching between eight and 10 minutes that would be necessary to decrease muscle strength

1820993 the cancer they get tends to be more aggressive a higher grade and is more likely to spread or have spread at the time that they present to their urologist
1820994 a lot of veterans dont get their care through the va veterans administration
1820995 this message needs to go out to their physicians and their urologist in the private community to know that this is a large risk factor

1820997 im not saying that there is not possibly some relationship but i dont think that this paper necessarily proves it
1820998 but i think you could pick almost any exposure and increase screening and you are going to find more cases whether or not the agent is responsible for more cases or not
1820999 the finding is provocative but its hard to know how to interpret it unless it can be replicated in other studies

1821021 this can be one of the global centers for people to go to get their information and share ideas it is also a place where advertisers can reach people and better understand how they behave and what they want and thereby fine tune their approach within one of the worlds most flexible mediums

1821062 we also thank our customers for their continued patience as we complete these clean up efforts
1821063 we appreciate our customers patience the damage from the storm has been widespread and significant leaving many broken poles and smaller transformers that require tedious and time consuming effort to correct
1821064 also most remaining outages involve correcting equipment that carry a small number of customers this is unlike our early restoration efforts when we could concentrate on large device outages that allowed us to restore customers 1 000 at a time with the remaining individual outages we are restoring pockets of customers in groups of five to 25 at a time

1821081 new vehicle buyers are looking for the latest technologies in audio systems and the presence of features such as satellite radio and navigation systems will only increase as manufacturers try to meet consumer demand
1821082 for instance nearly 60 percent of consumers say they want a navigation system on their next vehicle and 66 percent of consumers want the ability to play mp3 files to meet or exceed consumer expectations manufacturers will need to focus on incorporating high tech features in multimedia systems while avoiding increases in problem levels
1821083 we have had some five years experience with relays and have been very pleased with these vans we believe that the latest relay model with the 160hp hdi engine has the load carrying capacity and power to cope with the demanding requirements of our external metering teams in addition we are very pleased that these new relays are fitted with trafficmaster smartnav satellite navigation which will further improve the efficiency of these vehicles

1821088 the fleet of vehicles we stood to inherit following substantial growth of our metering business within the south west had average co2 emissions of 174g km
1821089 the co2 emissions of our vans particularly in inner city areas like london are a key consideration for us hence the reason well be looking seriously at the brand new peugeot bipper van for 2009 it benefits both the environment and our expenditure
1821090 we are often tasked with meeting the demands of specific fleet requirements such as edf energys low co2 emissions policy
1821091 by offering edf energy the partner origin it will considerably reduce its transport co2 emissions while greatly lowering the company fuel bills with high fuel economy and low tax rates edf energys fleet managers can address the current escalating fuel costs by operating economic vehicles we have a very modern range of lcvs to help companies comply with environmental obligations while reducing their costs

1821093 what really impresses people about the glk are its striking design extensive safety features and hallmark mercedes benz driving comfort both on and off the road
1821094 this increase is due to a number of strong model performances in particular qashqai continues to be very strong and we are still unable to supply to demand despite significant production increases also our year on year sales increase for x trail is a great result in the current market situation improving performances of note tiida and micra have also made a significant contribution to nissans growth so far this year
1821095 it is a great joy to build a car and know exactly how much fun customers will have with it
1821096 nitrogen is a superior material for tire inflation because it diffuses through tire rubber about 40 percent more slowly than air helping the tire maintain proper pressure longer
1821097 if your tire is under inflated by just 20 percent you can lose up to three miles per gallon
1821098 those miles add up quickly and cost americans a great deal of wasted fuel and unnecessary expense

1821105 even if i did which i didnt he should never speak to people like that
1821106 he actually said i called him a faggot which i didnt
1821107 even if i was in the wrong even if i did say that his job is to deal with situations and to deal with people who are like that

1821111 sales of our expanding siqura ip product line grew and now represent more than a third of our total revenue
1821112 in the closing days of the quarter we finalized the reorganization of our international legal structure enabling us to fully pay down our outstanding line of credit on july 1 and extend the term of our bank loan this new flexible corporate structure will help streamline future growth while we recognized a nonrecurring tax gain in the amount of 116 thousand as expected we incurred significant restructuring and refinancing costs in the quarter
1821113 a local person but i would like not to talk about it anymore
1821114 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from former iraqi intelligence chief tahir jalil habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1821115 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book
1821116 i never received any instruction from then chief ne rob richer or any other officer in my chain of command instructing me to fabricate such a letter further i have no knowledge to the origins of the letter and as to how it circulated in iraq
1821117 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1821118 we want this question to go away so were going to call it ridiculous
1821119 in late september tenet returned from a meeting at the white house with instructions for cia
1821120 we are very happy to be able to participate in the efforts of an organization such as i c stars
1821121 giving interested young adults such as the i c stars participants an opportunity to gain credentials that will help them achieve their goals in the technology field helps everyone in the industry by providing fresh bright talent
1821122 having these two interns gain their certification through training camp is a fantastic opportunity for them to build on the skills they gain through i c stars
1821123 we give them business skills leadership skills and basic technology skills however for them to gain more in depth specialty training through an industry leader like training camp is a great way to really get these individuals on track with their careers
1821124 our niche is tapping into these individuals who may otherwise be out there doing something completely different but have real potential in technology
1821125 many of these young people are very community and leadership minded people and when they come to i c stars we give them an opportunity that they may otherwise not have had at the same time our program produces some very talented individuals the industry can then draw from its a win win situation

1821133 i have this unbelievably strong feeling that him sitting beside stacy had something to do with this
1821134 even if he was doing drugs it wouldnt make him do something like that theres no excuse
1821135 she said to me i dont know where he is he had to leave town it was an emergency

1821138 there is a significant possibility that braid would have been the next psychonauts or beyond good and evil critically acclaimed but nobody played it even at usd 10 if that happens at usd 10 then i am in debt and have to get a job and cant make games any more if that happens at usd 15 maybe i can still make games that is the difference
1821139 and again i dont know if i would have been able to convince microsoft to release the game at 800 points anyway so it seemed my best move was to make the agreement and keep a good relationship with them

1821162 the states enforcement action also accuses anderson crenshaw amp associates of threatening to garnish consumers wages or file liens against homesteads in violation of the texas debt collection act according to several complaints the defendants representatives harassed abused and threatened debtors during profanity laden repeated or continuous telephone calls
1821163 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guant namo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice the judgment against hamdan undoubtedly will be challenged in legitimate courts but there is no appeal from the judgment of future generations this system was devised to permit the prosecution of alleged wrongdoing by detainees while continuing to cover up the wrongdoing by government interrogators trials that are shrouded in secrecy and tainted by coercion are the very antithesis of american justice
1821164 in the strange world of guant namo justice even if hamdan had been acquitted on all charges he would have been detained indefinitely nowhere else in the u s justice system can someone be held for life regardless of whether he is convicted or acquitted of a crime todays outcome represents nothing more than an illusion of justice it is time to shut down these commissions and put an end to this shameful chapter in american history

1821168 we believe we have outperformed expectations to deliver over 30 growth in a tough end market environment while this tightening has reduced demand for our mobile handsets business our business driven by infrastructure investment such as telecom and most carrier related digital media has been solid and is still growing as expected in addition cogos growing international handset business has maintained unit shipment growth helping to offset domestic weakness however profit margins are pressured because the product mix favors low end handsets in q2
1821169 although the handset business seasonally picks up from july management still has concerns about end market growth in the second half of 2008
1821170 cogo has also strategically lowered pricing largely on mobile handsets and partially on a few digital media businesses such as gps and telecom with most digital media prices remaining intact
1821171 this strategy will ensure cogo is well positioned for growth next year even if the end market continues to slow down
1821172 management expects q3 to be a transitional period and that the handset business will be back on track from q4 and we will experience solid growth in 2009 our digital media and telecom businesses have not been affected by the domestic slowdown and continue to perform strongly management does not view the current weakness in china as a significant issue but an opportunity for cogo to consolidate and enhance its position in the industry to pave the way for long term growth
1821173 cogo has been able to create a pattern of sustainable and solid growth in the past five years because of our ability to identify growing industries expand our customer base and generate repeat revenue from each customer in q1 2008 cogo had 1 089 active customers and arpu average revenue per user was 55 thousand in q2 2008 our customer base increased 6 2 to 1 156 active customers generating arpu of 59 thousand up 6 8 quarter over quarter we believe providing long term robust growth is more valuable than having one or two high performing quarters and we are optimistic about maintaining our consistent growth pattern by strategically decreasing the weight of the mobile business while continuing to expand our customer base and increase arpu particularly in the new high growth industry management is committed to driving sustainable high growth and providing significant returns to our shareholders with our in depth knowledge of the industry and strategic market insights i am confident that management can implement sound strategies quickly that address any challenges we face

1821179 we had strong product sales in the second quarter driven by an increasing number of large deals including our initial statewide wins
1821180 sales during the quarter were particularly strong in the u s higher education market and once again we experienced increased demand for our managed hosting services
1821181 in light of the challenging economic environment we aggressively pursued operational improvement in our restaurants helping us increase profits during the quarter
1821182 while our decision to reduce hours affected comparable store sales the store level margin improvement outweighed the impact of lower sales essentially we carefully analyzed our restaurants to optimize their store hours based on profitability after 3 p m on a prospective basis we have optimized store hours further and believe this will additionally reduce comparable store sales by approximately 0 6 percent our focus has been and will continue to be aimed at controlling the economics inside the four walls of the restaurant in addition we have reduced our general and administrative expenses where possible to ensure strong income from operations

1821188 theres some blah blah theres some analysis but at the same time theyre not looking at their laws
1821189 most of them help the homeless but their actions in managing the occupation of public space leads to a worse situation for homeless people its almost always the case theres help support and repression often by the same people
1821190 you see ticketing for offenses most average citizens would never be ticketed for its a very self serving policy do anything to clean up the parks clean up the streets
1821191 in many situations its by laws written for homeless people
1821192 for many years it was the principle way police were managing the issue of the homeless in public spaces
1821193 the act of giving tickets helps us stop certain homeless people who are participating in certain behaviours that bother the population
1821194 we are conscious that criminalization is not the solution but ticketing is necessary to our work we need to intervene
1821195 our mandate is to harmonize the use of public space
1821196 theres police action political action and then theres citizen action
1821197 anything would be better then having these people end up in jail
1821198 often just as theyre getting somewhere this situation comes back to harm them
1821199 in many situations the tickets are given on a discriminatory basis so lets look at the way we act towards the homeless in the public space ticketing costs a fortune to society and it doesnt help anyone
1821200 its pointless a they dont have any money b when they have money theyre not going to use it to pay a ticket and the thing is theyll just find another place to sleep
1821201 the purpose of this essay contest is to reflect the unique characteristics and pride of our region allowing our young people to share their experience of living in metro detroit
1821202 these scholarships awarded by chrysler will provide lasting benefits and encourage these talented young people who are at varying stages of their careers to use their abilities to become leaders in the community and the hope for its future
1821203 my experience of city living can be characterized in broad strokes by driven individuals with shared values who often worked in union towards common goals humility community and perseverance these were detroits gifts to me they are invaluable and not to be idly left behind
1821204 just as the ambassador bridge connects the united states to canada detroit has provided me with my first connections to other cultures and ways of life
1821205 detroit is where i belong my roots may be from tennessee but detroit and its environs are where i have grown and blossomed into the young woman that i am today
1821206 detroit had been home both to the machine and to the spiritual it was in detroit that the fire belching machines of the great industrial plants like river rouge existed together with the equally fiery passions of rhythm and blues here visions of automobile bodies of steel in the clanging workshops of auto factories by day used to give way to soundscapes of soul music by night body and soul machine and spirit detroit was the place where opposites clashed and were transcended
1821207 this educational initiative showcases the talent and unique perspective of students in this region the future of our state and industry is in great hands
1821208 these scholarships provided by chrysler allow everyone to experience first hand through these student testimonials the impact this region has had on our youth
1821209 the increased acceptance of greener vehicles such as hybrid and electric vehicles is to be encouraged they have an important role in improving fuel economy and reducing emissions our advanced external sound synthesis technology increases pedestrian safety while retaining the cars environmental benefits we hope that legislators introduce minimum noise requirements for vehicles to encourage the adoption of technologies such as ours which will ultimately increase pedestrian safety
1821210 blind and partially sighted people use the noise of oncoming traffic as a cue for when it is safe to cross a road if a quiet hybrid electric vehicle is approaching then they will no longer have this cue and are immediately put at risk
1821211 as the leading voice on transport and mobility issues in the visual impairment sector guide dogs believes further research and development is needed to address the issues of identifying quiet vehicles for blind and partially sighted people the charity recognises the environmental benefits of these vehicles however more consideration needs to be given to the safety implications to visually impaired pedestrians
1821212 road safety professionals teach children that they can improve their safety by listening for traffic and the sound of an approaching vehicle is a warning that most pedestrians will use before making the decision to cross the road new electric engines make vehicles much quieter so we need to look at ways of ensuring the safety of pedestrians we welcome innovative solutions which address this

1821218 this ad tries to portray senator obama as some kind of messiah and mocks those who support him as cult like followers looking for a new savior
1821219 but then that wrinkly white haired guy used me in his campaign ad which i guess means im running for president so thanks for the endorsement white haired dude
1821220 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
1821221 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
1821222 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity
1821223 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives
1821224 we find that while no media ratings system can or will ever achieve perfection the best rating systems have three attributes they attempt to describe rather than prescribe what entertainment media should contain they are particularly suited to their particular media forms and they were created with little or no direct input from government
1821225 the third circuit itself has often told private employers to ban racist and sexist speech from the workplace effectively mandating the very speech codes in the private workplace that it forbids at public universities as i have explained elsewhere when a court or government agency tells a private employer to restrict employee speech to avoid liability that pressure implicates the first amendment even though a private employers voluntary restrictions on speech would not the equal employment opportunity commission has argued to the contrary but its position is simply inconsistent with existing case law
1821226 as a global warming policy the biofuels craze is clearly counter productive for example the clean air task force reports that in indonesia almost 12 million hectares of peat land have been drained cleared and burned much of it to make room for palm oil plantations in the process about 2 billion metric tons of co2 are released annually making indonesia the worlds third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases behind china and the united states

1821237 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
1821238 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
1821239 i applaud kym worthy and the wayne county prosecutors office for their diligence in prosecuting this case
1821240 the victim a young undercover atf agent was held at gun point and viciously attacked by leonard and two other accomplices this undercover agent valiantly fought for his life and fended off three attackers before being rescued by a joint response team of atf agents detroit police officers and a michigan state police trooper
1821241 these defendants are violent and dangerous they were armed and willing to attack an undercover atf agent to meet their objectives these lengthy prison sentences are needed to protect the community at large
1821242 the oil companies are looking for one two or even four more years of record profits and john mccain is promising more of the same
1821243 hes voted time and again against raising fuel efficiency standards hes voted against renewable fuels and green jobs hes made an exxon lobbyist his senate chief of staff and he has 33 oil industry lobbyists as campaign advisors and fundraises i guess big oil has gotten quite a return on their 2 million investment in john mccain
1821244 we can choose four years more of the same failed policies that have gotten us where we are four years more of oil companies calling the shots while hard working families are struggling thats what senator mccain is offering or we can choose a new clean energy future that gets us where we need to be we can make a different bet a bet on the ingenuity industry and determination of the american people thats what barack obama is offering
1821245 were going to have thousands of activists and hundreds of event across the country telling people in their own communities what the exxon mccain 08 campaign has in store for them
1821246 if you want more of the same skyrocketing higher energy costs and giveaways for big oil vote exxon mccain 08
1821247 i remember when i first got the script where joans roommate came to the office and shes just been fired
1821248 and i remember going wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
1821249 i dont think a woman at that time would be office manager and running the whole place if she wasnt driven
1821250 and joan could go out and find a husband quite easily shes an attractive smart successful woman but shes not pursuing that shes doing things that are safe to a certain degree because she cant marry a man whos already married
1821251 she wants it all and yet like many women shes like im a catch im doing all this and what are these guys giving us i think shes a little disillusioned
1821252 as she talked about it you could tell that the memories were coming up in her and that her body was tensing up
1821253 you could tell that watching the show for her was certainly bringing up a lot
1821254 its the initial reading that really takes you by surprise then you just settle in
1821255 i have women coming up to me and saying i love your character
1821256 thats another side of her and i respect that in joan she says and does things that i would never allow myself to do sometimes i think theyre nuts and sometimes i admire the actions she takes
1821257 she was playing she knew what they were doing on the other side of that mirror
1821258 she was taking the control back instead of being the victim she wasnt being slutty she was being confident and sexual that was one of my favorite scenes it was one of the best revealing moments for joan and i also just love the dynamic of men and women on either side of that glass i think it sums up a lot about mad men in particular what goes on in the office
1821259 wait a minute i dont know how to play this scene joan is being really nice
1821260 but she is nice thats her roommate and joan likes her
1821261 i think i understand now youre actually trying to be nice
1821262 every other girl came in here and listened to what i had to say youre not the first girl to be walked around the office and told what to do every other girl is doing that and been just fine
1821263 lets shake this off lets shake it off lets get a meal and pick up a man

1821269 im putting in my fair share im holding up my end of the bargain
1821270 how is it being on the show when they treat you like that
1821271 i cant believe someone would say that i cant believe someone would behave that way
1821272 i was a secretary at that time and this is spot on this is how it was
1821273 the doctors were really like that they would treat you like a child and talk to your husband
1821274 youve got to go in there and be like this and be like that
1821275 first of all i know how to act and you know what a woman cant act like you do if i went in with all this comedy and all this pomp they would think i was a expletive i would look like a crazy confident expletive you go in and youre charming and funny and dynamic and quirky
1821276 if i went in there and did that it would be too much i would be too much
1821277 wow when i first met your girlfriend i didnt like her at all but i just love her now
1821278 i just you know i like women who are a little bit more demure

1821286 it may be that speaker pelosi believes that going on a book tour and selling her book is a better idea than solving americas energy problem

1821365 king spokesman chris bence said the west coast is a good fit for elliott outside the state is the best place for him bence said
1821366 mr king is an ambitious man who appears ruthless and vindictive
1821367 that makes mr king a dangerous man who unfortunately wields extraordinary power over peoples lives
1821368 would all this be a factor in kings unusual demeanor on stage behind mccain
1821369 people on both sides of the aisle noted how king rarely smiled while he continually scanned the crowd like he was looking for someone or something i would not have mentioned it here except that others also particularly noticed it and said how odd it was
1821370 first he comes right in and parks right up front in the spot marked off for the governor the man always wants front row parking he wont walk anywhere its like hes the president and hes wearing his flak jacket he acted like there was a sniper on every roof
1821371 when it comes to political grandstanding alabama attorney general troy king is usually right up there with the best or worst of them depending on your point of view
1821372 even king may have outdone himself with his latest effort an attack on the shelby county district attorney robby owens for his handling of a death penalty case
1821373 his time in office has been marked by ethical and judgment lapses as well as a continual disinterest in taking the high road
1821374 alabamians are waking up to the realization that their attorney general has been playing political games with prosecution for some time
1821375 played a very curious role in installing his former client congressman bob riley as governor in the face of mounting evidence of election fraud in baldwin county
1821376 king said looks like tysons throwing his hat in the ring now
1821377 it seems just a little odd that king would pro actively foward a case to a district attorney so that he can charge one of his special prosecutors
1821378 its also pretty telling that king gave the case to david barber who is one of only a handful of republican district attornies in alabama when the alleged perjury occurred in bessemer which has its own da who happens to be democrat
1821379 it was a huge error in ethical judgment for the attorney general to seek a favor from the subject of a criminal probe
1821380 he didnt ask for just any favor he asked johnson to hire someone when such widespread hiring of friends and relatives by officials in the two year college system could turn out to be a part of the investigation
1821381 no different than a campaign contribution which politicians get all the time
1821382 someone needs to have a long heart to heart talk about high ethics with attorney general troy king
1821383 he either fails to grasp the concept or scoffs at it either failing is especially critical for a man in his position
1821384 attorney general troy king can be criticized for many things but nobodys ever called him a death penalty sissy
1821385 indeed king is so gung ho about putting people to death that its more than a little scary his viewpoint on executions seems to be the more the merrier
1821386 to people like troy king courts are nothing but an annoyance
1821387 all they do is protect the rights of criminals troy king despises the bill of rights because in his mind there are only two kinds of people good people and criminals like it or not people lie make mistakes and do stupid things that includes cops prosecutors eyewitnesses experts and attorneys general people are people even when they are state officials or crime victims because people are people we limit their power to take away another persons freedom
1821388 crime is serious but so is executing someone the balance struck between penalizing crime and protecting freedom is what troy king derisively calls the rights of criminals no they are not they are your rights and my rights
1821389 attorney general troy king maintains alabamas capital punishment system is as good as any in the world
1821390 yet considering its built in flaws kings assurances cannot be sustained with even a modest degree of confidence clearly the best hope for somebody charged with a death penalty offense is a vigorous thorough defense at the initial trial in circuit court but the system in alabama works hard against that obvious and basic premise
1821391 the existence of the gay lesbian alliance on this campus is an affront to the state of alabama its citizenry this diversity and its students one has but to look at the forces which the controversy has united from the american civil liberties union to the national organization of women to the queer nation just to name a few to clearly see how corrupt a cause this truly is
1821392 break down your money how to get beyond the noise to profit in the markets
1821393 the rate of infection is still high but concern among corporations is low
1821394 many corporations seem to think its ok to be infected several times a month
1821395 the great thing about this system is that from one computer it is possible to push out updates to all machines in a corporate network at once
1821396 it online learning seems to have a lot more pluses than minuses
1821397 they really enjoyed his messages about accountability hard work discipline and going the extra mile to help kids succeed he seemed genuinely interested in our efforts to reinvent public education using powerful online communication tools to reach students statewide
1821398 when you spend time with people it gives you a license to be a demanding coach or a demanding teacher
1821399 the only way to get through to students is to spend time with them
1821400 were all trying to take kids to a level they dont even know they want to get to
1821401 we will immediately begin constructing the facilities for unloading hazardous waste and for disposal of radioactive byproduct material since licenses and contracts for those operations have already been secured we will not begin constructing the separate llrw disposal landfill until the tceq issues a license which is expected to occur in the near future
1821402 the construction of the byproduct landfill is a significant step because its design and operation will be very similar to the landfill that will be permitted under the pending llrw disposal license both landfills will be on the 1 300 acres that have already been permitted by tceq the landfills will have similar designs with disposal in the sites almost impenetrable red bed claystones wcs has more than ten years experience disposing of hazardous and toxic waste at its site and urs has been significantly involved in the licensing of our facilities and is very familiar with our site
1821403 wcs has worked closely with the tceq on all matters relating to the design construction and operations of the facilities to ensure that waste is permanently disposed in a manner that is environmentally responsible and safe for our workers and the public the pending issuance of the llrw disposal license for class a b and c low level radioactive waste will give wcs the broadest range of capabilities of any commercial enterprise in the u s for the storage treatment and disposal of hazardous toxic low level and mixed low level radioactive waste and radioactive byproduct material wcs unique ability to provide a one stop solution will result in significant cost and efficiency advantages to the generators of waste
1821404 this major construction project at wcs site in andrews county texas underscores valhis continuing commitment to the development and success of this business enterprise wcs facility will provide a location to safely and economically dispose of waste generated by many critical service providers in our society including hospitals research universities and power plants we are proud that our working relationship with the citizens of andrews and lea counties can provide a comprehensive solution to an important need in the u s and create a significant business and employment opportunity for the citizens of west texas and eastern new mexico

1821406 john mccain is a strong supporter of nasa and the space program he is proud to have sponsored legislation authorizing funding consistent with the presidents vision for the space program which includes a return of astronauts to the moon in preparation for a manned mission to mars he believes support for a continued us presence in space is of major importance to americas future innovation and security he has also been a staunch advocate for ensuring that nasa funding is accompanied by proper management and oversight to ensure that the taxpayers receive the maximum return on their investment john mccain believes curiosity and a drive to explore have always been quintessential american traits this has been most evident in the space program for which he will continue his strong support
1821407 a thorough evaluation of a combination of manned and unmanned missions what kind of exploration would be the most appropriate
1821408 words matter barack obama said he would pay for his early education program by delaying the nasa constellation program
1821409 the early education plan will be paid for by delaying the nasa constellation program for five years using purchase cards and the negotiating power of the government to reduce costs of standardized procurement auctioning surplus federal property and reducing the erroneous payments identified by the government accountability office and closing the ceo pay deductibility loophole the rest of the plan will be funded using a small portion of the savings associated with fighting the war in iraq
1821410 to pay for his education program obama would eliminate tax deductibility of ceo pay by corporations and delay nasas program to return to the moon and then journey to mars
1821411 houston is home to the johnson space center obama has said he wants to postpone nasas constellation program for five years should that happen the gap between the end of the shuttle program and flight testing of a new spacecraft would exceed 10 years years with no u s ability to fly humans in space would obama really force such a gap deterring americans from pursuing careers in space science and crippling the u s space program for a generation
1821412 how would barack obamas positions affect houston and its residents
1821413 they were on a street in south peterborough when they came in contact with this red van

1821514 fifteen percent of fortune 500 companies are blogging according to a recent study from womma member company burson marsteller technology companies were the heaviest bloggers with the top four industries with blogs listed as computers office equipment network and other communications equipment semiconductors and other electrical components and internet services and retailing the study included only external blogs and indicated a reported 270 increase since fortune 500 blog tracking began in december 2005 a full 32 of the fortune 50 have blogs while the number shrinks to only 2 of the fortune 451 to 500
1821515 its not surprising that the biggest companies are doing more blogging they have more resources for communications

1821529 dewey what do you want me to pray about for you
1821530 i just really had a deep concern in my heart that i wouldnt lose two children as a result of this because i knew what will was struggling with
1821531 thats what has kept us breathing kept us alive is that while we are grieving this process there is a hope that we have that were anchored to in the midst of just what sometimes seems unbearable
1821532 if you do not do that within the necessary speed we will be back
1821533 my faith is definitely the most important aspect of my life
1821534 i was nowhere close to the perfect child i had my share of difficult times along with some disappointing choices that i made but thankfully god never stops loving me
1821535 do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus
1821536 that verse always encourages my heart when i am dealing with any kind of pressure and throughout the struggles of life my faith calms my heart
1821537 t here really has to be a purpose there i think thats what drives success
1821538 i know my talent is from god and thats my purpose to run to glorify him

1821540 however when im following christ closely theres a contentment and satisfaction in my life that is far greater and longer enduring than any good race ive ever run

1821544 in the second quarter we realized the benefits of our geographic and customer diversification efforts
1821545 despite the challenging north american operating environment which was exacerbated by the uaw strike of american axle in april and may we were still able to deliver solid earnings in the second quarter due to the strong performance of our overseas operations
1821546 given the drastic reduction in north american light vehicle production management across the company focused on cost reductions managing capital spending and reducing working capital the results of these efforts are demonstrated by our strong free cash flow figures for the second quarter
1821547 despite the headwinds of the north american light vehicle production environment we delivered strong results in the second quarter the cost savings initiatives and working capital discipline we implemented in the past six months will make the company much stronger when economic conditions provide for a better operating environment that being said there is still significant uncertainty regarding short term economic conditions and fuel prices and their impact on global light vehicle production given this uncertainty we are choosing not to update our previous full year 2008 guidance that we will be profitable for the full year
1821548 pure play music offers independent artists an immediate strategy for creating consumer awareness of their music thus monetizing their talent and efforts
1821549 retail chains throughout europe and the u k are delivering vast exposure for independent artists something that could never be achieved through myspace or other online opportunities
1821550 in store music continues to be a major differentiator for retailers to create a shopping experience
1821551 but in todays music world independent artists define what is new hip and trendy
1821552 at the same time we have quickly penetrated major retailers because they can differentiate their shopping experience with new fresh sounds while reducing their cost to license music by 80 percent by using new independent artists instead of mainstream acts we have found that retail airplay along with online movie commercial and video game placement services provides a huge revenue opportunity for artists who sign with pure play on a non exclusive basis to merchandise their music through alternative venues

1821672 the first newcomer to arrive was posted to our hut
1821673 right from the first his behaviour struck me as distinctly odd i often caught him pacing up and down our hut as if he had something on our mind for all his political moonshine jacob yakov had many likeable qualities and in time we may have become firm friends one evening however at the end of an unusually long brooding spell he suddenly rushed outside sprinted across the compound scrambled up the wall and attempted to crawl to the perimeter wire a shot rang out followed by a blinding flash and poor jacob hung there his body horribly burned and twisted we heard afterwards that the sentrys bullet had got him fractionally before he was electrocuted
1821674 our own inclination here is to recommend that the idea of communicating to marshal stalin should be dropped it would naturally be distasteful to draw attention to the anglo russian quarrels which preceded the death of his son
1821675 i saw jakov running about as if he were insane he just ran straight onto the wire there was a huge flash and all the searchlights suddenly went on i knew that was the end of him afterwards the germans tried to make me take him off the wire and wrap his body in a blanket it was the first time i felt sorry for the poor bastard

1821799 pakistans contribution in the global war on terrorism is much more than any other country our president has been attacked so has our prime minister and many of our leaders i think the stand that pakistan is pledging support to terrorism should be reviewed
1821800 the infrastructure outside the city is yet to come up to the mark why should i come to bengal
1821801 mumbai has one of the lowest connectivity charges because of a cable landing station in chennai it is much cheaper to employ quality engineers this is just the national scenario the incentives offered in many international markets are even more mind boggling

1821813 the evidence is undeniable even a 20 week foetus is likely to feel pain and excruciating pain
1821814 this is because pain transmission pathways have developed in the foetus but not the pain modulation pathways that are not effective until six weeks after birth
1821815 pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus
1821816 at 20 weeks the physical apparatus for pain signal transmission is in place
1821817 but pain has physical and emotional components specific regions of the brain that allow a sensation to be interpreted as something that hurts are not yet fully developed at 20 weeks
1821818 it is still unclear whether a foetus interprets a sensation as unpleasant

1821865 4 nee alleen het bijhouden van de zakelijke kms is voldoende ook dan valt er dus wel een verhouding vast te stellen denk aan de hand van de garagenotas dus niet blind varen op 75 als je op 10 1 bij de garage een reparatie laat uitvoeren en zij registreren 10 000 op de teller en op 20 12 een beurt met 20 000 op de teller dan heb je dus 10 000 km gereden als jouw zakelijke kms 5 000 zijn volgens jouw overzicht dan is dus weldegelijk aantoonbaar dat de verhouding zakelijk priv 50 50 is en dus maar 50 btw aftrek tip je hoeft als particulier de garagebonnen niet te bewaren zolang je de btw op die bonnen niet terugvraagt weeg dus af of het de moeite is om die btw op de garagebonnen af te trekken als de verhouding priv zakelijke kms daardoor ongunstig wordt t o v de 75 regeling

1821874 what do you think the alternative would be i mean you did something with your life you changed the world around you ive been here for a long time and nobody has done anything like that you left your mark changed the direction things were going

1821986 our 2008 second quarter results reflect the continuing effects of a softer economic environment our performance also reflects the absence of some significant government related contracts that we completed in the first half of last year while we are pleased to have kept our operating costs generally in line with production levels rising raw material prices for steel aluminum and petroleum related products have continued to put pressure on our cost base in order to offset these increases we took pricing actions in the second quarter which should help mitigate raw material price increases for the remainder of the year
1821987 demand from our customers continues to be impacted by high fuel costs and economic uncertainties and we expect market conditions in the u s to remain very soft for the second half of 2008 during the quarter we secured export and government orders at levels which we expect will allow us to maintain current production levels for the remainder of the year we have done a good job of cost management to date and will continue to focus on this throughout the remainder of the year through the steps that we have taken to improve our financial strength enhance our operating efficiency and invest in innovation we believe that we are well positioned for the eventual turnaround in our markets

1822011 we are pleased with our progress following the combination with altivity as results improved for the quarter despite unprecedented rising costs for fiber chemicals and energy
1822012 higher pricing continuous improvement cost reductions and synergy achievement combined to more than offset inflation and drive an improvement over the prior year period
1822013 the recent pullback in energy and energy related costs is certainly welcome but we also have a series of action plans in place to combat higher costs our first priority is to ensure that the marketplace shares the inflationary costs we are experiencing as a result we are pushing hard to see that our recently announced price increases for both cuk and crb are completely implemented including our new freight allowances with these customers in concert with our board price moves we continue to raise prices on our contracted folding carton products as negotiated price escalators reset
1822014 in addition to driving price increases we have expedited the timetable for achieving the previously announced 90 million in annualized synergies associated with the combination with altivity specifically by the end of the second quarter we had reached annualized synergies in excess of 15 million and now expect to reach our 90 million target by 2010
1822015 the impact of rising fuel costs and a weak economy began to affect commercial travel volumes in the second quarter leisure traffic was less affected as softer transaction volume was more than offset by longer length of rental enplanements declined sequentially throughout the quarter this combined with lower than expected time and mileage rates per day made the second quarter a challenging operating environment
1822016 however we maintained our revenue growth momentum adjusted our fleet levels appropriately during the quarter and continued to achieve solid results in our sales of used vehicles
1822017 more importantly we continued to make significant progress in our performance excellence process improvement initiative in ancillary revenue growth and in increasing our off airport presence in addition we have seen tighter industry wide fleet levels thus far in the third quarter combined with year over year pricing gains transaction volume however continues to reflect a slowdown in the travel environment
1822018 as a result we remain cautious in our outlook for the seasonally slower fourth quarter for commercial travel volumes and for the pricing environment and are aggressively responding to the expectation of a soft travel climate we are decreasing field and corporate staffing levels adjusting the size and composition of our fleet to better match anticipated demand reducing compensation costs and significantly curtailing discretionary spending in addition we are exploring additional opportunities among our revenue streams costs and business mix to improve profitability these steps will not only better position us to weather an anticipated weaker environment but should also add additional coverage under the financial ratios included in our credit facilities
1822019 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
1822020 during the second quarter we intensely focused on improving our new enterprise platform
1822021 these preparations culminated in the recent implementation of robust payment billing and fulfillment functionality as well as made it possible for the launch of two new b2b client programs and community features within the last week we are pleased with this progress although we expect that short term delays in b2b launches combined with the challenging macroeconomic conditions will defer the benefits and operating leverage from the new platform and previously expected growth of the b2b and meal delivery businesses to the 2009 diet season
1822022 despite the challenging economic conditions we are confident that recent enhancements to our overall business platform will enable us to achieve improvements in our operating performance in the third and fourth quarter compared to the second quarter based on the improvements we have made in our overall business platform during the second quarter we continue to believe in the long term opportunity for ediets integrated health and wellness platform and are committed to fine tuning the platform and digital subscribers meal delivery and e commerce businesses in order to best prepare for growth in the post holiday diet season

1822096 we might well start 2008 09 with largely the squad we had last season and after all they didnt do too badly
1822097 we have not brought in the kind of top quality player everyone seems to be expecting
1822098 we are still researching and looking but it is not easy and certainly we are not desperate because we have the right balance of youth and experience thanks to the work we did in the transfer market the previous year
1822099 in terms of numbers we have been boosted by the return from loan of several young players who have the potential to go all the way so i think we already have the men for the job

1822121 ashwell has shown in this series that hes a match winner and the fact that hes already in england with his family added to the attraction of signing him
1822122 hes in form and its always good to sign a player who is playing with confidence hell join us at a vital stage of the season and add quality to our middle order
1822123 hes an excellent fielder and he isnt involved in south africas one day international fixtures so he fits the bill for perfectly
1822124 nottinghamshire are in contention for silverware and im confident that i can add some experience to the team at an important stage of the season
1822125 i know that i am joining a competitive team and i have kept my eye on the results ever since the interest was expressed

1822129 we are disappointed by the decision having spent more than two years working diligently on a project which would not only provide everton football club with a new home but also regenerate kirkby we had hoped to avoid a government call in
1822130 indeed it was only in june that knowsley borough councils planning committee voted by a majority of 20 1 to grant planning permission
1822131 we shall now engage in detailed discussions with our development partners kbc and tesco to assess what options are open to us
1822132 it is important to stress that this decision does not spell the end of the destination kirkby project but it will self evidently precipitate a period of reflection assessment and re evaluation
1822133 a ground move is certainly crucial to the economic future of everton i have said it a million times that i love goodison park but we have to move for economic and financial reasons
1822134 we have to get more income into the club to begin to compete with those clubs i have been talking about
1822135 that is the reason we have been contemplating it and the truth is we have had enormous support from knowsley council from tesco and we have not had that from liverpool council that is the bottom line of it
1822136 the economics of the premier league are becoming more and more demanding
1822137 it is important everton keeps pace with the spending powers of our peer group and our rivals in the league
1822138 to do that a new stadium is critical and the strongest option available to the club in terms of affordability and what it can do for us in a business sense is the one at kirkby
1822139 while goodison is a wonderful old stadium it does constrain the club financially
1822140 this is the single biggest opportunity which the club faces and i recognise it is a hugely emotive issue
1822141 if the best defense is a good offense then i am more than willing to offend my enemies

1822182 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for the attacks
1822183 based on all that investigation we stand here today firmly convinced that we have the person who committed those attacks and we are confident that had this gone to trial we would have proved him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt
1822184 a possible motive is his concern about the end of the vaccination program
1822185 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
1822186 believed to have submitted false samples of anthrax from his lab to the fbi for forensic analysis in order to mislead investigators
1822187 was the custodian of a large flask of highly purified anthrax spores that possess certain genetic mutations identical to the anthrax used in the attacks
1822188 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel

1822225 i can only trust the truth ive been part of a lot of conversations i dont feel thats the case
1822226 we are extremely pleased with our second quarter results our sequential production volume growth of 16 and continuing success on evaluating our acreage has produced extremely good results for the quarter in particular the production volume growth has come from our core cotton valley trend objectives prior to commencement of our horizontal haynesville shale development which is scheduled to commence this month we are extremely well positioned to continue to enhance the value of our acreage position with our bread and butter cotton valley travis peak and james lime plays along with the potential acceleration of production volumes from our haynesville shale acreage we and other companies continue to define the area prospective for the haynesville shale which has the potential of dramatically growing our companys production and reserve base
1822227 this strong improvement in pdcs estimated proved reserves are a result of our ongoing drilling programs successful 3d seismic work in our northeast colorado assets and additional opportunities identified in our appalachian assets
1822228 pdcs significant undeveloped reserves should continue to provide opportunity for production growth over the next several years

1822230 eu3 that have been negotiating with iran in search of a way out of the standoff are expected instead to take a measured approach to the crisis in hopes of keeping the talks alive as long as possible said the diplomats who insisted on anonymity on grounds the issue had yet to formally land in the security council
1822231 the europeans are expected to pursue a graduated approach one that tries to give iran an opportunity to stand back at each stage
1822232 i think there is a majority concerned that iranian behavior is not acceptable but on the other hand taking punitive measures is always a difficult thing
1822233 there are countries that would oppose any kind of sanctions and so it wont fly it will simply not fly
1822234 if you have one or two veto power countries saying no how can you expect anything to happen

1822237 just as i was walking in here i received word that the new iranian president said he was willing to get back to the table
1822238 if he did say that i think thats a positive sign that the iranians are getting a message that its not just the united states thats worried about their nuclear programs but the europeans are serious in calling the iranians to account and negotiating
1822239 well work with our friends on steps forward on ways to deal with the iranians if they so choose to ignore the demands of the world
1822240 were very deeply suspicious of their desires and call upon our friends in europe whats called the e u 3 germany france and great britain to lead the diplomatic effort to convince the iranians to give up their nuclear ambitions
1822241 if the iranians continue to balk well work with the e u 3
1822242 in other words theyre the lead negotiators on behalf of the free world and we will work with them in terms of what consequences there may be and certainly the united nations is a potential consequence

1822279 clearly these are not the best of times for u s u n relations
1822280 i think these are not uniquely damaging but part of a longer term strained relationship that is rooted in the structural tension between the superpower and the multilateral institution
1822281 those who thought that the end of the cold war and the standoff between two superpowers the united states and the then soviet union would enhance the role of the united nations were seriously mistaken the single superpower may be even more negative
1822282 further darkens the cloud over boltons credibility at the united nations
1822283 if theres a positive side to president bushs appointment of john bolton as ambassador to the united nations yesterday its that as long as mr bolton is in new york he will not be wreaking diplomatic havoc anywhere else
1822284 he is now officially the permanent representative of the united states to the united nations and i think we will refrain from doing colour commentary on mr boltons activities now that he works here
1822285 no one with such views has ever been named to this post before it is like posting a militant atheist as ambassador to the vatican there is certainly some very negative symbolism involved but will his presence change things dramatically that is not clear
1822286 and we have to remember that he evidently wants to stay involved in the washington battles and so he may not even be in new york as much as his predecessors it remains to be seen whether something new and uniquely dangerous will happen
1822287 but still the bush administration could use this rumour as an pretext to deny him a visa to enter the united states for the upcoming summit thereby triggering another political confrontation with the united nations
1822288 thanks to the blood of the martyrs a new islamic revolution has arisen and the islamic revolution of 1384 the current iranian year will if allah wills cut off the roots of injustice in the world the wave of the islamic revolution will soon reach the entire world

1822295 we are not waging a war on terror in this country were waging a war of terror the biggest terrorist in the world is george w bush
1822296 we are waging a nuclear war in iraq right now that country is contaminated it will be contaminated for practically eternity now
1822297 if george bush believes his rhetoric and his bullshit that this is a war for freedom and democracy that he is spreading freedom and democracy does he think every person he kills makes iraq more free
1822298 the whole world is damaged our humanity is damaged if he thinks that its so important for iraq to have a u s imposed sense of freedom and democracy then he needs to sign up his two little party animal girls they need to go to this war
1822299 we want our country back and if we have to impeach everybody from george bush down to the person who picks up dog shit in washington we will impeach all those people

1822303 points delivered another record quarter with the highest revenues in company history our second consecutive quarter of profitability and our strongest business metrics to date we believe that these results demonstrate the increasing value of points services to our loyalty partners and consumers particularly given the slowdown in the travel sector and the fact that our second quarter has historically been weaker than the first quarter
1822304 during the second quarter we experienced very strong performance within our installed base of loyalty partners as 3 2 billion points miles were transacted across our platform up sharply from the prior year we expanded our relationship with american express membership rewards with the launch of the bonus points programs additionally we are excited to have recently completed a three year extension of our broad relationship with american airlines we continue to focus efforts on extending our principal based partnerships and have recently signed an agreement strengthening our longstanding partnership with alaska airlines looking ahead we are optimistic that there are a number of opportunities on the horizon with both new and existing partners which will continue to drive growth in the second half of 2008
1822305 we also made strong progress on the consumer side of our business during the second quarter by adding new functionality to our consumer portal at we are very pleased with the progress of our global points exchange gpx platform the first peer to peer trading platform between loyalty programs and in the second quarter we made gpx more accessible to users with the expansion of a number of features and tools these changes in conjunction with a comprehensive refresh of the points com website continue to make it easier for our growing base of over 2 million users to track manage and trade among various loyalty program currencies we have begun the initial phases of our communication efforts and are seeing increased traffic to the website as we implement our partner and pr plans for the second half of the year
1822306 our record first half 2008 results combined with excellent performance from our installed partners and increased clarity on our new business outlook gives us confidence in our 2008 guidance calling for revenues in the range of 65 million to 75 million and meaningful ebitda growth over 2007 levels
1822307 our current partners are driving record traffic across our industry leading platform and this momentum along with a solid new business pipeline and the expansion and marketing of our gpx points swap program in the second half of 2008 should result in continued strong top and bottom line growth for points

1822332 we have an experienced management team and strong balance sheet including 25 6 million of cash and no debt to take advantage of attractive long term growth opportunities

1822371 gives us a fair picture of what has happened to the cost of living over the past month or year but its near useless for telling us where inflation is headed in the future

1822378 im tired of everyone else harping on 4 a gallon for gas
1822379 weve been paying that for four years when everybody else was paying 2 a gallon
1822380 we are taking care of the challenges we have in alaska on our own
1822381 if we had to go to the store and buy everything wed probably be on food stamps by now if we didnt have our land and sea animals
1822382 more and more our take home pay is going to be spent to buying gas to go get caribou to go get fish to go to our camps and gather our food
1822383 normally i run into six or more boats on the water this time
1822384 where i went on the kobuk i was the only one there im still wondering how many of us will be able to go hunting moose and caribou this year

1822394 we were there scratching our heads looking into the trenches thinking this could be it
1822395 so we did some more research and then we found the angled walls
1822396 its in the right place its at the right angle to be a polygonal shape
1822397 the first thing i want to know about it is what the foundations can tell us about the architecture
1822398 how big was it how does it compare with the rose how does it compare with the globe how similar are they

1822402 vance do you realistically think this nut case can harm your personal or professional reputation
1822403 that i couldnt show damages because no one would reasonably rely on his statements in making a character judgment nor give his comments any weight in deciding to hire me as a photographer and they would probably say that nothing that goes on in asf reasonably impinges on my life now or in the future regarding statements made there
1822404 tell us all again about this lawyer in mass you have ready to sue me is there a reason why you wont name him her besides the reason there isnt any lawyer and its just you spewing another cowardly impotent threat just what is stopping u
1822405 we saw the whole sky flash with unbelievable brightness in spite of the very dark glasses we wore i believe that for a moment i thought the explosion might set fire to the atmosphere and thus finish the earth even though i knew that this was not possible
1822406 when i see arcturus rising in the early evening i know its well and truly spring
1822407 the stars are such unreliable indicators of the seasons they come and go with no mind to wind or weather arcturus could be in the evening sky and the snows still ablowing let me see the skunk cabbage in the swamp now that is surely the first sign of spring
1822408 ive seen skunk cabbages frozen in ice those foolish plants start pushing their speckled spears up through the frozen ground in the midst of winter a sign of spring fiddlesticks
1822409 speaking of fiddlesticks what about fiddlehead ferns as a sign of spring
1822410 much too late by the time fiddleheads uncoil their fronds in mid may we are psychologically into summer
1822411 every year the red winged blackbirds arrive in the trees along our river in late february their travel clocks seem imperturbable but this year they didnt appear til the middle of march
1822412 and mourning cloak butterflies i cant recall a year when we didnt see a mourning cloak or two in march on days when soaring temperatures roused them from hibernation sometimes even in february but this year we saw the first mourning cloak in mid april my goodness it was the same day we heard the spring peepers in the flooded meadow and bluebirds and tree swallows too showed up at the very same time
1822413 it has been a very strange spring indeed its like all the clocks in nature suddenly stopped keeping regular time peepers and bluebirds and mourning cloaks all in the same day like a jumble of badly running clocks all striking different hours at the same time oh my oh my
1822414 about things that have happened over there beyond the wild wood in the wide world about an ocean current named el nino about something called global warming so many experts with so many explanations of why we had such a crazy spring it makes my head spin i can hardly make heads or tails of it
1822415 the one truest sign of spring when you hear the call of the meadowlark you know that there will be no turning back toward winter
1822416 my goodness here it is the third week of april and only now do we hear the meadowlarks call perhaps theres something to that climate change stuff after all the calender has gone awry
1822417 the artist must reduce all of the subjective and objective with the end of informing human sensuality he tries to give human beings direct contact with eternal verities through reduction of those verities to the realm of sensuality which is the basic language for the human experience of things sensuality stands outside of both the objective and subjective it is the ultimate instrument to which we must first refer all our notions whether they be abstract the result of direct experience or of some circuitous reference to such experience sensuality is our index to reality
1822418 that the sensual is so closely interlaced with the entire mechanics of procreation is further evidence that man in his most profound biological functions is impelled by his sense of touch
1822419 no longer is his art earthbound sensual corporeal he had left behind all that spoke of the carnate the concrete he had reached the farther shore of art
1822420 i had always been interested in connections science is all about finding connections between things
1822421 the overwhelming and beautiful order which graces the living world
1822422 if we are to consider the implications of spontaneous order we must certainly do so in the context of natural selection since biology without it is unthinkable
1822423 a natural expression of the stunning self organization that abounds in very complex regulatory networks order vast and generative arises naturally
1822424 almost 140 years after darwins seminal book we do not understand the powers and limitations of natural selection we do not know what kinds of complex systems can be assembled by an evolutionary process and we do not even begin to understand how selection and self organization work together to create the splendor of a summer afternoon in an alpine meadow flooded with flowers insects worms soil other animals and humans making our worlds together

1822440 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time you know and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1822441 it shouldnt be bad news that people are doing less driving but thats what our funding depends on
1822442 our goals are at cross purposes we want more money for transportation but we dont want people to buy more gas

1822446 we just lost our brother we just lost a wonderful person because of them because of stupid violence

1822448 where are the parents what are they doing at 2 30 in the morning with a gun i dont get it i dont understand it and im so angry about it
1822449 my mom wanted him to stop doing it years ago but he just trusted the good in people
1822450 i couldnt believe it everybody up here couldnt believe it
1822451 ive been robbed four or five guys jumped me they came around the side of the house and jumped on my back and starting hitting me
1822452 we got phones and we call the people out the doors its just not worth it
1822453 we believe that conditions within fort walton beach medical center posed an immediate and serious threat to the health and safety of patients
1822454 and we need it functioning and compliant with all state and federal laws so it can function
1822455 the fact that you are a sheriff is not germane to the situation
1822456 within the city of cudahy 23 81 of the surveyed retailers with tobacco retail license allowed minors to have access to tobacco products after one of two surveys were performed earlier this month
1822457 the selling of a tobacco product to a minor is illegal and violates municipal law owners and employees of establishments who possess tobacco retail license are strongly advised to always ask for identification in order to verify that a customer is of legal age when requesting to purchase tobacco products this is the fifth year that the wisconsin wins wi wins campaign is being conducted retailers in surrounding municipalities and counties undergo the same inspection the wi wins project was launched in 2002 to assure compliance with federal synar regulation synar requires states to maintain a youth tobacco access rate of less than 20

1822459 but its going to be at a lower price point
1822460 i was just happy they would come to pick it up
1822461 because we deal primarily with the southeast and the caribbean we always like a tropical look
1822462 we were selling two tractor trailer loads a day just of mattress sets
1822463 for me it was a waterfront land bank play but i had to find a way to upgrade those rooms
1822464 i sat there for 14 hours by myself and watched all the furniture move
1822465 from my perspective it was a pretty good data set for what used furniture could go for i felt if we could buy below those levels we could have another business
1822466 even in an extremely tight market we were able to move it
1822467 because people were even more budget conscious in times like this
1822468 wed start at 6 p m and go to 4 oclock in the morning
1822469 it gave us the cash flow we needed to survive the hotel storm
1822470 one of the best ways we can introduce colorado voters to our campaign and our vision for this country is getting them involved in the convention
1822471 we are delighted that the dncc is allocating so many community credentials to our state it will allow colorado voters of all parties who want take a look and a listen to our message of hope the chance to do so in person
1822472 we have been looking for a while to purchase something in napa valley
1822473 its similar to bordeaux and we can give and take mutual knowledge and experience
1822474 we could not have asked for a finer team to carry on this legacy

1822481 will be compared to each other along with those of the mummy of king tutankhamun
1822482 we want to find out the truth and facts relevant to the history of these kings
1822483 it is doubtful that it could produce a scientific result to determine such important issues such as the lineage of pharaohs
1822484 for me to accept this limitation on the choices available to me as a voter there has to a pretty substantial benefit
1822485 vance do you realistically think this nut case can harm your personal or professional reputation
1822486 that i couldnt show damages because no one would reasonably rely on his statements in making a character judgment nor give his comments any weight in deciding to hire me as a photographer and they would probably say that nothing that goes on in asf reasonably impinges on my life now or in the future regarding statements made there
1822487 tell us all again about this lawyer in mass you have ready to sue me is there a reason why you wont name him her besides the reason there isnt any lawyer and its just you spewing another cowardly impotent threat just what is stopping u
1822488 deciding to remember and what to remember is how we decide who we are
1822489 but to say them oh to say them more intensely than the things themselves ever dreamed of being
1822490 still one would want more one would need more more than a world of white and snowy scents
1822491 and who doesnt want to live with the brisk motor of his heart singing like a schubert
1822492 the great appalachian mountains which run from york river back of these colonies to the bay of mexico show in many places near the highest parts of them strata of sea shells in some places the marks of them are in the solid rocks tis certainly the wreck of a world we live on
1822493 such changes in the superficial parts of the globe seemed to me unlikely to happen if the earth were solid to the centre i therefore imagined that the internal parts might be a fluid more dense and of greater specific gravity than any of the solids we are acquainted with which therefore might swim in or upon that fluid thus the surface of the globe would be a shell capable of being broken and disordered by the violent movements of the fluid on which it rested
1822494 in the places i go there are things that i see that i never could spell if i stopped with the z
1822495 the most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious it is the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science
1822496 if man had not encountered dragons and hippogriffs in dreams he might never have conceived of the atom
1822497 it is a universal condition of the enjoyable that the mind must believe in the existence of a discoverable law yet have a mystery to move in
1822498 science is a game in which we pretend that things are not wholly what they seem in order that we may make sense out of them in terms of mental processes peculiar to us as human beings science strives to understand by the construction of theories which are imaginative pictures of things as they might be and if they were they would lead logically to that which we find in actual experience
1822499 when i examine myself and my methods of thought i come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than any talent for abstract positive thinking
1822500 it is the time when the human brain can set to work on language on taste on poetry and music with centers at its disposal that may not be available later on in life if we did not have childhood and were able to somehow jump catlike from infancy to adulthood i doubt very much that we would turn out human

1822504 obamas advantage is largest on atmospheric issues he is seen as far more likeable and a greater force for change than mccain but on specific issues obama is treading water or sinking a bit
1822505 theyre standing on the corner and they cant speak english i cant even talk the way these people talk
1822506 less than four years ago obama was a state legislator
1822507 it tries to raise the question about whether obamas celebrity and oratory has transcended peoples ability to understand the substance
1822508 you have to have ideas that are relevant for these times
1822509 they would certainly be part of the people who are sams club republicans
1822510 theres an incredible amount of innovation even in just first person games thats really exciting
1822511 i think we were fairly innovative with halo 3 as well with features like the forge and the theater mode i think its proving to everyone who didnt realize that theres just a tremendous amount left to do in the first person space in the first person action space so many narrative ideas to explore game mechanic ideas to explore just things that havent been done before
1822512 i think its a great game and single player is obviously fantastic as well they did a hell of a job with their set pieces of scripting certain moments that they were really sure the player was going to actually see and experience first hand
1822513 the way that they use those moments to craft the player experience i think was very successful and something again where i think halo has a lot to learn from
1822514 while we certainly have many scenes throughout the halo series that are scripted in game moments a lot of time players dont experience it or they dont see the thing going on or they maybe dont experience it in quite the same way that we expected them to
1822515 its one of the things that we can always get better at and we pay a lot of attention to games like bioshock see how they do it because they do it very very well
1822516 halo has always been an extremely simulation drive game so part of the reason why it is difficult to script sequences is because the ai never cooperates or physics doesnt cooperate or we worry about the player pushing a crate into the way of this warthog thats going to mess up an interactive cut scene or something like that
1822517 call of duty 4 was an example of a game where scripting was very good and in some ways scripting was one of the centerpieces of that approach one of the things i know we should try to do is to really bring those sides together we want to have the deep simulation and we want to have also the fantastic presentation
1822518 the story development of call of duty 4 was really very good
1822519 i think it had a very memorable end very good sort of half scripted half interactive sequences that again we have a lot to learn from
1822520 poll what do you think of honigs latest marketing campaign
1822521 we might well start 2008 09 with largely the squad we had last season and after all they didnt do too badly
1822522 we have not brought in the kind of top quality player everyone seems to be expecting
1822523 she had access to all the legislative strategy for every major issue for years
1822524 i think regime change would be preferable because i think that would lead to greater stability in the region as a whole

1822529 halfway through our presentation it hit me were at a major microsoft keynote and were a completely open source company
1822530 were standing here we are side by side with the worlds largest maker of proprietary software showing how these two major industry forces can work together i cant remember the last time i saw that i have got to say it was very rewarding
1822531 a top priority is delivering interoperable solutions that enable our customers to harness the many resources and processes powering the enterprise
1822532 the interoperability between wso2s middleware and net builds upon the investments that microsoft has made with windows communication foundation and will further extend the reach of soas across legacy and emerging platforms providing a new level of web services enabled integration and collaboration for our customers
1822533 adopting list pr for national elections was a fateful decision
1822534 the remarks expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country a view that sees white racism as endemic and that elevates what is wrong with america above all that we know is right with america a view that sees the conflicts in the middle east as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like israel instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical islam
1822535 the profound mistake of reverend wrights sermons is not that he spoke about racism in our society its that he spoke as if our society was static as if no progress has been made as if this country a country that has made it possible for one of his own members to run for the highest office in the land and build a coalition of white and black latino and asian rich and poor young and old is still irrevocably bound to a tragic past but what we know what we have seen is that america can change that is true genius of this nation what we have already achieved gives us hope the audacity to hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow
1822536 conservative populism dismisses any inference that the rich and the non rich might have opposing interests as
1822537 the staunch ally of black america again hillary has attacked her opponent for lacking support of working hard working americans white americans
1822538 the path to a more perfect union requires all americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams
1822539 fine you think bush is an idiot but how much of that is because every portrayal of him in the media is to reaffirm the image newcasters have created of him
1822540 great you think obama is such a statesman etc well how much of that is because the media looks at him and says pretty much everything he does is statesman like
1822541 i dont know if the damage is all that severe maybe weve lost 10 percent but well know more later
1822542 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km 500 miles is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close flyby
1822543 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september
1822544 we were studying little graphene trampolines and by complete accident we made a graphene sheet over a hole then we started studying it and saw that it was trapping gas inside
1822545 its amazing that something only an atom thick can be an impenetrable barrier you can have gas on one side and vacuum or liquid on the other and with a wall only one atom thick nothing would go through it
1822546 you could have instruments on one side of the membrane in vacuum or air and on the other side you would have dna or proteins suspended in liquid
1822547 and then you could get right up close to image the molecules within a few angstroms
1822548 once you have a membrane that wont let anything past the most interesting thing is to then poke a hole in it then you can detect what leaks through that hole with high sensitivity or make sure only what you want leaks through that hole
1822549 we need to build a better base thats more impenetrable such as single crystal silicon im confident we can make a leakproof version
1822550 this military commission finds you on charge number one conspiracy not guilty of charge two material support for terrorism guilty
1822551 is material support a war crime the defense believes it is not
1822552 this verdict will complicate the administrations plans to prosecute dozens of detainees in guantanamo bay
1822553 i think you see even in a flawed system the administrations positions in the so called war on terror are too extreme even for american military officers
1822554 hes an al qaeda warrior he has wounded and the people he has worked with have wounded the world
1822555 the verdict was in long before the jury began to deliberate
1822556 this drought is worse than the violence how can we survive without water
1822557 it really is heart wrenching to see the iraqi people be driven to go through so much
1822558 theyve had multiple wars they have had this insurgency and terrorist action and now theyve got to contend with the drought
1822559 theyre used to the canal system of just pulling water off the tigris river or the euphrates river or out of the hamreen lake and they dont have that option this year
1822560 so our agriculture reps from usaid and the state department are trying to get them some new technologies were doing the same thing were working with texas a amp m university to get some experts in the field of how to grow crops with saving water
1822561 im afraid in iraq we dont have that culture yet
1822562 i dont hide it there is a lot of waste but we have started taking actions
1822563 now we have some serious consultations with turkey and syria
1822564 with iran im afraid our contacts and our cooperation has not reached the necessary level
1822565 there was also a very expensive and aggressive high definition tv crew shooting what appeared to be ad footage as the two worked the room
1822566 responses when asked about the vice presidency have only added to the speculation instead of resorting to the usual demurrals he has openly expressed his willingness to run
1822567 i think its great that theyre allowed to fly it
1822568 when we first started we didnt have much experience and patients tended to be suspicious if these medications would work so their adherence was not good and that resulted in higher rates of drug resistance
1822569 i havent made a decision about my vice president yet
1822570 whether this may apply to other similar kidney conditions and may translate into long term protection from renal function loss and the potentially life threatening complications remains to be established
1822571 its a wonderful concept that the passing of time will show who is right and who is wrong
1822572 its the perfect choice of a message for a government

1822586 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1822587 i also recognize that in the house and the senate there are republicans who have very clear ideas about what they want and at some point people are going to have to make some decisions do we want to keep on arguing or are we going to get some things done
1822588 while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution i am willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1822589 i am not interested in making the perfect the enemy of the good particularly since there is so much good in this compromise that would actually reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1822590 this addiction is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced from the gas prices that are wiping out your paychecks and straining businesses to the jobs that are disappearing from this state from the instability and terror bred in the middle east to the rising oceans and record drought and spreading famine that could engulf our planet
1822591 senator obama has looked at this issue and he realizes americans are suffering and he made the distinction that we do need to tap the strategic energy reserve
1822592 he said that she had offered him a ride home that they were friends and she had offered him a ride home and she didnt really know the way and so he was going to drive the vehicle

1822605 i know what happens to incinerator ash most of it ends up by the side of the road there are no engineered landfills in india fly ash and bottom ash is required to be managed very carefully in most countries but in india they simply do not have the infrastructure to do that
1822606 when waste pickers are denied access to the waste stream they go through the ash looking for metal the only substance to survive incineration intact
1822607 ive seen people thigh deep picking through incinerator ash for metals youre using the human body as a toxic absorber youre basically spoon feeding it to these people
1822608 they are effectively denying a livelihood to the poorest of the poor in setting up this incinerator

1822639 i want to lose weight and i want my kids to be healthy
1822640 there are so many factors and some of them are hard to change
1822641 our families have a lot of stress they live in dangerous neighborhoods with no place to walk their kids get no exercise in school they come here thinking everything in america must be good for them whether it is fast food or infant formula they dont realize the damage all this is doing
1822642 it all starts with our grandparents we are taught to fill our stomachs but not to eat the right food
1822643 latino families tend to think that a fat child is healthy and a thin one is not it is a big problem
1822644 when you spend all day vacuuming offices or cleaning bathrooms you think you are getting exercise but all you are doing is hurting your back
1822645 often both parents work late and it is so much easier to go to popeyes or buy frozen pizza for the kids
1822646 this is the first time i have ever exercised in my life i come here straight from work and my shoulder always hurts from vacuuming
1822647 in the first 10 years after immigrating people gain an average of 12 pounds
1822648 they arrive blind to american culture and with little knowledge about health care they work around the clock and neglect themselves they live a sedentary life and eat food that is too rich i tell them to go back to what they ate at home rice and lentils and fruits to recover what they have lost

1822658 its essential that the world know that xdr tb is not a death sentence
1822659 as or even more importantly our study shows that effective treatment does not require hospitalization or indefinite confinement of patients
1822660 our key leading indicators of lead generation student contracts and show rate continued to improve throughout this quarter building upon the positive momentum gained last quarter our investment to drive this growth during a quarter in which our student population is traditionally at its lowest adversely affected our financial results we remain committed to our strategic plan that has led to these improvements however it will take time to fully realize the positive impact to our business
1822661 our second quarter results reflect successful execution of the corporate strategies we identified last year to deal with a slowing market
1822662 lodging demand is linked to the overall economic environment which is complex multi faceted and difficult to predict today as such it is appropriate for our company to continue to take prudent and conservative steps to manage through this uncertain period
1822663 we are pleased to report these excellent second quarter results we generated a solid year over year improvement in our combined ratio and a strong return on equity we believe that our commitment to pricing discipline stringent risk selection intensive safety services personalized claims adjudication and effective expense management is the foundation upon which these financial results are built and we are not inclined to compromise our commitment

1822670 the economy and the credit equity markets are anything but a walk in the park these days but hey this isnt a game for amateurs and this cycle will most certainly show us who a understands the big picture b knows how to measure risk and c knows how to preserve capital why because the sun will come out tomorrow tomorrow may be a bit far off but its out there the goal now is to make it there with your capital intact and even with some gains along the way perma bears
1822671 folks are starting to figure out that traditional long only investing means that you have to be invested for a long time
1822672 i believe the correct posture is one of caution not to be confused with being bearish i believe that every bet one makes must be measured and have considerable thought behind it its truly okay to miss opportunities but the big cyclical moves even within secular bear markets must be had the same is true for cyclical bear moves within secular bull markets which i believe could be a result of a combination of both time and price i do believe one thing for sure the sun will definitely come out tomorrow i just have to be around with my capital and my investors capital to take advantage of the sunshine
1822673 i believe time in the market with proper asset allocation is preferable to
1822674 unless you are a professional market timer which if you think about it is an oxymoron you should be using stocks for their most logical purpose long term investing and your investment portfolio should be allocated in such a way that allows you to respond similarly when someone comments on the market news of the day

1822690 were taxing them out of the country unfortunately sen obamas plans would raise taxes on businesses even more hes promised tax increases on income tax increases on investment tax increases on small businesses thats exactly the wrong strategy raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you can do because it will kill even more jobs what we need are policies that create jobs
1822691 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1822692 i am pleased that we have met all of the first half milestones that we set out at the end of last year
1822693 we demonstrated our single stage sputter deposition process producing cigs films with greater than 14 percent conversion efficiency over large areas
1822694 during the first half of 2008 daystar designed built and began operations of its manufacturing prototype cigs coater big baby and we have begun process scale up by depositing cigs on 2x4 glass panels we secured a manufacturing facility for our first production line and we have placed orders for the equipment to build that line looking forward the company expects to have a scaled up cigs deposition process on big baby by the end of this quarter and we expect to begin the build out of the manufacturing line in september which is necessary for our production line to be up and running in our new facility in the first quarter of next year
1822695 despite a challenging economic environment we are pleased by our second quarter earnings which reflect our intense focus on tightly managing food and labor costs as well as general and administrative expenses revenues for the second quarter continued to be negatively impacted by high gas prices and the weak economy especially in the communities hit hard with subprime problems however we are optimistic about the introduction in july of our new menu that introduced several new products including grilled gourmet tacos our guests response to the grilled gourmet tacos has been very positive the higher ticket price of the new items combined with a price increase has improved comparable store sales trends early in the third quarter we believe we have made adjustments in our strategy to respond to the challenges of the weak economy and well positioned rubios for when the economy improves
1822696 mccains vice presidential pick will be crucial for his campaign and for the future of the gop
1822697 choosing someone like mike huckabee would indicate an abandonment of limited government free market principles however picking someone like eric cantor who has tried to help the republican party reclaim the mantel of fiscal conservatism could make the difference between victory and defeat for economic conservatives eric cantor would be a good choice
1822698 we are pleased with our second quarter performance which demonstrates the benefits of the strategic actions weve put in place to mitigate some of the softness in the retail environment
1822699 we achieved solid top line growth by strengthening our market position and diversifying our retail portfolio through increased shelf space our category management strategy and store within a store concept although our sell through has been strong thus far in 2008 we anticipate our large retail accounts will take a cautious approach to buying in advance of the holiday season given the continued challenges in retail we expect this will result in a concentration of holiday orders in the fourth quarter as opposed to the earlier third quarter holiday orders we saw in 2007 accordingly our third and fourth quarter results should be viewed together for purposes of period over period comparability and resemble our historical seasonality rather than the 2007 anomaly
1822700 we believe the leveragability of our business model positions us well for continued improvement in our operating results
1822701 after continuing to make significant investments in our business and completing the recent repurchase of over 5 of our outstanding shares which is in addition to our earlier repurchasing of approximately 10 of our outstanding shares our cash position remains strong with a balance of over 62 million at the end of the quarter
1822702 we continue to make significant progress particularly with sales production in both our funeral and cemetery operations in the face of difficult economic conditions we saw increases in both our comparable preneed funeral sales production and our comparable cemetery property sales production these results reflect our commitment to providing the appropriate sales infrastructure and the dedication of our hard working employees
1822703 with the exception of a few non recurring expense items during the quarter our financial performance was on target with company expectations additionally dcas clinical quality results continue to rank well above industry averages which is a critical component of both our short and long term goals our companys technical and financial infrastructure continues to build with the recent addition of a clinical reporting software system which will be deployed throughout the organization over the next couple of years finally i am pleased to announce that our new center in camp hill pennsylvania was certified by medicare earlier this week and is in the process of bringing new patients into our system we anticipate this center to be treating approximately 75 patients within its first full year of operation

1822713 weve got people coming in the next six months theyve got to decide between food gas and heat

1822717 sen smith is not someone who has been aggressive in challenging the bush administration
1822718 on the mailing list it explicitly said in 2006 erickson was endorsed by so and so
1822719 once again we were able to achieve our financial commitments and post outstanding results despite facing a challenging economic environment during our seasonally slowest quarter we were able to improve our operating margins generate strong cash flow deliver working capital improvements acquire a complementary business and pay down our debt i am particularly pleased with our strong cash flow generation which we accomplished by aggressively managing and improving our working capital for the first six months of 2008 we were able to generate 126 4 million of cash flows from continuing operations representing an 88 5 million or a 233 increase from the same period last year i am also very pleased that we were able to decrease our debt by approximately 14 million during the quarter that we acquired rex and paid our highest quarterly cash interest payments
1822720 our success during the quarter is attributable to having a clear and concise game plan that allows us to be agile and responsive to both our customers and our cost structure also since our arrival at cenveo in 2005 we have targeted niche product offerings that are less exposed to the current economic climate than the rest of the industry and have higher growth potential going forward we remain committed to our strategy to become the industrys premier printing company by providing our customers low cost and high value solutions from our diverse product offerings this plan is working and is resulting in improved margins and stronger cash flows which we will use to pay down debt and grow our business organically and through thoughtful strategic acquisition we are focused on continuing to execute our plan in the back half of the year and i am confident that we have an experienced and seasoned management team in place that clearly understands what is needed to be accomplished to achieve our full year financial commitments the cost actions which we implemented earlier this year coupled with the operating momentum which we saw in the second quarter gives me great optimism that cenveo is positioned to deliver both our short and long term goals and commitments
1822721 though we are very pleased with the increase in net sales over the third quarter and strong flow of new orders in our space amp defense group the group continued to have execution issues on several production and development programs which we are addressing
1822722 during the quarter george blanton joined our management team as chief financial officer georges extensive experience integrating acquisitions and driving improved financial performance is an excellent fit for anaren given our recent acquisition of m s kennedy corp and our focus on improving profitability and cash flow
1822723 all of our business lines experienced volume and revenue growth during the second quarter reflecting the solid fundamentals of our industry and execution by our team this success is further magnified by our ability to improve gross margins and gain modest pricing improvements despite relatively flat hospital admissions and an overall soft economic environment amns strategy to offer a diverse product line across a broad client base and our leadership position in the fastest growing most profitable segments of the healthcare staffing industry is proving its value to our shareholders
1822724 we expect all of our business segments to continue to drive both year over year and sequential quarterly revenue growth in the third quarter just as important we also expect gross margins to remain relatively stable and with continued improvements in operational efficiency we expect to grow earnings at a stronger pace than revenue

1822759 the fourth quarters financial results capped a strong fiscal year for parexel we posted record service revenue in the fourth quarter and achieved full year service revenue growth of 30 0 or approximately 19 on a same store constant currency adjusted basis all business segments contributed to the positive full year results we also delivered on our commitment to improve profitability increasing operating margin to 9 9 in the quarter and by 120 basis points to 9 for the full fiscal year while concurrently making strategic investments to help meet our longer term goals notable improvements in the perceptive informatics and medical communications businesses as well as significant leveraging of sg amp a as a result of very strong service revenue growth in crs were the primary contributors to solid operating margin expansion during the fiscal year

1822970 the u s governments process for investigating trafficking of household workers by foreign diplomats has in some instances been hampered by delays in coordination between state and justice on the use of investigative techniques
1822971 no doubt ill be a bit rusty because i havent played for a year
1822972 but im confident ive put all the hard work in so its just another game for me
1822973 it doesnt mean a thing its my first game of the season
1822974 im just going to go out there and play my normal game im not really thinking too much about it im just treating it like every game ive played
1822975 hes been probably our best player all year if i can go out there and play like lance ill be happy
1822976 i gave my all at west ham and enjoyed my time there but the decision is the best for the both of us now i will take my time to consider my football future
1822977 the decision to part company has been taken jointly and has no bearing on ljungbergs fitness which he proved at euro 2008
1822978 yesterday i was involved in a very lengthy arbitration regarding the vesley case and i didnt feel it was appropriate at that point in time to give credence to a rumor that i felt was inaccurate
1822979 in all honesty the sheriff is not investigating these crimes im investigating these crimes and my officers are
1822980 the sheriff does not at this point have all the information that we have at hand
1822981 the support of our council to be very aggressive about our gang enforcement
1822982 were working with the gang unit the jet team and our criminal investigation division is continuing their investigation
1822983 we have as many as 8 detectives working on this case and were working with the safe streets task force the drug enforcement administration task force and u s marshalls we probably have 32 officers on this task force working on these cases
1822984 i intend to have some more conversations with the police chief about how were going to do everything we can to deal with it and deal with it very aggressively we have a lot of officers assigned to it and were going to take care of business
1822985 just remember fans take losses much harder than the majority of players do
1822986 but were figuring out a way to shoot around it kind of write it in the story
1822987 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
1822988 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
1822989 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
1822990 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
1822991 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
1822992 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
1822993 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
1822994 if everything is so good for barack obama why isnt everything so good for barack obama
1822995 whats remarkable this summer is the stability of this race
1822996 in a broad sense it is similar to previous elections
1822997 the reign of charlemagne was greatly aided by a general improvement in the weather during the eight and ninth centuries
1822998 this grant is fundamental to the maine department of transportations efforts to modernize the existing ferry docking facility in rockland
1822999 rehabilitating the facility will ease the movement of ferries in the port of rockland and accommodate larger ships thereby increasing the ports capacity
1823000 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
1823001 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
1823002 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
1823003 right kind rooted in the real lives of real people

1823007 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1823008 that moment in victory lane i wanted to pause it and burn it into my memory forever because its such an awesome awesome feeling
1823009 i got really sick of hearing why arent you winning
1823010 but it made me look at the pit crew myself my driving style it made me look at a lot of things
1823011 this sport is like a roller coaster sometimes youre at the top and sometimes youre at the bottom
1823012 when youre down on the bottom you just have to keep working at it dont ever give up and keep trying to work your way back up to the top
1823013 sometimes you dont know how you get down to the bottom and sometimes you dont know how you get to the top theyre both the same thing its just the results are different
1823014 not so much that we havent won a race to me its more frustrating that we werent competitive to win a race theres a big difference between leading laps running good having issues and not pulling the win off than not even being close to the front or leading the laps to get the wins
1823015 its not like were not running well because we are
1823016 weve just had some circumstances that havent gone our way
1823017 at the beginning of the year we went eight races without winning and at that point i found it odd i was criticized for not winning in that period of time
1823018 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1823019 its definitely a place i feel like weve got the potential to win even before we make a single lap
1823020 when a j foyt was the first to win four indy 500s that was huge to imagine all the different types of racing thats been at watkins glen and know that weve got a shot to do something that hasnt been done before is definitely a cool opportunity
1823021 driving cars with suspension and definitely driving cars that you had to shift thats something that came relatively easy to me and still comes easy to me as far as knowing how to synchronize the gears without having to use the help of the clutch
1823022 theres just something about the shifting side of it thats been really natural to me and its fun i like having a different discipline to race on i like having the opportunity to do something twice a year that we dont get a shot at doing very often i take the same amount of pride that someone like ron fellows or scott pruett does when they come into a road course race i take that same pride in running well that they do in these cars i dont look at it from the standpoint that its a negative weekend i look at it as a positive that its something we enjoy and i feel like that gives us a leg up on most of the guys we race with at these tracks
1823023 you know that when you outrun jeff that you did an excellent job
1823024 youre not going to back into a win with jeff out there
1823025 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1823026 with every corner theres a different rhythm to it even on an oval but its repetitive
1823027 indy might be one of the hardest ovals because each corner is so different id put pocono maybe second most intense mentally
1823028 but when you get to a road course youve got to turn left turn right hard braking zones and intermediate braking zones downshifts and up shifts there is a lot of stuff going on over the course of a lap on a road course
1823029 the tracks that weve been at here recently are pretty unique and tracks that we wont see in the chase
1823030 so were telling ourselves weve still got a lot of work ahead weve still got a lot of testing planned for the season
1823031 of course you can no problem as long as your hook ups reach we dont care how you pull in
1823032 i would rather him spend his time on getting things right with the company not on that jihad
1823033 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
1823034 no obvious evidence of price fixing or collusion between the major participants in the industry
1823035 there was a lot of concern about why prices were rising so rapidly
1823036 we believe the market is pretty competitive at the moment
1823037 this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off

1823054 yo no veo realmente ning n problema de coordinaci n ah se requieren otras cosas pero hay que encararlo
1823055 i think what we really need to work on over the next four five months and it goes back to the speech that sen obama gave tuesday and this little fight that ive been watching and that is we need to make sure that we take politics out of service
1823056 and john mccains my long time friend if that is one area that i would ask him to calm down on its that dont be standing up and uttering your political views and implying that all the people in the military support them because they dont any more than when the democrats have political issues during the vietnam war lets get the politics out of the military take care of our military people or have our political arguments in other areas
1823057 and we should spend the rest of our lives thanking people for doing that
1823058 it doesnt have any connection at all in being a good senator as being a good president
1823059 i could have done so many things in life that probably could have been more productive in terms of being able to resolve legislative and other type of things
1823060 i think my training in law school better prepared me to be a lawmaker than getting shot in korea as i did in 1950 but i think that people who serve should be treated differently i think people put their lives in harms way
1823061 sadly sen mccain was not available during those times and i say that with all due respect to him
1823062 i think that the notion that the members of the senate who were in the ground forces or who were ashore in vietnam have a very different view of vietnam and the cost that you described than john mccain does because he was in isolation essentially for many of those years and did not experience the turmoil here or the challenges that were involved for those of us who served in vietnam during the vietnam war
1823063 to some extent his national security experience in that regard is sadly limited and i think it is reflected in some of the ways that he thinks about how u s forces might be committed to conflicts around the world
1823064 im the perfect disaster moving faster and faster you cant stop me im super girl im everywhere im flashing lights they stop and stare
1823065 i was a russian major with no experience teaching and got there and all of the sudden 60 kids were dumped in my lap
1823066 i was asked to be in charge of curriculum and recruiting volunteers
1823067 i think a lot of americans go abroad thinking just by virtue of the fact that you are american and have a college education that youll know theyll be some way for you to help out abroad but thats not necessarily true
1823068 i think a lot of development work takes highly trained professionals
1823069 how do you make it a two way street instead of following the same old one way west to the rest kind of model
1823070 we need other human beings and other cultures to supplement our knowledge
1823071 its almost a joke now in the ngo world and the service world that these students come and theyre trying to pad their resumes
1823072 once you have that recognition that one needs something from the outer world from other people from other cultures then and only then do you have the capacity to actually be of service to anyone else
1823073 a huge part of our mission and philosophy is to make sure that were only doing projects that the community has requested
1823074 its really important that we dont impose any of our ideals on them we just want to make sure were helping them in a way that they see they need help
1823075 i think volunteers will tell you that as great as the experience was and as much as we felt like we accomplished they always feel like they got more out of it then they were able to give
1823076 with all this focus on volunteering abroad it takes focus away from needs of communities in united states
1823077 what is it that makes the people in a small village in tonga more deserving than people in the ghettos in new orleans that have been left out
1823078 the goals of such programs need to be very very very clear the communities in which these volunteers are placed need to have an absolute first say they need to be part of how these things are designed they can have an absolute say in how this volunteer experience should be structured to benefit all people involved
1823079 in building these projects and creating these programs were not just there giving handouts were fully engaging communities in cameroon and were also engaging our communities in the united states
1823080 i think its probably pretty rare that you graduate from college and your first job provides you with real concrete positive results and feedback
1823081 its really focused on education its focused on local voices its focused on local participation and local leadership and i think thats really the best strategy you can take in a short term program
1823082 para fazer isso convidamos uma cole o de atletas de todas as atividades desportivas e de cada regi o ao redor do mundo para blogar sobre suas experi ncias durante os jogos ol mpicos
1823083 if i sat on his chest my baby would have died
1823084 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
1823085 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without potentially the greatest player who has ever lived certainly the greatest player of his era
1823086 as far as im concerned it really puts europe in an advantageous place it puts europe in a favourite role theres just no question about it
1823087 in the past when you looked at the teams on paper you could maybe say it would be close and it turned out the last two werent close at all but to argue that europe wouldnt be the favourite this time around would be very difficult
1823088 if europe beats us again then its time to say maybe they are beating us because they are just that much better they are great at team play and they seem to have some kind of chemistry that works really really well
1823089 i couldnt be happier it looks like there are at least six guys that are really secure to make this team
1823090 the four picks are going to be a little more difficult than i thought
1823091 if i just take the top eight guys that are not in the top eight right now go down to 16 there are a lot of really quality options there for me
1823092 any of those guys im happy with and theres none of those eight guys that know for sure they are going to be on this team
1823093 i understand the bulldogs disappointment but if he wasnt playing with toulon he would have joined another rugby team for example saracens
1823094 he plans to stay in rugby if we didnt feel that he was highly motivated to play rugby we would not have started negotiations with him
1823095 he had seen everything in rugby league he wants to try a new adventure with rugby it is his choice his deal is not worth the exorbitant amounts that have been claimed it is a sporting choice
1823096 this transfer was most complicated to realise because we knew that the news in the media would be enormous
1823097 when i saw the transfer of mark gasnier to stade francais and people spoke about him like he was the star that amused me because in france we have a real ignorance of rugby league because sonny bill williams is the uncontested star
1823098 if he decided to defy an injunction ordered by a judge in the nsw supreme court he would certainly face some serious penalties and that includes the freezing of any assets he may have here in australia
1823099 williams and his management have been served subpoenas so were just waiting to get into court
1823100 let me get this right a woman kills another for the love of a man who has no job no home and no future there is indeed a lid for every pot
1823101 that is one homeless person down now if only they would all take care of each other so that those of us who work and pay taxes can enjoy our city honestly they have time to have sex love triangles and make all kinds of friends and sex partners they could find time to get jobs at least now this one woman has another solution to the homeless problem
1823102 ok lets recap in the heart of center city we have two homeless woment fighting for the affection of another homeless guy and one kills the other they have the energy to kill but not to work
1823103 get them off the street enough is enough the rubbish the crime the exposing of themsleves and the filth this is an easy solution enforce the no camping these people dont want help they want to have teh right to live on our streets and our parks have sex fornicate and relieve themselves in public how long does this city need to be subjected to this

1823107 you dont have to win over everybody to gain from a campaign stop
1823108 the military is not monolithic it leans republican but it doesnt mean there arent people in the military and military spouses who might be persuaded to support obama
1823109 this taps into a side of the military that takes a beating when it comes to deployments but doesnt get a lot of media attention theres a good bit of frustration in that segment of the military and it might be possible to persuade them to support barack obama
1823110 when fuel gets more expensive wont voters object just as strenuously as they would have if a carbon tax had been imposed in the first place
1823111 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1823112 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1823113 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1823114 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1823115 i remember watching that film and being caught up in the emotion as we all were
1823116 i thought whoever did this really captured this town and the importance of the strand
1823117 johns very passionate about the museum and the community and his enthusiasm is very contagious i couldnt be happier the way it worked out i met a lot of great people
1823118 it was our intent to interview people from the community rather than museum people
1823119 its designed to be accurate and uplifting and have a long shelf life
1823120 i think she comes across as someone who had her communitys best interest at heart
1823121 he said everyone was saying this is a fishing town why do we need an art museum here
1823122 the stakes could not be higher everything hinges on stopping coal
1823123 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1823124 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
1823125 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
1823126 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
1823127 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
1823128 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
1823129 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
1823130 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
1823131 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
1823132 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
1823133 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
1823134 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
1823135 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
1823136 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
1823137 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
1823138 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
1823139 you have a company that used to post above the main line grocery stores posting more in line with grocery so i think thats suggesting a share shift
1823140 think that it means its a permanent shift i just think the economy is weighing on everybody

1823147 glosses over all of the hot button issues that come with reggaeton poverty racism and misogyny but like reggaeton itself the film beats to the idea that theres more to music that meets the ear and that finding out where music comes from is a vital way to make sense of ourselves and the world

1823212 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1823213 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1823214 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change

1823225 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1823226 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1823227 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late

1823233 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1823234 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1823235 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world

1823246 my heart goes out to the families of the victims as well as to the community and the whole u p i was raised in the up and i know how much we yoopers value the serenity and safety that goes with living there when i was a kid we didnt even have a lock on our front door it wasnt needed and were not talking that long ago this kind of senseless act will bring the community together but will also leave scars that will make people think twice about their safety
1823247 i demand to know where al gore is declaring that this rise in the lake levels is all just media bunk and that were all still doomed because of global warming
1823248 he wants to tax oil companies profits which will raise the price of gas and use the money to help motorist pay for the more expensive gas is this robbing peter to pay peter
1823249 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them
1823250 all im saying is that if barack obama had gone to an event with 20 000 people wasting gas to talk about energy and said that his wife should have simulated sucking a banana dick between another womans legs this race would be over

1823262 people may think about not sending their kids to boarding school
1823263 so much adverse media publicity so as to deny her any chance of re election to the state office of which she is the incumbent
1823264 this step is simply a treachery and a trump card in the hands of azerbaijan
1823265 legally the initiative is crass ignorance politically it is an absurdity
1823266 there is an opinion that some power still remains in robert kocharians hands and that the collection of signatures is a sort of event for domestic consumption i dont think it will acquire any serious scale
1823267 w ith methods like these an attempt is made to restore 1988 when with his influence levon ter petrosian managed to unite the people
1823268 this time the opposition simply tries to keep the tension alive it is a game the carnival goes on
1823269 it just doesnt look like its anything worth writing home about

1823271 the two sides should find out a third model which will be of benefit to both sides

1823299 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1823300 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1823301 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1823302 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1823303 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1823304 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles

1823308 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1823309 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water

1823311 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1823312 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good

1823350 failed to address amp the steady decline of well paying work
1823351 the interesting question on the table is what is or was the purpose of the control board
1823352 initiate and assure the implementation of appropriate measures to secure the financial stability of the city
1823353 to stem the bleeding and to do the immediate work
1823354 no place will welcome disbanding elected offices and replacing them with unelected officials
1823355 if we concentrate on the budget this will give the city the opportunity to focus on economic development
1823356 its not for folks from out of town to tell them how to lead their lives
1823357 youve got 30 years worth of problems but in two years someone didnt snap their fingers and fix it
1823358 theres a massive split between skills sets and the jobs available
1823359 so we can prove to the market that downtown living can work for springfield
1823360 one of the toughest things ever to do is build consensus
1823361 people dont look at springfield as a place of opportunity they look at it as a place of worry
1823362 going through the holyoke range is like going through the cumberland gap
1823363 its so critical to anchor this end of the state
1823364 we have the infrastructure that will support people moving back in
1823365 financial mismanagement an embarrassingly antiquated tax collection system a variety of ill conceived economic development plans political corruption and soaring crime all contributed to the citys demise
1823366 greater springfield deindustrialization staggering job loss a shrinking revenue base and grinding decline
1823367 the city and the vast majority of its elected local state and national officials simply whistled a happy tune clicked their heels together like dorothy in the land of oz and assumed everything would work out it did not
1823368 but what trumps these factors is something the control board failed to address in its first two years of running the city the steady decline of well paid work
1823369 for most of the last two centuries the connecticut river valley with springfield as its leading city related to the rest of the country and the world as a stellar manufacturing center its metalworkers and machinery builders fueling the nations industrial revolution
1823370 jobs have been created but the manufacturing base that was the foundation of the whole connecticut river valley from hartford up into never been able to manage to come back
1823371 the well paying work that made greater springfield a mecca for skilled blue collar workers went away and nothing comparable has been able to replace that
1823372 its distressing to think amp there was just nothing really done to stave off the decline
1823373 as jobs disappeared and wages fell the lack of an urgent and cogent response exacerbated the citys financial crisis
1823374 w hat next where will well paying work come from how can we educate the people losing their jobs to facilitate their transition into other high paying work how can we leverage the tremendous research and educational resources of the connecticut river valleys numerous colleges and universities to engage in long term efforts to rebuild the employment infrastructure how can we head off the economic misery that confronts working families
1823375 it became a much larger problem than just springfield and people felt generally helpless about what to do
1823376 any of the mayors that came along at this time from richie neal on none of them could have prevented this disinvestment by these large manufacturers
1823377 theyd call me back and say bob they said theyre not leaving
1823378 i think the bigger forces in the end were always going to win
1823379 the firms were always going to go the loyalty to the greater springfield area was gone
1823380 what could have made a difference was people being more honest about what this all meant while it was happening and really trying to figure out whats going on next people like then state rep and 2001 mayoral candidate paul caron were saying this is happening and people were saying no everything is fine youre exaggerating there was a sense that talking about it made it worse
1823381 that just increased the cynicism in the city that more than anything else
1823382 private investors say why would we go to springfield the guy were dealing with could be in jail tomorrow it takes a long time to recover from something like that in terms of private investor confidence
1823383 in terms of a working class standard of living that had a huge impact
1823384 they were really sent in there to manage decline not to try to figure out how to regrow springfield
1823385 they were there to downsize the city downsize services and in effect lowered the quality of life for the residents of the city
1823386 when it became evident that several generations of mayors had mismanaged the finances and there were these clear budget shortfalls something had to be done
1823387 but setting it up in such a way taking a pound of flesh from public employees reducing services it was set up from the beginning as a fight and i dont think it had to be like that
1823388 i read what they say theyre going to do but i cant really tell whats going on
1823389 how do you encourage people to invest in a city a waterfront new retail condo developments in an economy which is really just sapping capital out of the market amp
1823390 i wish what people are trying to do now they had tried several years ago when romney put the board in
1823391 there used to be energy along the connecticut river valley
1823392 im all for making things attractive and pleasant and drawing in new restaurants
1823393 now a new armory a new catalyst for sustainable prosperity is required
1823394 fiscal belt tightening a long term freeze on teachers wages and fanciful notions that tourist attractions will somehow grow a plentiful supply of well paying jobs cannot arrest the citys and regions slump the region is in danger of having its skilled labor base permanently eroded
1823395 i think the strategy now is to try to do everything possible to raise the wages of the growing population of workers in the caregiver sectors
1823396 you cant have people making so little and expect the area to be prosperous we have to think about these jobs and what theyre worth and pay them accordingly
1823397 but where is it going to come from it looks so overwhelming people might look at the problems and not want to even try it
1823398 it seems theres a lack of democratic process in the city
1823399 part of the solution is to rebuild this sense of civic participation and try to heal the wounds in the city amp
1823400 when you want to figure out a way to redevelop a place thats been hard hit you want to create what economists call a virtuous circle of collaboration
1823401 the city insisted on an open set of conversations over months for people to talk about what they want to see in the city
1823402 its clear as the project has been defined and redefined that the input has really been used its not a fake im pleasantly surprised and encouraged by it this is something springfield will definitely need to do
1823403 its a city of these neighborhoods and certain neighborhoods are represented and some arent amp somebody really needs to provide some leadership im not a fan of a lot of presidential politics but the city needs a version of barack obama that leadership optimism energy
1823404 i married when i was 26 and my husband was 33 but i didnt feel pressure to have kids right away
1823405 i got married when i was 26 and in the past eight years we have grown together and figured out life as a team we still dont have children but weve traveled all over the world moved to different states and had the ability to take more exciting chances together were supportive of each other and communicate much better than i imagine we would have if we wed in our 30s
1823406 if id married any of the guys i was madly in love with in my 20s id be divorced by now i wed in my late 30s after being with my boyfriend for ten years if i had married him a decade prior id be divorced now we were both too young and immature for the responsibilities of marriage however everyone is different and what works for some might not work for others
1823407 i married my husband in my 20s and we are approaching 20 years of marriage i think that would be defined as success and yet ive certainly wondered what it would have been like had i acquired more relationship experience before marrying my husband
1823408 i got married when i was 32 on the one hand i got to sow my wild oats before settling down but i also think it had a negative effect exposing myself to different types of men made me aware of how great guys can be in many different ways as a result im a little hard on my husband because i expect him to have every wonderful trait ive ever come across in a man

1823410 coach vigilante has the background and experience needed to provide leadership for the future success of our track and field and cross country programs
1823411 often teams take on the personality of their coaches if that is the case our teams will show a high energy level and great enthusiasm which will translate into success in and out of the classroom
1823412 we were extremely pleased with the high quality of interest we received from very accomplished coaches during our national search process
1823413 ultimately we determined that jason would be the best fit to lead our track and cross country programs to new heights and we are thrilled that he will join us at the university of virginia
1823414 having the opportunity to become the director of the track and field and cross country programs at virginia accomplishes a lifelong dream of mine to become a head coach
1823415 as an added bonus having the opportunity to move to the east coast is an ideal situation for my family im so grateful for my time at texas all of the people i have been able to work with have been wonderful deloss dodds butch worley bubba thornton all of the sudent athletes and everyone who has treated me so well over the past nine years i am thankful optimistic and excited about what my experiences will bring in the upcoming years as a virginia cavalier

1823417 what we just try to do is try to replace the aggregate performance by the unit obviously its more easily schemed up on defense where you can account for the production more so than it is when you account for blocks
1823418 those guys are gone they were great for us but time moves on and weve moved on to the future without them this is a new team with a different personality
1823419 we feel like were establishing a reputation for developing offensive linemen
1823420 all of them have developed throughout the course of their careers monroe is the only one between albert ferguson and himself who was hindered by injuries early in his career so he didnt have the opportunity for the same consistency and repetition that the others did but now that hes being able to build up those repetitions his game is really starting to move along nicely hes got very good athletic ability and has been one of the hardest workers on the team he really knows whats going on at his position and hes got a lot of focus at it
1823421 he had one of the most positive timeframes in the spring
1823422 he seemed to be pretty well focused during the summer he knows whats going on and he can play all the positions hopefully that will be a real aid in there to some of the other players
1823423 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1823424 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1823425 my eyes were closed and it was bright it was just bam bam and i saw the flashes i mean they were that bright
1823426 youve heard the old adage that lightning never strikes the same place twice well its just the exact opposite is true theres really two issues with lightning one is to protect the physical structure with lightning rods the other is to protect the electronics inside
1823427 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1823428 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1823429 socrates do you know what i just heard about your friend
1823430 before telling me anything id like you to pass a little test its called the triple filter test
1823431 before you talk to me about my friend it might be a good idea to take a moment and filter what youre going to say the first filter is truth have you made absolutely sure that what you are about to tell me is true
1823432 so you dont really know if its true or not now lets try the second filter the filter of goodness is what you are about to tell me about my friend something good
1823433 you want to tell me something bad about him but youre not certain its true you may still pass the test though because theres one filter left the filter of usefulness is what you want to tell me about my friend going to be useful to me
1823434 if what you want to tell me is neither true nor good nor even useful why tell it to me at all
1823435 nice to meet you peter but im a muslim and i want to meet muhammad

1823474 dont actually care about human rights but it is way for the cry babies to get some attention and to oppose the president
1823475 in jedem land der welt auch in der bundesrepublik deutschland werden internetseiten gesperrt bei uns sind es rechtsradikale seiten die gesperrt werden und es ist nat rlich auch in china so dass einzelne seiten gesperrt werden
1823476 es ist ungeheuerlich wenn strafverfolgung gegen internetseiten mit strafrechtlicher relevanz in deutschland mit der blockierung von seiten von amnesty international in china verglichen wird
1823477 die falsche behauptung der dalai lama wolle eine spaltung chinas ist eines der hauptargumente der chinesischen staatspropaganda gegen den dalai lama
1823478 er habe die sperrung von rechtsradikalen internetseiten in deutschland nicht auf eine stufe mit der internetzensur in china stellen wollen
1823479 die sperrung von internetseiten in deutschland sei im sinne der menschenrechte f r notwendig

1823482 der einfluss ist immer noch vorhanden dass sie wollen dass dies geschieht die haben wahrscheinlich selbst keinen bestimmten tag festgelegt um es zu tun aber sie warten auf eine gelegenheit und irgendetwas wird sich ergeben
1823483 der traurige teil an der sache ist dass viele leute nicht berrascht sein werden es ist tragisch es ist traurig es muss nur eines unserer schiffe getroffen werden und ein haufen amerikaner sterben und ein zwei nachrichtensender m ssen berichten dass es die iraner gewesen waren und das land wird bereit daf r sein in den krieg zu ziehen die werden sogar eine wehrpflicht ausrufen wollen um zu sagen dass wir losziehen m ssen um israel zu retten dass wir einmarschieren m ssen und deshalb eine wehrpflicht brauchen das ist der schlimmste teil den ich bef rchte
1823484 inszenierten vorfall im stil des golf von tonkin der durchaus geschehen k nnte um die unterst tzung im volk f r einen angriff gegen den iran zu gewinnen
1823485 ich finde es immer noch v llig frappierend wenn ich sehe wie m nner und frauen im kongress die ich kenne und sch tze dies tun nur um nicht anzuecken dies meisten von ihnen sagen ich stimme dir bei allem zu was du sagst aber die iraner sind ble menschen und k nnten uns eines tages angreifen ich h re mitglieder des kongresses sagen wenn wir sie doch nur mit nuklearwaffen angreifen k nnten

1823490 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1823491 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

1823496 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1823497 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1823498 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1823499 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1823500 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1823501 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1823502 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1823503 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1823504 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1823505 the nice thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every cell type in the body the difficult thing about embryonic stem cells is that they can make every type of cell in the body
1823506 and so when you push them to specialize they tend to make different cell types were trying to control that process and identify the genes that get the cells down a pathway and then hold them at the start
1823507 our goal is to recreate what happens in the embryo but in the dish
1823508 and so for us this is truly a step forward in understanding what genes can control cell fate and use them to make clinically relevant tissue
1823509 and a new 199 price point in line with the iphone
1823510 we note that the macbook has had the same design since its launch over two years ago and the macbook pro has had essentially the same design since its launch over 2 5 years ago which was very similar in design to the powerbook g4 released over 5 5 years ago
1823511 to compare the long running imac g5 design lasted three years
1823512 are just the beginning of apples exploration of multi touch on the mac
1823513 currently these gestures require the same touch sensing technology used in the iphone but they use a traditional looking trackpad
1823514 eventually we expect apple to change the trackpad to backlit color screens for a more dynamic user interface on the mac
1823515 not until the technology has fully matured over the next 2 3 years
1823516 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
1823517 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
1823518 an adequate explanation for his late laboratory work hours around the time of
1823519 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1823520 we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
1823521 has been the sole custodian of rmr 1029 since it was first grown in 1997
1823522 the contaminant must have been introduced during the production of the post and brokaw spores
1823523 that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behaviour
1823524 repeatedly named other researchers as possible mailers and claimed that the anthrax used in the attacks resembled that of another researcher
1823525 these storms depend on warm water as they move northward
1823526 if the waters are cool its like turning the thermostat down
1823527 more storms in the south likely will equate to more potential for storms in the north atlantic it is of concern obviously if people are raising their projections weve already had five tropical storms including the two hurricanes and the peak season doesnt really get going until mid august
1823528 if the weather pattern is unfavourable for hurricanes in our area which it certainly is now then the water could be 26 degrees here and it wouldnt make any difference
1823529 i heard the police sirens yesterday but its safe today
1823530 there are all kinds of people walking along that street
1823531 oh hey the real world is too painful to deal with
1823532 f ck validation the project is yours lets sign in before you can post messages
1823533 i just hope the bloke and his manager david riolo decide to agree with the proposal that we have put to him because it provides him with an opportunity to get his life and career back in order
1823534 ive had a bit to do with todd and hes a good kid
1823535 he couldnt have been any better than he was in the country camp but it is clear from other things that have happened that he has a few issues to do with alcohol that he needs to address
1823536 that part of the penalty that deals with his intake of alcohol is the most important part of the plan in my view
1823537 i think todd should accept the penalty i think the five point plan protects the player as much as it does the club and gives him an opportunity to get himself right anyone with the track record todd has must realise he cant afford to do anything silly or irresponsible
1823538 two years off the drink isnt a bad option i think hes got a contract reportedly worth 400 000 a year so hes got a commitment to the club he may feel a bit hard done by but thats the proposition that is in front of him and i dont think hes got a lot of options
1823539 my advice to him would be to accept it and prove to everyone that he can come back next season as a stronger person and maybe an even better player as well hopefully he feels that way too and accepts that he has got a responsibility i would much prefer todd reaches his potential and i think this is the way for him to move forward
1823540 i went over to the desk explained what i was wanting and what the case worker had said to me and he said no
1823541 i asked if there was any way we could sort it out and he just said eff off
1823542 he didnt say it he mouthed it at me which was real hurtful because there was a real smirk on his face right in front of my son i was so upset
1823543 even if i did which i didnt he should never speak to people like that
1823544 he actually said i called him a faggot which i didnt
1823545 even if i was in the wrong even if i did say that his job is to deal with situations and to deal with people who are like that
1823546 in this case it is an employment matter once all the facts are established and weve concluded the investigation then appropriate action will be taken
1823547 it was unbelievable how brave he was even when he was being attacked he yelled to me to wind my window up in my vehicle as the dogs could turn on me
1823548 it was remarkable how he kept it all together throughout the ordeal he remained totally cool and calm
1823549 i feel very privileged to have both of you here today no one can prepare themselves for what they will do when confronted by such a situation
1823550 many people arriving at that scene would have gone for help or dialled 111 but you chose to intervene directly and it is indeed a privilege to be able to recognise your actions here today
1823551 please give mrs robinson an award she saved the life of my friend
1823552 prison is a difficult and sometimes volatile environment and unfortunately incidents do occur from time to time
1823553 many prisoners have long histories of resorting to violence to resolve problems or when they are frustrated
1823554 the prison will be conducting a full review into the circumstances surrounding the incident
1823555 we have completed a scene examination and we will be assessing the information we have and speaking to any witnesses
1823556 the time has come to revisit the legal framework identify the kinds of outcomes we want from 21st century liquor laws and have a look at the whole balance of rights and responsibilities again
1823557 that was really not parliaments intention you needed to have a reasonably substantial business that was selling liquor and that got away on them a bit
1823558 everything is up for review if youre giving discounts to get people into the store whether or not that is a good idea is arguable
1823559 my oldest is a senior at iu and he is a music major so obviously the band has had an influence for him
1823560 its a lot of going to practices its a lot of fun its great
1823561 i just walked under it its nice a cool people taking a break
1823562 theres not too many of them left but i see most of them in southern indiana its nice seeing one here at the state fair
1823563 its kind of crunchy outside with a creamy banana center to it with a brown sugar like taste to it and then they got ice cream with it it kind of tops it off like a sundae would

1823565 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1823566 i suspect if he picked hillary it would help him some
1823567 i think the senator is going to do better than expected we are realistic to know that he is swimming upstream in many parts of the state
1823568 however in other parts of the state particularly the urban areas he has a tremendous amount of momentum we are hoping that urban momentum will counter any losses we might suffer out in the state
1823569 as we get closer and closer to the election i think that momentum is going to increase
1823570 were working very diligently with both the zap company and with integrity manufacturing about the possibility of locating a manufacturing facility here

1823575 you will see a lot of numbers with a lot of zeros behind them trust me they are supposed to be there
1823576 are you better off than you were four or eight years ago
1823577 eight years ago gas was 1 50 do you remember that
1823578 when we were shooting our first feature the puffy chair we had long drives between where we were staying and where we were shooting with stretches of just woods
1823579 inevitably with eight people in a van driving through the woods we started talking about scary stuff
1823580 it became the opposite direction from cloverfield which had the villain the size of rhode island
1823581 we couldnt beat that so we went with the most low fi version of horror films both small and ridiculous
1823582 the reference point for us was what if it were happening in the real world and not just the dreamy world of teenagers taking showers we wanted create a situation that was real where you know these characters and introduce the scary element into it
1823583 our goal was to scare the audience but also to make them laugh and to not take it too seriously
1823584 we wanted a great experience because some things in this life are a little scary or funny or stupid
1823585 it will be funny but you have to mine the reality of what it is and slowly let it play out looking at the character of chad you know hes had the struggle of rejection in his life
1823586 everyone has that type of rejection on a weekly basis
1823587 our hope is of the three things going on in this movie the relationship stuff the comedy stuff and the horror stuff the audience will find something to connect to
1823588 its about the characters and if you like them youll like the film then well make 750 million laughter
1823589 they represent everyone but in our world the epitome of the human being who wants something theyre probably never going to have is the desperate actor it is horrifying and beautiful at the same time
1823590 mumblecore are films made really cheaply on digital video often with improvised dialogue and unprofessional actors that tends to focus on realism in relationships and a distinct lack of plot
1823591 we like more plot and use professional actors but we do tend to focus on the relationships
1823592 in baghead the short film shown at the festival in the beginning is hardcore mumblecore
1823593 we made a lot of bad movies for a long time until we hit onto something that was watchable
1823594 it instills a very healthy fear of making a piece of shit that keeps us on our toes its real easy to make a bad movie and really hard to make a good one
1823595 money is an issue but the reality is about honing your vision and living and growing as an artist
1823596 if you are rich the high energy prices are an annoyance if you are poor or middle class it becomes a life or death situation its hitting us at the pump now in the fall its going to hit us in home heating costs in the spring its going to hit us in food prices it has a ripple effect we want a vote on a the american energy act comprehensive energy package that covers everything
1823597 my constituents are concerned about the lack of leadership when it comes to getting something done on the energy crisis
1823598 what i wanted to see in jackson and particularly in fondren was an art gallery featuring multi ethnic and multicultural reflections
1823599 i wanted to see more sculpture and different types of abstract art in an atmosphere thats upscale comfortable and relaxed
1823600 it seems to be very professional and at the same time very interested in art not just in the classical sense but in terms of its impact on culture
1823601 i think i bring a perspective and an experience a lot of jacksonians can relate to and thats perhaps a bit different from what has been most commonly represented
1823602 we are telling the rest of the world to produce more yet we have laws in our country saying we have to produce less
1823603 we are asking for bipartisanship lets debate the issue listen to the issue and then make the choice
1823604 why wont speaker pelosi come back and have a vote on american energy because she is trying to save the planet this isnt convincing becasue we have the cleanest energy production in the world i am asking speaker pelosi to come back down to earth so we can all save the planet
1823605 there is nobody doing more to help the opec nations than the democrat leaders we are helping grow these sharks who want to devour us
1823606 more american made energy means lower gas prices it means greater national security it means more american jobs and a stronger economy buying oil from and thereby funding enemies like hugo chavez is dangerous and indefensible why would we spend 1 2 billion per day on imported oil when we have vast natural resources here at home imagine the boost if this money remained in our economy instead we could invest it in finding and developing alternatives we could create jobs and jumpstart businesses our dependence on foreign oil must stop now today
1823607 we urge republicans to keep up the good fight on behalf of all americans polls have consistently indicated that americans republicans and democrats alike want homegrown solutions to the energy problem
1823608 both parties should be back in washington d c brainstorming how to move forward to solve the long term problem of energy dependency
1823609 t he rotation of 20 to 30 republican rebels seems to be a serious effort to address the energy issue they are sticking around while democrats are pursuing their five week vacation i ts the republicans who have been doggedly pressing for an energy debate and it was pelosi who used parliamentary acrobatics to avoid a debate precisely because she didnt want to risk the chance for such legislation to come to a vote
1823610 on friday pelosi started the five week recess by ordering the house lights microphones and cameras shut off but rep john shadegg punched in several computer codes until he figured out how to turn the microphones back on then pelosi told media in the press gallery to leave but shadegg ran upstairs and held forth for the reporters triggering an obscure rule that allowed the media to ignore pelosis directive well played
1823611 on energy democrats in office means a return to the 1970s
1823612 right now our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind
1823613 the argument that increased supply lowers prices makes sense but the public is entitled to a full debate on drilling
1823614 the play is a tacky bit of filthy sodomite propaganda with no literary merit and zero redeeming social value masquerading as legitimate theater it is of the fags by the fags and for the fags designed only to mock the world of god and the servants of god
1823615 extreme makeover home edition advises each family to consult a financial planner after they receive their new home ultimately financial matters are personal and we work to respect the privacy of the families
1823616 this has been a distraction for the last two years but im not going to let it stop me from doing the things i have to
1823617 as any individual whose been indicted particularly on a similar charge to what hes already gone through hes somewhat disconcerted
1823618 im very disappointed because i have worked so hard on fighting crime in this city
1823619 to injure oppress threaten and intimidate e w welch and j s sutton
1823620 there was a warrant out for e w s arrest recio and wright had the right to arrest him
1823621 the mayor did mention the timing to me from a political standpoint
1823622 a cat has nine lives and he probably has 11
1823623 i just never figured that they would get to this point
1823624 they came and interviewed me the fbi and the u s attorney who is doing this case
1823625 they talked to me about an hour at city hall
1823626 a lot of people feel this is the same thing that already has been dealt with
1823627 even if people find me disappointing ultimately they might gain something
1823628 it just encourages the narcissism that is already a congenital defect for a politician
1823629 i find these essays more revealing about the author than about me
1823630 when i speak about having lived in indonesia having family that is impoverished in africa knowing the leaders is not important
1823631 i tell him hey barack youve got a few things going on right
1823632 you dont go from being a community organizer to running for president in 15 years unless you have a lot of ambition
1823633 he likes to listen carefully and naturally you assume thats very smart of him
1823634 he listened to patterns of speech how to take people up the ladders
1823635 its almost a baptist tradition to make someone faint and by god hes doing it now
1823636 fiction kind of took me out of myself and what we were doing every day
1823637 im lucky if i get through a chapter of anything
1823638 i have come to realize the secret to sleeping on the road is to get very very tired
1823639 look i dont want to sound too noble the first time youre on the cover of time magazine and the crowds are cheering thats not bad right
1823640 but one thing ive learned about myself is that the surface glitter the vanity element of this campaign becomes less satisfying as i go along
1823641 comes across as someone who stored away for future consideration practically everything that was ever said to him and who had a talent for watchfulness part of the extraordinary armor he developed at an early age
1823642 i love when im shaking hands on a rope line and
1823643 i see little old white ladies and big burly black guys and latino girls and all their hands are entwining theyre feeding on each other as much as on me
1823644 in jedem land der welt auch in der bundesrepublik deutschland werden internetseiten gesperrt bei uns sind es rechtsradikale seiten die gesperrt werden und es ist nat rlich auch in china so dass einzelne seiten gesperrt werden
1823645 es ist ungeheuerlich wenn strafverfolgung gegen internetseiten mit strafrechtlicher relevanz in deutschland mit der blockierung von seiten von amnesty international in china verglichen wird
1823646 die falsche behauptung der dalai lama wolle eine spaltung chinas ist eines der hauptargumente der chinesischen staatspropaganda gegen den dalai lama
1823647 er habe die sperrung von rechtsradikalen internetseiten in deutschland nicht auf eine stufe mit der internetzensur in china stellen wollen
1823648 die sperrung von internetseiten in deutschland sei im sinne der menschenrechte f r notwendig
1823649 daher schlug er vor dass sich suchmaschinen auf ihre kernkompetenz beschr nken oder auf diese rechtlich beschr nkt werden sollten
1823650 politische blogs sind in deutschland so gut wie nicht vorhanden

1823652 sir alex ferguson heard my arguments i heard his and in fact it was settled that the best for both parties would be for me to stay
1823653 therefore i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
1823654 before rumours emerge saying that i will play against my will i want to make this clear whoever says or writes that is lying
1823655 i will play for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as always
1823656 i was responsible for all this controversy i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily responsible for the poor relationship between the two clubs
1823657 i knew real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united
1823658 somebody get a f ing corn dog in his hand now
1823659 magic isnt just a bag of tricks its a finely tuned technology for shaping what we see
1823660 i think we were right on the issues and we were able to network and gain the confidence of the people
1823661 and i think that the vote showed that we got our base out and networked very well with the rest of the folks in the district
1823662 this is a good day and a win for the high road
1823663 and people are hungry for that theyre hungry for a positive campaign on the issues
1823664 ive already started to hear labels beginning to be put on
1823665 that rhetoric of labels liberal vs conservative urban vs rural those are only meant to divide us and then we stop working on the solution that we need people are tired of that old politics
1823666 my daughter is a very family girl she loves children and i know that she and michael have been hoping for this for a long time
1823667 it was a time of awareness and women fighting for specific causes that meant a lot to us
1823668 as far as my part i wrote a lot of songs
1823669 i was there to learn about the rights of women and the rights of men and what we should do together to better the world
1823670 i dont know how else to take it all i can do is laugh
1823671 i was surprised to see rita macneils name mainly because i didnt know that she had been involved in feminist groups in the early 80s
1823672 they were being spied on because at the time they were perceived to be very radical
1823673 when you look at canadian society the way it has changed over the last 40 years it has changed dramatically especially when it comes to gender relations and these womens groups are largely responsible for that
1823674 the police didnt perceive that this change was coming about because they werent looking in that direction basically
1823675 these self contained goals will offer new challenges satisfy goal oriented players allow others to see your accomplishments in world of warcraft and are just plain fun
1823676 this is the kind of movie i would run out to see
1823677 the kind of movies i watch are definitely guys movies this is departed this is fear this is all those characters times 10
1823678 i did one other cameo in the entourage pilot but i didnt get to do a scene with jeremy piven
1823679 this time its me and piven going at it so it was fun
1823680 either non existent or burdensome while showing positive depictions of extra marital or adulterous sexual relationships with alarming frequency
1823681 these study results suggest that many in hollywood are actively seeking to undermine marriage by consistently showing it in a negative manner
1823682 throughout much of the history of broadcast television the networks adhered to a voluntary code of conduct which stipulated that respect should be maintained for the sanctity of marriage and the value of the home our report finds that not only are the boundaries no longer respected they have been obliterated
1823683 theres the expectation that television is some reflection of reality reality television isnt even a reflection of reality
1823684 have these people been living in a cave i mean pre marital sex extra martial sex its not like this is new to television its been around for a while
1823685 the thing i find encouraging is a lot of these shows are going beyond that and reinforcing non traditional families with single parents or same sex parents
1823686 broadcasters knowing televisions ability to influence behavior must exercise greater responsibility when handling sexual situations during primetime hours opting for less graphic visual content and favoring storylines that dont celebrate promiscuity glamorize criminality or denigrate monogamy
1823687 its hard on my server to find tanks and i dont know many people that enjoy tanking why the hating
1823688 i dont know many people that like to tank why do you love it
1823689 it takes a nation of millions to hold us back
1823690 its the kind of show you have to bring something to you cant just come and sit back and let it happen you have to bring your memories you have to bring your 1993 self
1823691 when you first mention it to artists a lot of them their initial reaction is whats wrong with our new stuff
1823692 some people mistake what were doing with dont look back that were just trying to be quite retro
1823693 after every single record ive finished ive said in my own head or to other people wouldnt it be great if we could just go out and perform it top to bottom
1823694 as i perform the songs i had the time and focus to really think about what i was thinking about when i wrote that song
1823695 i put off listening to the album for a long time
1823696 the first time i tried to listen to it i couldnt even make it all the way through it it was kind of boring to me but after a few listens it grew on me
1823697 were trying to get it back to sounding like the record
1823698 even the songs that weve been playing its relearning those
1823699 im looking forward to a whole tour of not having to make any set lists
1823700 i have such a huge catalogue now that i dont get to play a lot of the songs
1823701 and i miss a lot of them we only have so much room in the set i loved the idea because it kind of satisfied my need to get all those songs out again
1823702 although we werent able to shatter that highest hardest glass ceiling this time thanks to you its got about 18 million cracks in it
1823703 kevin declares a long night fades in our memories as 23l grows larger in the windscreen
1823704 theres no moving map wind direction indicator vnav lnav autothrust or speed select
1823705 ok the airfield is in front of me but now on this heading its off my left and now its at my
1823706 was that last clearance turn right to 180 or slow to 180
1823707 we are very excited to be releasing the pc version of grand theft auto iv
1823708 the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
1823709 anabolic refers to their body building effects think mark mcgwire and androgenic simply means related to male sex hormones
1823710 we will have this discussion and debate for all missourians
1823711 she has been a courageous public servant and tenacious campaigner
1823712 its not his personality to attack people he will define differences
1823713 for 20 years i havent had to raise or spend a penny until this year and im humbled by the help and support i received
1823714 whats really important is that we brought the assessors role to the surface
1823715 people have learned a lot out of this campaign exactly what the assessor does and that they need to be informed about the issues that go on there so i think we accomplished that
1823716 i think what happened was part of the knowledge we imparted was his own web site where this information was and people started to use it
1823717 i think we pushed the envelope with technology as much as we could but quit playing defensive a month ago
1823718 i decided to just say this is who i am and this is the job ive done
1823719 lets face it the assessor doesnt wear a white hat i am the tax man
1823720 today when i was at the polls so many people came up and introduced themselves and said yes you came to my door
1823721 and that seems to be a key in a race this size
1823722 mary ran a good race she should be proud of herself shes going to be a good state representative
1823723 he and his campaign crew they ran this out of his mothers basement thats where the war room was
1823724 and his brother and his friends just dedicated themselves to this campaign they had volunteers galore not only that they had a plan of action for everybody and plugged them in
1823725 i think it was the combination of listening very carefully and closely to people in the community and then just hard work theres no secret thats attached just hard work
1823726 the highlight for me personally was getting out in the district and meeting lots of folks
1823727 i had great support from my supporters and that was really good to see
1823728 peluang dan tantangan formalisasi syariat islam di indonesia kasus surakarta yang diselenggarakan oleh stain surakarta 14 04
1823729 kebenaran semua syariat islam itu mutlak karena konseptornya adalah allah barang siapa menolak kelak akan tersandung
1823730 penerapan syariat islam tidak perlu didahului oleh upaya peningkatan kesejahteraan masyarakat rasululullah ketika mendirikan negara islam madinah juga tidak melakukan hal itu
1823731 justru dialog yang seperti ini perlu digulirkan secara nyata di masyarakat
1823732 buku dibalas dengan buku tulisan dibalas dengan tulisan tidak dibalas dengan kekerasan dan mata pedang
1823733 secara metodologis hasil penelitian itu harus didiskusikan lagi apakah hasil sudah valid siapa saja respondennya dan teori siapa yang dipakai serta metode yang digunakan
1823734 kalau soal riset teman teman di kppsi komite persiapan penegakan syariat islam juga punya dan hasilnya 70 persen mendukung makanya saya tidak mau ambil pusing dengan riset lsi itu
1823735 idealisme terhadap pancasila bisa pula dianggap pilihan mayoritas rakyat indonesia agar negara kita mengembangkan sistem yang berakar dari kultur tradisi dan sejarah indonesia sendiri
1823736 sejak bung karno hingga era susilo bambang yudhoyono mereka dipimpin oleh presiden yang memiliki komitmen kuat sekali dengan keberagaman yang disimbolkan oleh pancasila bahkan presiden abdurrahman wahid adalah penggagas keberagaman itu
1823737 bagi saya lsi bukan sebuah lembaga yang memiliki kredibilitas tinggi penelitian yang dilakukan lsi hasilnya bisa saja dipengaruhi oleh siapa sponsornya atau istilahnya by order seandainya penelitian atau survei itu dilakukan oleh lipi mungkin hasilnya lebih valid
1823738 ada dua nilai dalam penelitian yang harus dicari yaitu validitas dan reliabilitas hasil penelitian lsi bisa saja objektif tapi tidak representatif karena harus diukur semua komponen penelitian yang saya sebutkan tadi
1823739 partai islam harus melakukan adaptasi dan reorientasi sesuai kecenderungan umat
1823740 i have come to the conclusion that one useless man is a disgrace two are a law firm and three or more are called a congress
1823741 just 12 of voters think congress has passed any legislation to improve life in this country over the past six months
1823742 the president has made this a key part of his legacy
1823743 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1823744 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1823745 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1823746 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1823747 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1823748 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1823749 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1823750 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1823751 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1823752 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1823753 i was very very close to launching it i wanted to see where things fell at the start of the school year
1823754 theres some excitement as to what might be in store for the future but trepidation too
1823755 were losing a lot with her ability and her knowledge
1823756 i am completely surprised by the resignation of dr chase
1823757 at the same time im not surprised at all she did what she thought was good for columbia public schools she thought this timing was appropriate but it caught me by surprise
1823758 hopefully dr chase will continue to make her home in columbia and we can count on her continued support
1823759 the district is ready to start a new year and the board will have extra time to get public input on the type of superintendent we need to look for before beginning a search
1823760 i do believe that for this school year the district will continue to work on financial concerns and student achievement issues
1823761 proposing to save 250 000 by taking personal lamps coffeepots and microwaves away from teachers that is an incredibly bad leadership failure
1823762 those are things there for morale and by simply removing them she has created a situation for people who have become used to those as part of a daily normal routine when you have 20 minutes or less to eat lunch and youre not going to eat lunch
1823763 elections are not ever won by an individual candidate but by the hard work of many people
1823764 im fortunate to have wonderful supporters who have helped every step of the way and i hope theyll continue to be there going forward to november
1823765 i know connies clients pretty well thats just my focus i always wanted to help people and continue connies work
1823766 i went into this knowing that every race i have im going to have a challenger
1823767 so nothing changes as far as my work at the county or how i do my job because i know im going to be opposed its not like most of the other administrative offices that never get a challenge
1823768 that way when were either going to washington to try to get funds to support something or going to jeff city when one of these entities takes it forward the awarding government knows that it is supported by the whole community
1823769 we havent been there because we havent had to we havent felt the economic downturn that many other cities and counties have felt
1823770 its always difficult to challenge an incumbent in your own party but i think she deserved to be challenged
1823771 i respect the voters its a very tribal community and im not part of the right tribe
1823772 from the beginning ive had advice from many people that have been elected that said dont put your own money into the race
1823773 if the public wont support you you dont belong there
1823774 by monday we would like to have someone sitting in the superintendents seat because we know she will be gone
1823775 for our purposes that would not be optimal because we could scare off other candidates
1823776 if the board would like for me to be interim i would be very happy to do that as i am a graduate of hickman high school and went to parkade elementary 50 years ago
1823777 i would certainly be glad to do that if that would be helpful to the school district
1823778 i have too many years with the district not to want it to succeed but there are a number of very qualified people who could step up and do this job
1823779 islam sejajar dengan agama lain bahkan hanya komplemen terhadap paham kebangsaan
1823780 jangan jangan dengan semua itu sama halnya kita sedang menggali lubang kubur untuk bangsa sendiri
1823781 bahkan sebagian umat islam berpendapat kalau sudah ada islam maka agama agama lain seharusnya tidak ada ini sering dikemukakan di mushalla masjid pengajian majelis talim dan bahkan khutbah jumat
1823782 dalam fiqh al siyasah atau fikih politik islam ini biasa disebut al islam din wa daulah islam itu agama sekaligus politik
1823783 bagi mereka ini bukti bahwa sejak awal islam mempunyai cita cita politik untuk merebut kekuasaan negara
1823784 sehinga jika perlu kekuasaan politik itu direbut jadi omong kosong kalau islam tanpa politik
1823785 itu kan paham barat yang dihembuskan pada umat islam supaya mereka tidak ribut soal politik
1823786 tujuan kekuasaan ini tentu saja untuk mengatur agama dan tata kehidupan dunia
1823787 karenanya mereka menginginkan ajaran islam masuk dalam regulasi bahkan menjadi dasar negara tapi dalam perjalanannya keinginan ini sering membuahkan kekecewaan
1823788 malah ada yang mengatakan sebenarnya umat islam berhak mengklaim indonesia sebagai negara umat islam meski ada satu dua orang kristen yang ikut berperang ringkasnya jasa umat islam terlalu besar dalam membentuk negara ini tapi ternyata ideologi islam atau islam politik tidak bisa menjadi dasar negara
1823789 tapi apa yang diperoleh oleh kekuatan islam politik setelah orba naik justru ada proses de ideologisasi islam partai politik islam tidak boleh hidup mereka harus berfusi ke partai persatuan pembangunan ppp
1823790 jabatan jabatan strategis seperti menteri keuangan selalu menjadi langganan orang kristen sehingga menimbulkan kecemburuan di kalangan islam politik
1823791 dan kekecewaan selanjutnya adalah kenyataan bahwa kelompok islam selalu kalah sepanjang sejarah pemilu islam sebagai agama memang bisa mencapai 90 tapi islam sebagai kekuatan politik dalam sejarahnya tidak pernah menang
1823792 obama himself voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure cheney played a major role in developing
1823793 in the defining moment of his life mccain was willing to give everything for one thing and that one thing was his country contrast that with obama
1823794 he put one foot in the institutions he rose through on his journey but never fully engaged
1823795 democrat barack obama on wednesday taunted republican presidential rival john mccain for first mocking the idea of keeping tires inflated for energy conservation and then agreeing the practice works
1823796 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
1823797 yesterday barack obama suggested we put air in our tires to save on gas my friends lets do that but do you think thats enough to break our dependence on middle eastern oil i dont think so so i believe that every energy source needs to be part of the solution
1823798 obama himself voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure cheney played a major role in developing

1823809 allowing and or encouraging people to inject heroin into their veins is not harm reduction it is the opposite we believe it is a form of harm addition
1823810 i think its pretty embarrassing that he would attend an event that promotes the very things that he criticizes
1823811 he should not have showed up for the endorsement of the who document
1823812 safe injecting sites are not a new intervention but simply a repackaging of existing who recommended interventions such as needle exchanges etc
1823813 they enable known who recommended harm reduction interventions to be delivered and used in a safe environment with the aim of reaching the most marginalized and vulnerable of injecting drug users
1823814 i know women who live in the downtown eastside and who are alive now because of insite

1823817 for people who had no experience with computers macs were just easier to learn and use
1823818 and once we had the macs we began exploring other ways we could use them

1823820 from that point on we started building our own service bureau

1823840 barnes amp thornburg is cutting its summer associate program next year in its chicago office
1823841 you have to finish your studying almost 5 subjects today
1823842 i dont want the entirety of our taser program judged on one event

1823844 the taser is not the weapon of first resort for us
1823845 israeli orders are instructing land confiscation and the demolition of houses
1823846 israeli forces are setting a dangerous precedent by removing palestinians from their homes and emptying jerusalem of their presence the abu eisha house in beit hanina was comprised of five floors all of which were fully licensed except the last floor however israel used still this as an excuse to demolish the whole house
1823847 the demolished building was previously occupied by 10 families who are now homeless
1823848 israels intention is to judaize jerusalem and establish an israeli settlement on the ruins of the palestinian houses in silwan
1823849 israel makes it very difficult for palestinians to acquire building permits and the process costs them enormous sums of money up to 30 000 usd settlement activity and the targeting of palestinian existence have increased significantly since annapolis especially since the beginning of this year
1823850 israel issued the order to evacuate the house in sheikh jarrah and has threatened 27 other houses in the neighborhood in order to join israeli settlements
1823851 sheikh jarrah is near to the hebrew university and french hill
1823852 the plan is to isolate jerusalem from the ancient town of beit hanina where the shikh jarrah neighborhood is located thus linking the settlement of maaleh adumin with jerusalem
1823853 this issue is still ongoing today and we have witnessed a significant escalation in israeli attempts to take over districts of jerusalem
1823854 each person i talk to they go i knew it i knew it i knew it because they never received ashes
1823855 for these families its like reliving the death all over again
1823856 naturally i was upset im not sure what im going to do next
1823857 there are still a lot of unanswered questions were taking a look at
1823858 i would assume they prefer to deal with the boone county authorities rather than authorities from two different counties
1823859 my understanding is that this was not a surprise inspection
1823860 normally inspections are not planned with the owner but because of everything going on i think that one was done in conjunction with them
1823861 every time you focus you are meditating but give yourself some time to focus or meditate on your real self the illuminated intelligence that governs everything that is real meditation

1823865 parapsychology is not mentioned at all and i suspect that very few of the contributors would admit to the slightest sympathy with its claims
1823866 the conjuror is the human mind itself evolved by natural selection and the point has been to bolster human self confidence and self importance so as to increase the value we each place on our own and others lives
1823867 my feeling is its wishful thinking to posit a sort of silent minority of sympathisers in the scientific community i think that could grow but they will just need far better access to the data and a more balanced public debate ie less exposure for the dotty sceptics like randi
1823868 willis harman in his book global mind change sums it up better than i could
1823869 the basic stuff of the universe is matter energy we learn about reality from studying the measurable whatever consciousness is it emerges out of matter that is the brain when the the evolutionary process has progressed sufficiently far whatever we can learn about consciousness must ultimately be reconciled with the kind of knowledge we get from studying the physical brain for consciousness apart from a living physical organism is not only unknown it is inconceivable
1823870 the second metaphysic m 2 originally proposed by descartes harman describes as
1823871 dualistic there are two fundamentally different kinds of stuff in the universe matter energy stuff and mind spirit stuff matter energy stuff is studied with the present tools of science mind spirit stuff must be explored in other ways more appropriate to it
1823872 the ultimate stuff of the universe is consciousness mind or consciousness or spirit is primary and matter energy arises in some sense out of mind the physical world is to the greater mind as a dream image is to the individual mind ultimately the reality behind the phenomenal world is contacted not through the physical senses but through deep intuition consciousness is not the end product of evolution rather consciousness was here first
1823873 harman s thesis and it is one i propose to you is that science and consequently society as whole adopted m 1 as a basic metaphysical assumption over the period around copernicus gallileo newton and after holding to that world view for four hundred years society and science are now undergoing a mind change from m 1 to m 3
1823874 the fundamental change that we are suggesting is happening in western society can be put in terms of these metaphysics essentially it is a shift of the dominant metaphysic from m 1 to m 3 at first this may seem as outrageous a proposition as the heliocentric universe did to many in early seventeenth century europe m 3 seems quite foreign to the western mind or certainly would have a generation or two ago
1823875 a lot of the stuff physics is about these days is just as bizarre as psi blackholes times travel parallel universes etc a good example is david deutsch who deals with some pretty weird stuff as a quantum physicist but gets seriously hot under the collar at the mention of psi
1823876 once a critical mass of humanity recognizes the infinite depth of mans intuitive nature more and more will plumb those depths
1823877 not sure i agree that parapsychologists lack imagination sheldrake in particular has been innovative
1823878 the history of science is full with examples of theories which were supported by facts which could be emperically checked but still got denied just by sheer refusal because it didnt agree with the current paradigm
1823879 i think the main reason we have not progressed from m 1 to m 3 is the failures of parapsychology
1823880 not one not two emptyness is void of concepts both exist in my view free will and no free will non dualism and dualism
1823881 m 3 cant and wont come about as long as the majority of people in general are certain that absolute truth can eventually be arrived at through objective means
1823882 i spent most of my life under the communist regime which ignored and brutally violated human freedom and wanted to command not only the people but also the nature this experience taught me that freedom and rational dealing with the environment are indivisible
1823883 i do not see the future threats to free society coming from the old and old fashioned communist ideology in the past it was in the name of the masses or of the proletariat this time in the name of the planet structurally it is very similar
1823884 i see the current danger in environmentalism and especially in its strongest version climate alarmism
1823885 you may have heard earlier this month that global warming is now likely to take break for a decade or more there will be no more warming until 2015 perhaps later
1823886 less well known is that global temperatures have already been falling for a decade all of which means that by 2015 or 2020 when warming is expected to resume we will have had nearly 20 years of fairly steady cooling
1823887 last year for instance saw a drop in the global average temperature of nearly 0 7 degrees c the largest single year movement up or down since global temperature averages have been calculated despite advanced predictions that 2007 would be the warmest year on record made by such un associates as britains hadley centre a government climate research agency 2007 was the coolest year since at least 1993
1823888 according to the u s national climatic data center the average temperature of the global land surface in january 2008 was below the 20th century mean for the first time since 1982
1823889 also in january southern hemisphere sea ice coverage was at its greatest summer level january is summer in the southern hemisphere in the past 30 years
1823890 neither the 3 000 temperature buoys that float throughout the worlds oceans nor the eight nasa satellites that float above our atmosphere have recorded appreciable warming in the past six to eight years
1823891 even rajendra pachauri the head of the ipcc reluctantly admitted to reuters in january that there has been no warming so far in the 21st century
1823892 does this prove that global warming isnt happening that we can all go back to idling our suvs 24 7
1823893 sea ice in the arctic shrank to a record low last year if ice melts in the arctic that means its getting warmer
1823894 is it possible that it these eruptions part of an ongoing process have played a part in whatever melting there has been of the greenland and arctic ice sheets
1823895 scientists at noaas geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory have put together a chart showing arctic ice relatively stable until a precipitous decline began in 1999 the very year the arctic eruptions started
1823896 ladies and gentlemen of the jury everything that man said is bullshit
1823897 we can see then that there are fluctuations in global temperature a period of warming may be followed by a period of cooling and vice versa on this basis it is hard to accept the prognosis that because there was a warming trend from 1975 to 2000 this trend must inevitably continue
1823898 environmental scepticism is an elite driven reaction to global environmentalism organised by core actors within the conservative movement
1823899 self portrayal of sceptics as marginalised davids battling the powerful goliath of environmentalists and environmental scientists is a charade
1823900 sceptics are supported by politically powerful conservative think tanks funded by wealthy foundations and corporations
1823901 virtually all of the research since 1999 has been refuting the theory of human caused global warming
1823902 the delegation met wednesday with counterparts from europe and inhofe and many of his colleagues were shocked at the europeans refusal even to consider scientific research that casts doubt on predictions of cataclysmic warming
1823903 next time someone insists global warming isnt happening ask yourself where their views come from and whose interests they serve
1823904 im robert rosenkranz chairman of intelligence squared which is an initiative of the rosenkranz foundation
1823905 so let me just say a word about why were doing this
1823906 the topic tonight is one that has attracted an enormous amount of interest the proposition global warming is not a crisis
1823907 why this particular topic senator barbara boxer al gore have assured us that on this particular topic the debate is over well we took that as throwing down the gauntlet and i personally am cynical enough to think that perhaps theres a distinction between science and political science maybe a side that feels like there is nothing to debate might feel that there are perhaps some inconvenient truths on the other side that they would prefer not to deal with im old enough to remember when there was a scientific consensus on global cooling and this was in the 1970s with all kinds of alarmist data on that subject im enough of a businessman to know that the modeling and the use of the computer algorithms and forecasting the future is a very very difficult undertaking i mean if one could predict the weather or patterns of storms even a year in advance it would be worth billions and billions of dollars to people engaged in energy trading or insurance underwriting and a whole bunch of other pursuits and yet it cant really be effectively done so tonights debate i think is addressing issues that for me are very real and which at intelligence squared we feel can use some serious enlightenment first of all on the science of it does science really have the ability to tell us with a good degree of reliability what is going to happen to our climate over a hundred year period and secondly the economics this all leads in effect to public policies that say we should invest money now for benefits in the future well that always poses the traditional questions of well what are the costs what are the benefits what are the alternatives what are the risks of action what are the risks of inaction so there are a whole welter of economic aspects that i think hopefully tonight were going to get some enlightenment on as well
1823908 a form of dangerous heresy not far removed from treason
1823909 we have to believe the real scientists of the ipcc we must ignore the pseudo science of the non peer reviewed fossil fuel lobbyists and libertarian think tanks
1823910 is in the hands of climatologists and other related scientists who are highly motivated to look in one direction only because a large number of academic careers has evolved around the idea of man made global warming
1823911 the argument that agw must be real because it represents the majority opinion
1823912 outsiders posting minor potential problems that they have with global warming and acting as if they have dubunked the whole thing
1823913 pakistans biggest challenge is to reign in the isi as its involvement in incidents like the terrorist attack on the indian embassy in kabul are reasons enough for it to be reigned in
1823914 there has been political and military support to the taliban from outside over a long period now
1823915 though it is a month now since the kabul incident there has been no evidence connecting pakistan or the isi to the attack on the indian embassy
1823916 n o foi passado nada oficial para mim mas o presidente falou que tem uma proposta uma sondagem s acredito quando estiver l porque j tive decep es em neg cios anteriores mas n o fico iludido depois n o acontece e a gente se abala
1823917 estou muito chateado e n o vejo motivos para isso ter acontecido demorei bastante para ter a primeira oportunidade de jogar pelo clube e nunca reclamei publicamente al m disso fiz apenas quatro partidas e n o acredito que tenha dado nem tempo de ser avaliado de maneira justa
1823918 era muito querido no paran e deixei tudo de lado para jogar aqui tenho um carinho muito grande pelos meus companheiros pela torcida do inter e fico triste pelas coisas terem acontecido dessa maneira
1823919 violent incidents and casualties have declined and we have witnessed the improved performance of iraq security forces during a series of operations
1823920 the u n has been doing all it can to urge practical compromises
1823921 a failure to come to agreement on a law at this time would be a major setback not only for the prospects of elections this year but for the larger process of national reconciliation in iraq
1823922 they said that religious beliefs are more important than life more important than the prosperity of their familes even their mothers
1823923 im not afraid the truth is its pretty safe here its not like this sort of thing happens every day
1823924 starting from last year the east turkestan forces at home and abroad tried sabotage and violent activities targeting the beijing games
1823925 the east turkestan islamic movement and the east turkestan liberation organization are the two most active ones
1823926 the beijing games are our one last golden opportunity to inflict such attacks on china even though we know we are weak like an egg on a stone they will try to smear the stone
1823927 kashgar people of all ethnic groups are a strong foundation to combat east turkestan forces
1823928 we have a unitary ethnic environment and a very stable society
1823929 even a midnight people still have no problem strolling or jogging on the streets
1823930 for some minorities the conditions have been good but not for us
1823931 do you think people are happy here do you see them smiling dancing singing no because they have no work
1823932 why are people unhappy because power is in control of the communist party
1823933 there are a lot of uncertainties among children they have nothing to do on a daily basis school is out and since many of them experienced their schools collapsing most children are nervous about going back to school at all
1823934 moving forward helps them share those feelings with us and other children the children like it and their parents are happy for them to participate
1823935 it means add oil this is how children encourage each other to compete to keep going even the team that has already won keeps cheering on the other teams until they all finish
1823936 we have seen the impact of these activities on the children and the changes in their moods and behavior at first they were very nervous to be here now theyre more open and involved its like they forgot to be afraid
1823937 the children have a lot more energy than usual tonight
1823938 oh you can have a child until you are 45
1823939 im determined not to be one of those mawkish soppy mothers so im determined to be very busy plus its kind of exciting watching her go out there into the world
1823940 tomorrow is the first chance we get to see the results of all these offseason moves
1823941 the album is an initiative to support tibet the promotion of peace basic fundamental human rights including freedom of speech and religion and the current dalai lama tenzin gyatso
1823942 your dad and i have taken an impromptu trip to new york city
1823943 the 23 year old actress who plays georgiana the duchess of devonshire in period drama the duchess is
1823944 i think this debatte shows the real problem in investigating phenomena like veridical out of body experiences on the one hand there are believers trying to prove its autenticity on the other hand there are skeptics trying to debunk the experience
1823945 investments being made in those geographies will start showing results two to three years from now
1823946 we continue to focus on the markets in asia and we have also started in a preliminary way to look at some of the markets in latin america and the middle east
1823947 i expect this segment to continue to grow ahead of our companys average growth for some time to come
1823948 we have already started mock trading last week the spot exchanges are expected to be launched by the end of this month
1823949 we want to operate throughout the country but in the first phase we will concentrate on these five states
1823950 we have been consistently maintaining that the swing in prices are due to fundamental issues relating to demand and supply the futures trading helps the farmers in price recovery
1823951 there is no plan to extend the ban on futures trading of agricultural commodities
1823952 its good to see the market holding onto yesterdays gains cisco is probably responsible for much of the nasdaqs move
1823953 the fundamentals in these commodity related stocks are still pretty good it could be bargain hunting maybe its also a little more belief that the economic growth story is not completely over
1823954 i dont see much light at the end of the tunnel
1823955 i still think there will be more problems not only with fannie and freddie but also with a number of banks
1823956 some farmers may be holding marginal stocks but it does not add to big volumes with production falling in the last few years
1823957 the last day for trading of a contract shall be two working days prior to the final settlement day with the settlement price on the last trading day being the reserve banks reference rate on that date
1823958 the product was available in the over the counter space but with exchanges now able to launch it there will be greater transparency and price visibility besides smaller companies will also able to leverage it
1823959 we believe a lot of activity will take place in this market it would be a good hedging tool for indian corporates banks and corporates definitely stand to benefit we think just like bonds and derivatives the currency futures market will help further strengthen indian financial markets there would now be further transparency
1823960 however the gross open position of a trading member which is a bank across all contracts cannot exceed 15 of the total open interest or 100 million whichever is higher
1823961 for too long we have left out rural areas for expanding our mutual fund business the time the ripe to look towards rural belt for encouraging people in investing mutual funds
1823962 even if we can tap only 10 of the workers we could mobilize a huge amount of investments
1823963 after the inclusion in the formal banking system of so many rural workers the next step should be to educate them about investment decisions
1823964 while supply was easing demand was falling especially for metals linked to residential building activity such as aluminium extrusions and copper tube as the global economic downturn spread to the non residential sector and the motor industry was also being affected demand for other products was declining
1823965 we can take a lot of heart from winning despite the big guns not booming
1823966 theres a lot of expertise within the team there are five guys who have captained india so it will just be a case of coordinating the expertise thats already there
1823967 while upton would not comment on the playing surface only saying that he had not
1823968 traders are just booking profits ahead of the auction but the undertone continues to be bullish as traders believe that inflation may have peaked
1823969 the trend of a large number of deals happening this year is there
1823970 at a time when both debt and public equity are difficult to get private equity is becoming an interesting option for companies to consider
1823971 promoter expectations have become realistic when i compare the scenario now to say end of last year the difference is stark valuations seem to be fairer at this point
1823972 on conversion the issue will translate into an equity of 3 68 in the company
1823973 either ways it is not in the interest of the promoter conversion at lower price means dilution and repayment of debt would be a cash outflow
1823974 the promoter stake in the holding company is about 48
1823975 our objective was to make sure that we grow without diluting the stake in the holding company thats when we felt we could hive off our luxury textile business into a subsidiary and at some stage get an investor into it thats what weve done with reid amp taylor
1823976 the value of the land acquired is rs 620 crore
1823977 at the rate of 30 the two investors bring in rs 186 crore which will come into the spv in phases
1823978 we believe in partnership with funds we are transparent as far as our projects go this helps because investors come to trust your product and execution capabilities
1823979 i just want to get on the field and get going im 38 years old
1823980 did i wake up this morning and feel i should be at practice over there no i watched that scrimmage sunday night and it didnt seem so strange that i wasnt out there so maybe the writing was on the wall then
1823981 jeff garcia just walked through a gaunlet of reporters here and made quite a comment when one reporter joked that he was walking the green mile he responded by saying yeah dead man walking you get the feeling from that comment that garcia doesnt feel too good about the latest brett favre news
1823982 im going to be very reluctant to say much i dont want to have to repeat myself tomorrow and change my story
1823983 you can talk to brett yourself if we have permission im sure you do too
1823984 were creating a real drama here i dont know that its that tear jerking and emotional that we need to address it any more than we have
1823985 brett feels he needs to get into training camp hes ready to get started
1823986 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks jeffrey taylor u s attorney for the district of columbia told a news conference
1823987 we are now beginning the process of concluding this investigation once this process is complete we will formally close the case
1823988 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
1823989 ivins has claimed that he was suffering serious mental health issues in the months preceding the attacks and told a co worker that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behaviour
1823990 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1823991 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
1823992 on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and traditions

1823995 the real obama promises higher taxes more government spending so fewer jobs
1823996 renewable energy to transform our economy create jobs and energy independence thats john mccain
1823997 while senator mccain knows that senator obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle class families
1823998 a compelling positive storyline for yourself a less appealing one about your opponent
1823999 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically
1824000 he wants us to forget that hes fully embraced the bush policies he once opposed and bragged about supporting those policies more than 90 percent of time
1824001 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1824002 if bush wins this country is completely and totally lost
1824003 the way to win the war is to win the war

1824007 vote for me because the other guy is the antichrist
1824008 todays challenging economic environment suggests that the housing market is far from stabilizing
1824009 while we may be roughly half way through the eventual decline we are still in the early stages of realized defaults
1824010 most of the expected losses are yet to be realized
1824011 we have the wherewithal and the earning power to manage through this period
1824012 i dont think were at a point that the model doesnt work anymore
1824013 i think we are a point where the model is more stressed
1824014 i think virtually everyone including our critics would say that this would be an extremely ugly mortgage market if you didnt have the gses in it
1824015 with the goal of bringing down prices at the pump

1824042 the all party meeting was of the unanimous view that an environment must be created where the agitation could be suspended and the issues resolved through the process of dialogue
1824043 that either the same bomb makers built these ieds or that the people who made them were trained by the same experts
1824044 we are winding up in december and have started scaling down operations
1824045 it has been quite a successful programme we did not start with the objective of taking up the entire rehabilitation work we had an informal agreement with the government of tamil nadu to provide technical back up wherever possible and support the reconstruction and recovery efforts
1824046 we did a lot of pilot projects in various areas like livelihood rehabilitation education healthcare child safety water and sanitation and disaster preparedness and have introduced new technologies in these areas which have received a lot of positive response
1824047 there were issues later with temporary shelters water and sanitation but considering the scale of the damage it was only likely they cropped up
1824048 we have received a letter from governor vohra to visit the site we turn it down we have already made the sayss stand clear to the governor that nothing short of revocation of cancellation order and restoration of powers to the board will be acceptable
1824049 being a group of students and youth the simi is easily influenced by hardcore muslim terrorist organisations operating from jammu and kashmir the hizb ul mujahideen and the lashker e taiba have successfully penetrated into simi cadre to achieve their goals
1824050 i know what you are youre super fast really strong and so pale
1824051 the instrument was imported from a french manufacturer whose local representative was given the contract later when the local company was taken over by a us company the french manufacturer refused to continue service support
1824052 it is a big competition so it doesnt matter whether it is your first or third olympics everyone is trying to win and i am working equally hard for it at sydney i was new and didnt realise what it was at athens i was too serious and time just wasnt on my side after athens i almost quit
1824053 so it is a bonus for me here i am competing to fulfil my wish and passion maybe i am addicted to hard work and serious training just cant stay away from shooting whatever happens i am ready to accept happily
1824054 i too am dreaming about the elusive olympic medal but that is not the end of the world for me anymore
1824055 i dont want to think that way the day has to be yours whichever event you are shooting it is difficult to predict many world class shooters have failed to qualify for olympic finals and many olympic medallists have not been able to win any other competition it is altogether a different game
1824056 initially we had problem of ammunition and good infrastructure since i got the quota in 3p i was focusing more on it as good quality and barrel matching ammunition matter a lot as there were many competitions lined up to get air rifle quota for the other indian shooters i decided to practice only 3p

1824062 later this evening i intend to watch the video in question click the reply link above the box reserved for user comments and draft a response being careful to put as little thought into it as possible while making sure to use all capital letters and incorrect punctuation
1824063 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
1824064 the result will be an astonishing combination of ignorance offensiveness and sheer idiocy
1824065 it is my moral obligation to alert the internet community to the fact that this video is totally gay and furthermore that the individual who made it is a fag
1824066 after clicking the submit button i will immediately refresh the page so that i can view my own comment i will then notice that my comment has not appeared because the server has not yet processed my request become angry and confused and re post the same comment with unintentional variations on the original wording and misspellings creating two slightly different yet equally moronic comments
1824067 it is my hope that this will illustrate both my childlike level of impatience and my inability to replicate a simple string of letters and symbols 30 seconds after having composed it
1824068 once this minor diversion is complete i will finish posting my comment then sit there like the worthless human being i am and wait for other commenters to respond
1824069 because as i mentioned before i have nothing better to do with my life
1824070 we are blessed to be living in an age when we have a global communications network in which idiots assholes and total and complete wastes of fucking human life alike can come together to give instant feedback in an unfettered and unmonitored online environment
1824071 what better way to take advantage of this incredible technology than to log onto the internet and insult a complete stranger
1824072 brandons comments in particular contain a degree of unoriginality and stupidity that you only see in the most muttonheaded and imbecilic internet commenters
1824073 in fact ive seen him use at least a dozen variations of the word gay suffice it to say brandon mylenek is a truly stupid stupid idiot
1824074 you wanna play like that then well play like that rejuvination
1824075 you all listen now do ot interfere in this i will handle this myself
1824076 we gotta help you out here its the reason you called us here in the first place
1824077 youre refusing the help that will make your life last only a bit longer than it should
1824078 im tired of it im tired of all of it all of the bullshit everything everything stops here now do you understand ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1824079 it doesnt matter what you do or how much you do it
1824080 never did i think that you would be such a pesky opponent
1824081 i had no idea that youd be what you are when i first fought you and even now youre full of surprises however you dont have a big enough surprise to escape this battle with your life
1824082 let me explain myself you see my body is growing a resistance to your puny ass attacks eventually you wont even be able to hurt me

1824084 you wont get hurt if you stay out of this
1824085 fine dont flinch act like my attacks aint hurting you
1824086 i just said that clearly your attacks are losing effect but if you think otherwise im in no position to stop you from thinking that itll only make your demise much much easier
1824087 i think were gonna have to figure out which is the lesser of two evils
1824088 i think he has officially been taken to a point of no return or at least not an immediate return from this state once he finishes this guy my point is this i dont think nessasis will be in any form of a good state if we allow this battle to go down without doing damage to either the ultrasupremist or marko
1824089 so youre really saying that we should go in there and take down marko man
1824090 ever since he received the shin drive he just hasnt been the same maybe he needs a good ass kicking
1824091 make him even angrier the whole reason he decided to take the shin drive was because he was losing and he was losing because he wasnt at his ful legendary power you wanna beat him up because hes angry thatll only make him angrier
1824092 yeah calm marko down after losing a fight like this
1824093 its not like this is some kind of friendly fight this is serious shit he loses here i honestly dont know what the fuck to expect
1824094 i can not allow you to win this fight i have returned from the dead with a purpose and for me to return without having fulfilled that purpose is completely out of the question
1824095 im completely tired of all the bullshit all you evildoers know how to do is wreck a fucking party all you evildoers know how to do is kill kill and kill some more making life a living hell when its not supposed to be and even if it is who the hell are you to make it even worse no fuck you you wont kill me you cant kill me and you will die without fulfilling your little purpose you know whats worse the fact that the only reason this bullshit it happening is because this is nessasis beyond the bullshit known as the nessasis limits if i had your ass anywhere else in existence youre bitch ass would be dead and unwilling to come back to fight again every loss i ever had here is a fucking fluke i have no more respect for nessasis fuck this place fuck evil and most of all especially for the time being fuck you eeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
1824096 you can yell you can scream you can fire a beam
1824097 i have no time or brain power to waste on a nursery rhyme for your fucking ass
1824098 you see this is what the fuck im talking about how the fuck can i possibly lose to a loser like your bitch ass how the fuck can i let anything go wrong here because of fucking limitations you cant fucking hold me because i am marko man
1824099 n o poss vel afinal n o assinei nada nem consenti com isso como a telemar ia fazer isso sem meu consentimento meus dados e minha assinatura

1824104 everything is fine everything is fine slap in the face you are drunk bitch
1824105 for christ also suffered once for sins the righteous for the unrighteous that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison because they formerly did not obey when gods patience waited in the days of noah while the ark was being prepared in in which a few that is eight persons were brought safely through water baptism which corresponds to this now saves you not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to god for a good conscience through the resurrection of jesus christ who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of god with angels authorities and powers having been subjected to him
1824106 i am looking forward to working with lawrence mathis whom i have known since my days at broken bow
1824107 i believe that adam gregory has a tremendous upside in todays country format and i look forward to being on the team that takes his career to the next level
1824108 shelley brings a heightened level of enthusiasm to the adam gregory team and we look forward to benefiting from her infectious work ethic and spirit

1824110 cd baby has paid musicians more than 81 million over the past 10 years for cd and download sales it is one of the greatest tools created to allow musicians to make money from their music now artists can get manufacturing cd sales download sales and web hosting through cd babys hostbaby division seamlessly and more easily than ever
1824111 its amazing that this little hobby i started 10 years ago has benefited so many musicians disc makers was my first choice to take the company to new heights their operational expertise is just what little cd baby needed to grow up
1824112 the full extent of the law and the facts were presented in the courtroom hamdan is now considered a convicted war criminal and is no longer considered an enemy combatant and will be held separately from the other detainees at guantanamo because of his new status
1824113 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1824114 this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward
1824115 unlike sen barack obama who voted against the military commissions act and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
1824116 took several years of legal challenges to secure a conviction for material support for terrorism underscores the dangerous flaws in the administrations legal framework
1824117 its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice
1824118 and while it is important to convict anyone who provides material support for terrorism it is long past time to capture or kill osama bin laden and the terrorists who murdered nearly 3 000 americans
1824119 the verdict i think was in in this case long before the jury went out to deliberate
1824120 that is that the military commission system at guantanamo bay is deeply flawed that mr hamdan could not and did not receive a fair trial
1824121 we view the transaction as being supportive of our underperform rating on warner music
1824122 we believe it will be increasingly difficult to manage costs to limit margin contraction as revenue continues to decline

1824125 the executives narrow and strictly limited authority to settle international claims disputes pursuant to an executive agreement cannot stretch so far as to support the current presidential memorandum

1824138 computer networks and the internet are an indispensable part of the world economy but even as they provide extraordinary opportunities for legitimate commerce and communication they also provide extraordinary opportunities for criminals
1824139 as soon as we became aware that mr gonzalez was also working with criminals and getting them information we immediately took action
1824140 adam thought it would be really funny to get paris to respond to the john mccain ad that featured her
1824141 adam contacted paris directly and she agreed to do it he wrote the sketch and she really really loved it

1824159 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
1824160 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
1824161 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities

1824164 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
1824165 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
1824166 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
1824167 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
1824168 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
1824169 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
1824170 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
1824171 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
1824172 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
1824173 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
1824174 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
1824175 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
1824176 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
1824177 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
1824178 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
1824179 i had to wing it too but you were five and thought i knew everything
1824180 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection

1824185 wall street wont invest in these plants because they are too expensive and unreliable so senator mccain wants to shower the nuclear industry with billions of dollars of taxpayer handouts
1824186 the concept of a single repository overseas for smaller nations and those with nuclear power startups makes sense but not for the united states
1824187 but even if nuclear waste from commercial power plants were shipped elsewhere a u s repository would still be needed for highly radioactive waste generated by the military over the years peterson said
1824188 it is difficult for me to see sending those materials to an international repository
1824189 i think that stuff we really want to handle ourselves
1824190 now nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more that is why i am calling for an all of the above approach

1824194 this is the greatest challenge our country will face during our lifetimes it is a problem we will not solve in the next few years and it is likely to get progressively worse through the rest of this century we must not be selfish or timid if we hope to have a decent world for our children and grandchildren we simply must balance our demand for energy with our rapidly shrinking resources by acting now we can control our future instead of letting the future control us the most important thing about these proposals is that the alternative may be a national catastrophe further delay can affect our strength and our power as a nation he called the new energy policy he was proposing t he moral equivalent of war except that we will be uniting our efforts to build and not destroy

1824236 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1824237 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1824238 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1824239 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1824240 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1824241 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1824242 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1824243 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1824244 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1824245 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1824246 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1824247 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1824248 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous

1824252 in de nederlandse geschiedenis is bijna niets gebeurd dat enorm belangrijk was voor de huidige samenleving wat er aan geschiedenis vermeld wordt gebeurde vaak 300 400 jaar geleden als je kijkt naar duitsland naar de dingen die hier zijn gebeurd in de laatste 80 jaar die zijn nog altijd heel bepalend voor de samenleving van vandaag het contact tussen duitsers en hun eigen geschiedenis is veel belangrijker dan in nederland in berlijn zijn de laatste 100 jaar vijf verschillende regimes gepasseerd
1824253 in het begin ondervond ik veel moeilijkheden ik beheerste de taal toen helemaal niet en dat levert natuurlijk direct een grote achterstand op zonder dat ik het wou raakte ik sociaal uitgesloten puur en alleen al omdat ik mezelf absoluut niet kon uitdrukken van de ene dag op de andere besloot ik dan maar enkel nog duits te praten en mij zo de taal eigen te maken ondertussen versta ik zelfs de straattaal die hier heerst onder de jongeren
1824254 kreuzberg is een geweldig aangename stad om in te wonen het enige probleem dat je kan tegenkomen is het vinden van een gepaste baan de werkloosheid bedraagt in berlijn rond de 16 vooral in de academische sector daarom is het niet zo evident om een toekomst te hebben in berlijn aan de andere kant is berlijn perfect voor studenten omwille van de mooie appartementen die je kan huren voor bijna geen geld en je hebt er alles waar je maar van kan dromen
1824255 wat me zo aantrok aan berlijn was het fascinerende contrast tussen de moderne wijken in west berlijn en de andere wijken die laatste verkeren eigenlijk nog in dezelfde staat als vlak na de oorlog ook de mentaliteit hier trok me aan er zijn veel verschillen het was een stad die veel studenten artiesten en mensen met een alternatieve politiek gedachtegoed aantrok ik werd onmiddellijk verliefd op de stad en ben gebleven
1824256 voor de val van de muur was de stad een soort eiland in het midden van oost duitsland je botste constant op de muur deze wijk was er bijvoorbeeld vlakbij en eigenlijk werd die na een tijdje een deel van het landschap zoals een verkeersbord dat ook is

1824263 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1824264 marks the next step in our strategy to develop a significant platinum business and add further scale and diversification to our portfolio
1824265 xstrata believes that lonmins operations are attractive but that a significant transformation of operating and management practices is required to return lonmin to its former growth trajectory over time
1824266 xstratas offer reflects the operational weakness that lonmin has seen which has made lonmin vulnerable
1824267 the share price fell to a level which i think does significantly understate the value of those assets if they are run properly
1824268 xstrata is easily big enough they can afford to buy lonmin certainly
1824269 they talked a lot about different concepts in marketing and a lot of what they talked about is what you envision your business to be going forward
1824270 ive really seen that things werent progressing or looking the way id envisioned them to be

1824336 regardless of what happened to her she really fits the pattern of hundreds of others that amnesty international has documented where people disappeared and ended up in us custody
1824337 ive interviewed detainees who said there was a woman at bagram in 2003 and 2004
1824338 theres strong evidence to support the idea that there was a woman but no one ive spoken to knew who that woman was

1824340 i would say they the changes are fully responsive to the gaos direction but i would not consider this to be a substantial modification to the rfp

1824351 have agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran as part of this strategy
1824352 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran and its failure to meet the deadline set by the unscr 1803 the p5 1 are discussing the next steps in the unsc and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another sanction resolution
1824353 have agreed that while informal contacts between mr solana and mr iranian negotiator saeed jalili will continue we now have no choice but to pursue further sanctions against iran as part of our dual track strategy
1824354 our objective is not sanctions for the sake of sanctions
1824355 we have to resort to the security council sanctions if we dont see theres any possibility to enter into a dialogue
1824356 but we are getting closer to the point where we will make that determination
1824357 if iran does not choose this path the un security council will be referred to once again
1824358 we would have preferred a clear yes but it is more complicated than that
1824359 we certainly do not believe that it is a foregone conclusion that it the dialogue is not going to be successful

1824363 the president of the republic understands the reasons that led the dalai lama considering the present circumstances not to request a meeting during his stay in france in august
1824364 no such meeting is planned and we have not asked for such a meeting
1824365 some people in our two countries wondered recently about the reality and sense of this friendship
1824366 my presence in beijing will confirm it once more the friendship between france and china is a fundamental axis of frances foreign policy
1824367 i feel very excited and very proud because the olympic games is a 100 year dream of chinas

1824397 the connor campaign did not conduct the push poll that many of our supporters in brooklyn report receving this weekend push polls are unethical and and insulting to the public that they mislead i am surprised anyone would suspect our campaign of conducting such a poll when its primary messages were all negative towards senator marty connor surely we would not conduct a push poll with the primary purpose of negatively influencing the publics perception of our candidate since john chromzaks campaign has already stated they did not conduct the poll this begs the following question in a two way race whose interest is it in to conduct a negative push poll about marty connor senator connor or his opponent

1824413 one reason for brazils success is the sound regulation of its leasing industry we expect more growth in the future but predict the rate will slow starting in 2008 and 2009 a large percentage of brazils leasing portfolios are concentrated in motor vehicles and that market seems to be reaching its saturation point high prices especially high oil prices may also have an impact

1824554 als deze skeletten slechts voor een bepaald publiek worden gehouden wordt het maar snobistisch het zou nogal decadent zijn maar gebeurt helaas wel vooral met kleinere fossielen omdat deze beter bereik en verspreidbaar zijn maar daarbij kan men geen garantie van echtheid bieden dus er zijn veel vervalsingen op de markt
1824555 wij bezitten zowel afgietsels als originelen alle twintig iguanadons die we tentoonstellen zijn echt wij hebben hen dan ook zelf opgegraven in de mijngroeven van bernissant de andere grote skeletten zijn vaak volledig gereconstrueerd uit afgietsels maar dat maakt hen niet minder echt
1824556 dat men de boeren in china betaalt voor gevonden fossielen is puur vraag en aanbod nieuwe fossielen onthullen vaak nieuwe dingen en de waarde van zon vondst hangt af van hun kwaliteit zo bezit ons museum het afgietsel van een uniek t rex skelet hij behoort tot de bekendste skeletten ter wereld gezien hij n van de enige is waarvan de buikribben nog intact zijn
1824557 de totale waarde van onze collectie is nooit echt geschat het betreft namelijk een collectie op wereldniveau maar gezien onze skeletten staatseigendom zijn worden deze nooit te koop aangeboden wij verkopen enkel de afgietsels van onze iguanadons en hebben deze ook al eens uitgeleend aan japan maar toen werden zij slechts voor een fictief bedrag verzekerd

1824559 de zaal van de dinosauri rs is en blijft een hit alleen al het eerste weekend dat gratis bezocht kon worden kwamen hier 18 000 bezoekers over de vloer dit aantal nam sindsdien enkel toe reeds 270 000 bezoekers zijn hier al sinds november langsgekomen wat enorm is als je weet dat we per jaar maar 250 000 tot 300 000 bezoekers ontvangen
1824560 waarom hebben wij ons door de hype laten overtuigen om hier toch naar te komen kijken

1824765 i am lucky enough to get to the studio from mid day until midnight so after that all day i dont feel the need to walk around with an ipod
1824766 i also paint and do prints for the last two lone swordsmen album all the artwork was mine

1824772 when i was 12 years old there was a 50s rock n roll revival going on in europe
1824773 i was bombarded by images of 50s clothing from a very early age
1824774 ive always loved 40s and 50s films its a classic yet timeless style
1824775 theres always an element from the 50s in any other time in clothing fashions throughout the years
1824776 i like it because the style looks slightly removed and like it has come from a parallel universe
1824777 in 50s noir films they have a weird otherworldly ghostly quality
1824778 i have a tailor who makes me stuff i take him a picture or an original that is falling apart and he does copies of originals for me
1824779 as soon as i got here i found a really nice vintage shop near the hotel and i found an early 50s kind of western wind cheater and a 1950s shirt

1824874 developing a strong artistic visual identity is so important for any big initiative like this to unite the community in action and to target emotional connections
1824875 modburys plastic bag free initiative is so successful influential and impactful in part because rebecca realized the importance of developing a strong graphic design identity for the reusable bags putting a refreshingly positive spin on boycotting plastic alternatives
1824876 we specialize in getting these kinds of eco sustainable initiatives and companies noticed positioning them to achieve their goals with smart branding identities advertising websites and other collateral material
1824877 we also dig deep to find the greenest resources and design options for businesses organizations and communities that want to show their commitment to the future
1824878 in kind indirect tax fee or charge on new development
1824879 it will have far reaching and negative impacts on local governments ability to regulate land use to protect people their property and their quality of life the clearing and grading ordinance is based on scientific data that clearly shows negative impacts on peoples well water rivers and streams and neighboring properties from excessive clearing
1824880 the science is clear excessive forest destruction harms our lakes streams and drinking water king county has both a legal and a moral obligation to our citizens to protect our environment economy and quality of life the appellate courts ruling undermines our ability to meet that obligation and threatens essential land use protections across the state
1824881 the county executive officer promoted the cao as necessary to address environmental concerns in king county but the countys own report released before the cao was passed contradicted this contention
1824882 loss of forest cover and net loss of wetland in king county has slowed to a standstill rural and forest areas remain relatively undeveloped and continue to provide habitat for fish and wildlife and protect surface water flows streams and habitat in our rural areas are still of high quality
1824883 in short the report demonstrated that the land use regulations already in force sufficiently protect the environment health and safety of the public and that the additional restrictions in the caos land clearing regulations were unnecessary
1824884 ron sims has the right to petition for review we think the court of appeals decision was very direct and the right decision
1824885 lets assume the scientific data is true the ordinance is still unlawful it is applied to all properties regardless of individual circumstances
1824886 ron sims has been going around telling people the law is still on the books but it has been declared unlawful if the county continues to enforce it it will open itself up to more lawsuits and potential damages this time the highest reviewing court found the regulations unlawful we are monitoring to see that the county is not enforcing them
1824887 by his own estimation ron has somewhere over a 70 million budget shortfall going into 2009 and hes going to spend significant resources challenging a decision that he lost 3 to 0 on every single point hes wasting taxpayer money
1824888 as a citizen i really hope that people will hold king countys feet to the fire on this one i hope people question sims fiscal responsibility it is costly to take a case to the supreme court particularly at a time when critical county services are being cut for lack of money when prosecutors ranks are being thinned when the countys tb immunization program could be in jeopardy when the sheriffs office is facing deep cuts
1824889 the revised site plan would need to show a no build easement that would protect the tree from any future construction

1824891 for me superleague formula is a dream come true joining motor racing and football the two sports that i love the most
1824892 knowing that my racing team will run in the colors of my club and to be able to share this challenge with my friend francesco totti is just fantastic
1824893 when giancarlo called me to confirm that i would be the as roma race car driver i couldnt believe it
1824894 me and giancarlo have always been friends and have always shared the same strong passion towards motorsport as roma is the team i love the most and i usually follow most of their matches on tv now the players will be supporting me that is incredible
1824895 having as roma and giancarolos race team join our championship is going to be fantastic for the italian fans
1824896 about sunny ruthchild former owner of gardens and sunspaces gallery which is now the grange cafe and how she painted hopscotch diagrams on the sidewalks and the city sued her she came to so much grief over it and now they are going to tear up the sidewalks then it hit me we should invite everyone down to main street to paint the sidewalks
1824897 this may be the one time you can do something that ordinarily you arent supposed to do and have a great time doing it knowing that the sidewalks will be torn up anyway
1824898 we are hoping for a lot of adult involvement and not just the children it will be fun
1824899 im still not quite sure how i was chosen to do this but i think it had to do with a performance tour i did in 2001 i took a group of uw alumni and students past and then current marching band members to china and we played at beijing university for 4 000 people among them were many officials of the school and of the chinese army band i guess we must have impressed the right people
1824900 it met and exceeded all my expectations thats why i know that those who are participating this year will have some incredible and unforgettable cultural social and musical experiences
1824901 when i signed up to go it seemed like such a distant thing
1824902 but now its almost here and its hard to believe that im going i am so excited to get to go to the olympics and china at the same time thatll be hard to beat i think
1824903 were playing somewhere different each day and of course were going to do a lot of sightseeing too were even going to shanghai to perform
1824904 being in a band has been such a great experience for me
1824905 ive met so many people and made numerous friends as a result of my participation and ive gotten the opportunity to travel too going to china and having the chance to perform at the olympics well it cant get better than that
1824906 i havent met or rehearsed with the other two thirds of the orchestra and when i do ill only have two days to get it all together before our first performance
1824907 m assing in chicago was the worst strategic mistake the antiwar movement could make
1824908 the bible does not address the matter of appropriate behaviour for those who are for whatever reason homosexual by instinct or nature
1824909 by the end of the 80s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognise as homosexual by nature
1824910 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had the about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
1824911 the church has shifted its stance on several matters notably the rightness of lending money at interest and the moral admissibility of contraception so i am bound to ask if this is another such issue

1824926 its very clear what we are talking about is a network and woodinville is part of that network
1824927 my amendment did not pass and i could not support the overall plan
1824928 my personal opinion is that given the poor state of the economy this is not the time to ask voters for a big tax increase especially since the tax doesnt respond to the demand for bus service we see right now
1824929 king county metro transit now serves a record 400 000 riders per day which is more than sound transit will serve when this proposal is fully implemented in 15 years i want an integrated transportation system that conveniently moves as many people as we can as soon as we can
1824930 in 1968 the voters of this region decided against building a rail transit system if we had supported that ballot measure the system would have opened in 1985 and the bonds would have been paid off last year we would be having a much different discussion right now we need to learn from history and take action to expand mass transit
1824931 completing a 53 mile light rail system will forever move our region beyond a car and bus only paradigm
1824932 the transportation debate in this region has been all talk an no action leaving us stuck in congestion choking on fumes this plan gives voters the opportunity to glide past congestion with fast frequent comfortable reliable and environmentally friendly transit alternatives
1824933 this plan gets light rail to redmond seven years sooner than last years plan
1824934 and it significantly increases bus service within the next four years locally that will help us manage our growth effectively it will also help the entire regions economy when companies decide where to locate or expand they look hard at how their employees will be able to get around we need to catch up with the regions we compete against both nationally and globally
1824935 the rapid ridership growth sound transit is seeing truly shows that if we build it they will come this junes sounder ridership numbers showed a 44 percent ridership growth on the north line over only a year ago increasing access to fast reliable transit options will give snohomish county commuters a way out of traffic jams

1824937 joe is coming to the city at an exciting and integral time in bothells history when having a cohesive team working at its peak is vital with joes hire our executive level team is fully staffed and i look forward to having his talent in bothell

1824939 i enjoy municipal law and am prepared for this new professional challenge i am eager to delve into the citys projects programs and issues at hand to provide quality legal services to the city and the bothell community
1824940 were talking about supplying essential tools to children for whom education means everything including a way out of the poverty cycle
1824941 the children are thrilled to receive the supplies because it means they can better fit in with their classmates and be confident theyll have what they need to get their work done
1824942 most of us grow up with pencils paper art supplies dictionaries and such at home so we take those things for granted but thats definitely not the case for the children in the families that hopelink serves
1824943 it is no longer a question of if but a matter of when
1824944 these firefighters are community heroes and provide invaluable emergency services for the army and area residents
1824945 im proud land transfer was approved so that these hard working men and women can continue to save lives help those in danger and enhance national security this is a win win situation for bothell and the army
1824946 were very pleased to have this land conveyance be completed
1824947 next up we will be working to replace the existing queensborough firehouse built in 1979 for volunteer use with a new and expanded facility its all still in the planning stages but when its done we anticipate staffing it 24 hours a day seven days per week with additional staff members and equipment these improvements will increase the safety of the residents of southeast snohomish county by decreasing response times to emergency calls the new firehouse will be an asset that the community can use for years to come

1824951 maximalist initiatives on the ground at the negotiating table and in their public statements
1824952 we will make every effort we will do our utmost to go the way of solving the karabakh issue
1824953 the nagorno karabakh conflict must be solved within the framework of azerbaijans territorial integrity the specification of status is a different matter the principles of territorial integrity and status do not contradict each other the same happens in georgia and moldova
1824954 we attach special importance to the settlement of the karabakh issue and constantly hold discussions with the nagorno karabakh republics leadership regarding the settlement process
1824955 neither today nor tomorrow armenias authorities will take steps that would encourage the denial of the armenian genocide
1824956 we hope that the initiative will also evoke turkeys positive response
1824957 when people ask me about my trip in armenia and about the situation with the protest i dont want to be the kind of person who says well i stayed at home
1824958 under article 49 of the constitution the president of the republic is the guarantor of the constitution and ensures normal activities of the legislative executive and judicial authorities and this means that the president is personally responsible for the work of all state structures
1824959 there is no sign yet that he has the intention to do away with that highly corrupt system and put the state to the service of the loftiest aims of developing the country and ensuring the welfare of its people
1824960 beginning today the main motto of the movement is serzh sargsyans resignation and holding of early presidential elections
1824961 i really appreciate jeff moorad and tom garfinkel co owners of hall of fame racing for giving me this opportunity
1824962 i have really enjoyed my time testing with the people on the team and im looking forward to having a successful weekend at michigan in the dlp hdtv toyota and helping hall of fame racing finish out the season as strong as possible
1824963 it is apparent that turkey brings forth several preconditions for normalizing relations with armenia and these preconditions include the withdrawal of armenian troops from mountainous nagorno karabagh and armenias rejection of the policy of genocide recognition but it is clear that armenia cannot meet these preconditions
1824964 this results in armenias formal view that mutual relations with turkey must be established without any preconditions
1824965 armenias newly elected president serge sarkisians invitation has caused broad discussions also in armenia
1824966 but considering the fact that armenia still is under the post election crisis which followed this years presidential elections and that this situation influences the foreign policy of armenias leadership it is fairly difficult to predict how beneficial this invitation will be for bettering armenian turkish relations and to know sarkisians true motives behind this invitation
1824967 a new phase of dialogue with the government and people of turkey
1824968 a large majority 76 percent believed relations with turkey must be established but without forgetting the past or the recognition of the genocide while the other group was completely against the establishment of any relations
1824969 i believe that the eu can play a greater role in assisting reduce tensions in and around nagorno karabakh when the chairmanship of the current french representative ends i would recommend that the french minsk group position be handed over to an eu representative
1824970 but on the other hand it makes no sense to expect that a solution to the nk conflict is going to be come from the outside azerbaijan and armenia their political leadership and their people will eventually need to agree to a compromise this will only happen when they come to the conclusion that compromise is better than more fighting
1824971 i still believe that the current formula on the table is the best one possible return of seven occupied districts to nk full withdrawal by forces from armenia refugee idp return to all areas including nk normalization of the situation determination of nks ultimately status postponed until all people can participate fully in a democratic process once withdrawal begins and refugee return starts the deadlock in the negotiations process will be broken and tensions diminish

1825045 you are probably going to have to screen millions of compounds and you cant screen millions of infected mice
1825046 so our approach was to find an alternative host that could be infected with human pathogens which was small enough and cheap enough to be used in drug screens whats remarkable is that many common human pathogens including staphylococcus and pseudomonas will cause intestinal infection and kill the worms so now you can look for a compound that cures it that prevents the pathogen from killing the host
1825047 bacteria dont want to alert their host that they are there by immediately producing virulence factors which the host would recognize

1825118 i dont know why youre thinking im selling cirque du soleil to the world im not selling cirque du soleil im giving up 20 per cent of the company
1825119 cirque du soleil represents the ideal platform for istithmar world to fuse its strong investment network into a highly focused and dynamic institution with tremendous scope for growth across markets
1825120 i would not do a transaction like that if i did not believe it will have a beneficial result for the community that i have been living in
1825121 greyhound knows how important it is to get these removed and we are doing everything possible
1825122 this is something that we immediately asked to be done last week realizing that these could be offensive
1825123 the good news for boeing is that it is a genuine opportunity
1825124 at this point it is a fair bet that politicians are going to start meddling in the selection process
1825125 why did it take me so long to accept my body
1825126 that intersection has flooded all my life but with the new drainage project kicked in it didnt flood
1825127 in terms of feedstock we do have a supply of crude in tanks that will enable us to continue running for the foreseeable future
1825128 we had very little rain and a breeze of 5 to 10 mph
1825129 weve had worse thunderstorms than this like the squall that came through sunday night
1825130 i have come to the conclusion that one useless man is a disgrace two are a law firm and three or more are called a congress
1825131 just 12 of voters think congress has passed any legislation to improve life in this country over the past six months
1825132 the president has made this a key part of his legacy
1825133 people are just cruel this is bad karma for him
1825134 because she was out clubbing and its on early in the morning so she was probably just rollin home
1825135 the trucking profession has become sweatshops on wheels because of the excessive and unsafe hours of work and driving time required of truck drivers
1825136 prevent driver fatigue ensure safe and efficient motor carrier operations an save lives
1825137 employment in the information industry declined by 13 000 in july and by 44 000 over the past 12 months telecommunications lost 5 000 jobs in july
1825138 there was a slight increase in demand for web 2 0 technology six to eight months ago but that atrophied as the economy slowed down
1825139 quentin is convinced britney will be brilliant shes delighted she thinks it could turn her career around link

1825142 it puts you in this perpetual loop so your only options are to kill your browser session or be brow beaten into installing it
1825143 malicious attackers have been building so much confidence in this risk forwarding process of hosting their campaigns that they would start actively spamming the links residing within low profile legitimate sites across the web
1825144 do not download flash player from a site other than adobe com
1825145 looked at it and probably agreed with some of the arguments that were made public
1825146 it means that right when you thought you were out of the woods you are not
1825147 we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love
1825148 one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme
1825149 that was probably the most important step internally as well as externally to say thatwe screwed up
1825150 in their post event examination they identified that there was at least some problems with former leadership at mobileme
1825151 eddy has shown with itunes over the years that hes very good at running a 24 7 worldwide distribution point hes got some serious chops and the appointment is interesting
1825152 i think apple may have to consider broadly beta testing with services in thecloud like mobileme
1825153 for apple both strategically and tactically a lot of the sizzle would get shown in a beta
1825154 that would take a certain tool out of their kit their ability to maintain secrecy around a product launch
1825155 people say this is even better than all the rumors
1825156 they wont do this on hardware or the os but maybe on these internet related services they will
1825157 i give it less than a 50 50 chance of happening

1825200 thus far the preliminary process has been more about making a public spectacle and media headlines than the actual law there is no need to further participate in a process that has been about attempting to change public opinion and affect the jury pool the process we are undertaking will help us address the legal matters at hand in a more timely fashion in circuit court it is long overdue for us to get serious about the actual legal matters at hand as a result we have decided to waive our right to a preliminary examination the constitution guarantees every american the right to due process and a fair trial we are confident that given those rights the mayor will be vindicated

1825212 you push straight ahead and it just comes back at you from the sides
1825213 we have a full spectrum of tools to use from lethal to non lethal right now
1825214 but none of that can happen until we get this security situation under control theres a thousand different ways we can use the lessons weve learned in the last five years of war but these bombings have got to stop were not a bunch of farmers were in control of our own destiny
1825215 you could drive a car through here or even a truck and wed never see it
1825216 the state does not decide how many athletes go those who qualify go no athlete who has met the qualifying standard has been left behind
1825217 there is an upward trend but of course there are countries in the region such as brazil cuba and venezuela where more support is given
1825218 those who qualify are sent not those who have money
1825219 most of the money in high performance sports is spent in dollars because it is used for international flights and competitions rather than an increase there has been an update
1825220 has a sports policy but what it lacks is the political will to really support sports such as a plan to spend 100 or 200 million dollars a year for four to eight years
1825221 apart from football most federations are amateur so they are managed by volunteers who may or may not have a track record in the sport they carry out their duties after their paid jobs and they do what they can usually without much aptitude
1825222 nowadays sports need marketing and publicity and therefore sports managers
1825223 in europe players earn at least five times what they earn here so its logical that they want to leave but its a pity because stars who are role models for the youngest players go and trainers also leave
1825224 the level of sports secretariat support is low i receive 450 pesos 150 dollars a month and i have to support a wife and daughter next year ill have to start boxing professionally
1825225 there has been less travel to competitions which has meant fewer opportunities for boxers to build experience
1825226 argentina has a great olympic boxing tradition but in the past the athletes would go to the games when they were 26 with 150 fights behind them in contrast nowadays an 18 year old boxer who has won two or three fights is already lured into a professional career

1825232 anthropologists stress that there are as many standards of humanity as there are different ways of being human and that there are no grounds apart from sheer prejudice for investing any one set of standards with universal authority
1825233 in particular the world conference stresses the importance of working towards the elimination of violence against women in public and private life and the eradication of any conflicts which may arise between the rights of women and the harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices
1825234 treatment has been held by the court to be inhuman because inter alia it was premeditated was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering and also degrading because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear anguish and inferirity capable of humiliating and debasing them in order for a punishment or treatment associated with it to be inhuman and degrading the suffering or humiliation involved must in any event go beyond that inevitable element of suffering or humiliation connected with a given form of legitimate treatment or punishment the question whether the purpose of the treatment was to humiliate or debase the victim is a further factor to be taken into account but the absence of any such purpose cannot conclusively rule out a finding of a violation of article 3
1825235 the extremely painful physically invasive psychologically damaging and permanently disfiguring process of genital mutilation undoubtedly rises to the level of persecution
1825236 must be considered a continuing harm that renders a petitioner eligible for asylum without more
1825237 female genital mutilation is not simply an isolated act of violence but rather a form of gender persecution practiced to overcome sexual characteristics of young women
1825238 as much as subsidies and welfare programs are important sexlessness is also a critical issue in this problem
1825239 when we set out to design pennies we wanted a simple solution for personal budget tracking many of the other apps out there emphasize inputting a lot of information and other details when youre on the go and making a purchase though we think that its best to offer a really simple interaction with built in categories that takes seconds to enter an expense

1825245 the research uncovered a previously unknown link between the energy machinery of the nostoc bacterium and its core nitrogen metabolism further investigation of this pathway might lead to understanding and improvement of the hydrogen production mechanism of these bacteria it will certainly be some time before a pool of bacteria powers your car but this research is yet another small step towards sustainable fuels
1825246 the next step for us will be further investigation into hydrogen production as well as constructing more mathematical models capable of integrating various sources of biological data
1825247 we have found a dictionary of genes critical to a viral infection using these techniques this can be done with any virus
1825248 it might be possible to find a pan flavivirus target
1825249 this technique is a clean probe of the microscopics in this system and it allows us to see interesting things like a very large energy gap that seems to appear before the superfluid state
1825250 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
1825251 this strategy opens up exciting new engineering design possibilities by eliminating the two dimensional planar constraints of conventional semiconductor wafer based optoelectronics
1825252 mechanics helps to reduce the stresses and strain in components and guide and optimize the system design
1825253 we believe that some of the most compelling areas of future application involve the intimate conformal integration of electronics with the human body in ways that are inconceivable using established technologies
1825254 we are working actively with collaborators to explore possibilities in advanced health monitors prosthetic devices and therapeutic systems national science foundation
1825255 in previous simulations this region came out smooth but now we have enough detail to see clumps of dark matter
1825256 some of those clumps are so dense they will emit a lot of gamma rays if there is dark matter annihilation and it might easily be detected by glast
1825257 there are several candidate particles for cold dark matter and our predictions for glast depend on the assumed particle type and its properties
1825258 for typical wimps anywhere from a handful to a few dozen clear signals should stand out from the gamma ray background after two years of observations that would be a big discovery for glast
1825259 it simulates the dark matter distribution from near the time of the big bang until the present epoch so practically the entire age of the universe and focuses on resolving the halo around a galaxy like the milky way
1825260 we see a lot of substructure even in the inner part of the halo where the solar system is
1825261 every substructure has its own sub substructure and so on there are lumps on all scales
1825262 we can make comparisons with the dwarf galaxies and stellar streams associated with the milky way the appearance of these stellar systems is closely linked to the substructure of the dark matter halo

1825264 one of the most noticeable consequences of climate change in the uk is the frequency of mild winters as a direct result of this aphids seeking new sources of food are appearing significantly earlier in the year and in significantly higher numbers we have been studying the seasonal biology of aphids for a long time now and we know that populations can continue to grow over the winter and spring provided that conditions are warm enough after a warm winter there are much larger numbers flying and they are hence detected much earlier this means that there are more aphids flying in spring and early summer when crops are particularly vulnerable to damage
1825265 environmental change is one of the big challenges facing the world today these long term data on the seasonal appearance of flying aphids not only show that there are already noticeable changes in the uk

1825282 conformally wrapping surfaces with stretchable sheets of optoelectronics provides a practical route for integrating well developed planar device technologies onto complex curvilinear objects
1825283 this approach allows us to put electronics in places where we couldnt before
1825284 we can now for the first time move device design beyond the flatland constraints of conventional wafer based systems
1825285 optics simulations and imaging studies show that these systems provide a much broader field of view improved illumination uniformity and fewer aberrations than flat cameras with similar imaging lenses
1825286 hemispherical detector arrays are also much better suited for use as retinal implants than flat detectors
1825287 the ability to wrap high quality silicon devices onto complex surfaces and biological tissues adds very interesting and powerful capabilities to electronic and optoelectronic device design with many new application possibilities

1825289 the effects of todays rough economy can certainly be felt on most everyones pocketbook
1825290 when trimming grocery lists or school meal plans to save money its important to remember the nutritional and economic value that nutrient rich foods like milk provide for our children milk cheese and yogurt are especially critical for growing children as they contain a unique combination of nine essential nutrients critical for bone health and development
1825291 interactions of s aureus with fibronectin were first reported more than 30 years ago and yet we still dont understand precisely how and why the bacteria target this human protein
1825292 our studies provide a significant step toward solving that issue and could help the future development of new treatments for rare but serious conditions such as infective endocarditis an infection of the lining or valves of the heart
1825293 our results strongly suggest that the reason that some children who have been given antibiotics appear to develop asthma is because they had a chest infection and the symptoms of the chest infection in young children can be confused with the start of asthma
1825294 antibiotics are given to treat the respiratory condition and rather than being a cause of asthma as has been previously suggested they are used for chest infections which can indicate an increased risk of asthma or be mistaken for it
1825295 our data still leaves open the possibility that antibiotics may affect the development of eczema and itchy skin by four years and allergic hypersensitivity by 15 months
1825296 what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
1825297 the advantages of curved detector surface imaging have been understood by optics designers for a long time and by biologists for an even longer time
1825298 thats how the human eye works using the curved surface at the back of the eye to capture an image
1825299 in a conventional planar camera parts of the images that fall at the edges of the fields of view are typically not imaged well using simple optics
1825300 the hemisphere layout of the electronic eye eliminates this and other limitations thereby providing improved imaging characteristics
1825301 there is a lot of room for improvement but early tests show how well this works we believe that this is scalable in a straightforward way to more sophisticated imaging electronics
1825302 it has been a very good collaboration between the two groups

1825309 experts continue to disagree on some issues but critical questions have been answered the consensus among scholars is that the bomb was not needed to avoid an invasion of japan and to end the war within a relatively short time it is clear that alternatives to the bomb existed and that truman and his advisers knew it
1825310 it is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at hiroshima and nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against japan the japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender
1825311 japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary and no longer mandatory as a measure to save american lives
1825312 p m churchill amp i ate alone discussed manhattan it is a success decided to tell stalin about it stalin had told p m of telegram from jap emperor asking for peace
1825313 should the emperor system be abolished they the japanese people would lose all reason for existence unconditional surrender therefore means death to the hundred million it leaves us no choice but to go on fighting to the last man

1825332 from past experience we know that announcements concerning future changes can have a dramatic effect on the market we need an announcement now as the last thing consumers need is even more uncertainty

1825336 know that the lord is god it is he who made us and we are his
1825337 but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us
1825338 just think if jesus had lived the rest of mankind would have died god sent his son to die for us so that we can be spared form the eternal death we deserve and instead receive eternal life
1825339 god tested abraham in asking him to sacrifice his only son isaac not to trip him and watch him fall but to deepen his capacity to obey god and thus develop his character
1825340 but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation a people belonging to god that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light
1825341 gods workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works

1825343 as the order is on back order we have done store credit for you thank you sorry about the inconvenience
1825344 hes deceptively fast and hes played great hes really such a professional we played against him for a bunch of years he really explodes through tackles and it seems likes hes always falling forward which is great for a back
1825345 i just had to read the offensive line and see how the defense was slanting
1825346 then it was just making one cut and getting into the open field
1825347 we were balanced there are many things we can do better hopefully we can build on this win with a short week preparing for the browns
1825348 i just tried to throw it as high as i can
1825349 i tried to throw it into the third row in the stands he just jumped up and grabbed it he has a great leaping ability and hes got a great timing on it he has a great sense when the ball is coming
1825350 hes a really tough guy maybe hes a little undersized 5 foot 9 185 pounds but you dont expect him to be as strong as he is hes a strong guy and has a lot of heart

1825354 we saw sales fall sharply in 2006 as speculators continued to dry up borrowing costs rose and a growing number of would be buyers decided to watch from the sidelines hoping for prices to drop as the inventory of homes for sale grew
1825355 we have seen a bit of a rebound in terms of activity
1825356 we are estimating 3 percent to 5 percent in overall appreciation with sales activity up significantly over last year we expect a more normal housing market
1825357 sellers are more realistic and more buyers are stepping up to the plate
1825358 i felt my job at that point was to deliver the mail
1825359 the family of this puppy allowed him to continue to care for their other dog through may of 2008 and this happened in november 2006
1825360 the veterinarian said it would take the force of being struck by a car to kill this animal
1825361 and it was coming from inside the residence hess said
1825362 were crowing the whole time we were there were taken to the humane league of lancaster county where they will be cared for pending the outcome of the court case
1825363 wasnt dirty and the birds seem to be fine they were in good sized cages
1825364 colon had a prior felony drug conviction so it was appropriate considering the guidelines and the facts of the case
1825365 this case will send a message that animal fighting will not be tolerated in this county
1825366 it significantly elevates a hormone called catecholamines and these are important messengers to tell the cells to burn fat
1825367 perhaps the reality is that paris has a more substantive energy plan than barack obama
1825368 this is beyond the wheels coming off of the meat supply system
1825369 its the entire train in a tangled heap and the people caught in the train wreck are you and me and all of our neighbors when reports say that there is a one in 400 chance that the package of ground beef you pick up at the supermarket will be tainted with a lethal bacterium the food safety system is no longer functioning and immediate radical steps must be taken
1825370 there are many theories as to why there has been such an unprecedented jump in e coli
1825371 it could be regulatory complacency better reporting or immigration sweeps that have left slaughterhouses empty of skilled workers global warming may be spreading fecal dust high oil prices may have led to an e coli producing diet for cattle the microbe itself may even be evolving to elude capture another possibility is that the higher costs of slaughterhouse inputs beef cattle have collided with retailers low price pressures on outputs hamburger from those same slaughterhouses these ideas need investigation and research so that real change can begin
1825372 there are a lot of very smart very dedicated professionals in the food safety community
1825373 they have spent their careers working toward a better food supply and that collective knowledge is available to design and implement change we need our leaders to get on board and get the food safety train back on track
1825374 im saying hes a hypocrite hes not looking to police himself but hes looking to police the rest of us
1825375 i ask the speaker if hes so committed to this project why isnt it in his own district
1825376 allison is a special interest puppet who is not terribly bright and doesnt stand for anything so of course shes against cleaning up elections in new jersey
1825377 rescue funds for this program would be unconstitutional and would not survive a court challenge
1825378 without that component i think the clean elections program is mortally wounded it should have been defeated before that decision came down but with that decision it is an intractable program
1825379 i dont think anybody would argue that the results of the election should be overturned or reversed
1825380 the evidence clearly shows that candidates continue to rely on interest group members to collect the small contributions needed to qualify for clean elections programs
1825381 if the goal of taxpayer funded campaigns was to eliminate or substantially reduce the influence of special elections it is clear that clean elections has failed to achieve that goal
1825382 taxpayer funded political campaigns cant improve public perception because most public perception is from ideology and partisanship which is not going away any time soon
1825383 i dont know where they got their data so god bless them i can tell you that every one of our contributions was one in a series of backyard barbeques and coffee gatherings organized by individuals along with some mailings
1825384 allison and jay are right but ending the culture of corruption has many roads and one of them is the clean elections program one is getting rid of wheeling one is getting rid of leadership committees and one is lowering campaign contributions
1825385 the prosecutors latest submission is a complete reversal of its prior position and flies in the face of the facts and the law applicable to this case
1825386 other than 2 late fees or even over a restrict fees

1825408 within 20 years muslims will be in a majority in europe
1825409 this figure has many implications the muslims keep having many children while the europeans do not this means that within 20 years the muslims will be in a majority which may have an exceptional influence on the decision making
1825410 each person should say i am an ambassador for islam and they should take all action throughout europe
1825411 the banner of jihad holy war is raised up high to restore to our umma islamic community the pride and honor and in which the banner of gods unity is raised once again over every stolen islamic land from palestine to al andalus and other islamic lands that were lost because of the betrayals of rulers and the feebleness of muslims

1825416 plans include the construction of a half size replica of cordobas eighth century great mosque according to the head of cordobas muslim association funds for the project are being sought from the governments of the united arab emirates and kuwait and muslim organizations in morocco and egypt other big mosques are reportedly planned for medina azahara near cordoba seville and grenada the bishops of these cities are alarmed at the construction of ostentatious mosques fearing that the churchs waning influence may be further eclipsed by resurgent islam financed from abroad
1825417 al andalus will continue being al andalus for muslims of all ages it is there we have created it
1825418 islam will take over europe without violent force within a few decades
1825419 to grant spanish citizenship to the descendents of the moors moriscos and the andalusians who were expelled from spain in 1610
1825420 al andalus is a myth a myth about the unity of muslims a myth about a great muslim dominated civilization presented as an alternative to the west
1825421 al qaida wants to revive this myth but we cannot ignore the fact that after some time it will have disagreeable territorial consequences

1825437 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1825438 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1825439 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1825440 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1825441 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1825442 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign
1825443 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man
1825444 i am not familiar with the particulars of the case so i am commenting in general the fec will have to examine all the circumstances before determining any wrongdoing

1825447 americans have always always looked at and judged the character and personality of their candidates for president and they have been right to do so
1825448 things seem to be going against barack obama and for john mccain
1825449 it is our conviction that dialogue would have been more meaningful if the players were broadened than is the current scenario reducing participants to zanu pf and two mdc formations led by tsvangirai and mutambara is at best too simplistic and at worst a fabrication of political processes
1825450 the coalition is utterly opposed to a pact agreed between the political elite which does not adequately address the socioeconomic and political crisis which is by and large a crisis of governance and legitimacy
1825451 the real fear is that expanding the negotiating process could raise more dust than shed light on the way forward
1825452 the real key issues in the current negotiations are about leadership so there is simply no meaningful role for any of these civic society organisations

1825457 i am really struggling with x y or z pick a sin pattern but its so embarrassing that i really dont want anyone to know that i am struggling because they might actually ask whats going on and then i either have to dance around it or lie and i am not supposed to lie so its just easier to avoid it all

1825570 what does the stock market do during bear markets it has days where it gains more than 300 points in a day what doesnt the stock market do in a bull market it does not have days where it gains more than 300 points in a day
1825571 although financial stocks rallied sharply during mid july we believe the gains will be short lived we expect that the negative effects of continued home price declines and contracting credit will lead to a decline in consumer spending and in turn a decline in u s gdp
1825572 as the economy weakens we expect credit costs will continue to rise resulting in weaker financial earnings the need for additional capital and lower stock prices for financials

1825580 my roommate and i became lazy about locking our door
1825581 we figured no one would bother going all the way up there

1825583 on top of this there are the crazies whom it is impossible to reason with who do not have a life of their own and so insist on ruining the lives of others and preferably as many as possible in the end i concluded that it is no longer possible for me to have a blog that will be respected for what it is a personal blog i dont draw any grand conclusions from this and hope others dont either the decision was 100 mine no one at google ever asked suggested or hinted that i should end the blog to the contrary in keeping with deep commitment to free speech the company encourages blogs like mine and has stood completely behind me

1825586 indien u lid bent van onze vereniging worden een aantal zaken verzorgd en worden de kosten hiervan tot een bepaald bedrag door de vereniging gedragen tegen de bijkomende kosten welke niet door de vereniging worden betaald kunt u zich eventueel bij verzekeren
1825587 een lidmaatschap kost 15 per jaar en de eerste 900 euro voor de uitvaart wordt door de vereniging vergoed
1825588 je kunt ruwweg 3 personen of groepen van personen onderscheiden die de uitvaart moeten betalen 1 de opdrachtgever van de uitvaart hij of zij mag uiteraard verrekenen met de nalatenschap maar als die onvoldoende is is hij zij contractueel gebonden aan de uitvaartverzorger en moet hij zij zelf bijleggen 2 de erfgenamen de opdrachtgever als bedoeld onder 1 behoort meestal tot de erfgenamen 3 een groep bloed en aanverwanten zij zijn soms erfgenamen soms niet als zij geen opdrachtgever zijn zijn ze toch aanspreekbaar als de gemeente als niemand anders opdrachtgever is de uitvaart verzorgt en betaalt kan de gemeente de kosten op deze mensen verhalen deze laatste groep mensen die uiteindelijk aanspreekbaar zijn voor de kosten van lijkbezorging van een ex familielid staat in de wet genoemd artikel 392 e v boek 1 burgerlijk wetboek het zijn de ouders kinderen en behuwdkinderen schoonouders en stiefouders maar zij komen pas aan bod nadat de echtgenoot of vroegere echtgenoot of geregistreerd partner aan zijn of haar jas is getrokken er gelden nog wat uitzonderingen en beperkingen ook de natuurlijke vader van een kind en de levensgezel van de moeder die zelf niet de verwekker is maar wel instemde met de daad die de verwekking tot gevolg had het burgerlijk wetboek is allesbehalve saai zoals u ziet zijn aanspreekbaar u kunt het zelf nalezen deze wet is op verschillende plaatsen op internet te vinden het is denkbaar dat je als achterachterneef de rekening van een uitvaart gepresenteerd krijgt maar dan krijg je die niet als bloed of aanverwante als bedoeld in artikel 392 en volgende dan krijg je die als erfgenaam en het aangename daarvan is dat er dan meestal nog iets overschiet als er niets overschiet en de erfgenaam zou moeten bijleggen kan hij de erfenis verwerpen datzelfde geldt ook voor erfgenamen die geen enkele familierelatie met de overledene hadden ex echtgenoten moeten de uitvaartkosten van hun ex partner betalen maar hun ouders niet omgekeerd hoeven ex echtgenoten ook niet de uitvaartkosten van hun voormalige schoonhouders te betalen wel is een schoonzoon of schoondochter tijdens huwelijk verplicht bij te dragen aan de kosten van de uitvaart van de schoonouders
1825589 op grond van artikel 22 van de wet op de lijkbezorging mag de gemeente de kosten van de begrafenis verhalen op de kinderen als de kosten niet uit de nalatenschap betaald kunnen worden

1825624 the federal rule that a law enforcement proceeding to justify non disclosure of a public record must be an imminent adjudicatory proceeding of finite duration

1825665 its a great process for refining tinkering and so on but self organization is the process that is needed alongside natural selection before you get the kind of creative power that we see around us understanding how those two processes combine is the biggest challenge in biology

1825752 sent dijo que no hay un programa fijo con el que se pueda llegar a la verdad la verdad es una tierra sin caminos ninguna religi n es capaz de llevarnos a la espiritualidad o a la libertad las religiones son una causa de esclavitud tanto como cualquier otra s lo nos pueden ofrecer una jaula o prisi n religiosa para andar libres tenemos que deshacernos de todas las muletas las religiones no son m s que los intereses creados de la creencia organizada separando y dividiendo a las personas las religiones se basan esencialmente en el miedo cuando comprend esto cuando lo vi claro como la luz del d a me dije si es as entonces yo no puedo liderar una orden religiosa
1825753 antes de disolver la orden de la estrella tuve que disolver mi propio miedo mi propia inseguridad una vez logrado eso lo dem s se hizo f cil sencillamente anunci que la orden no s lo no era esencial sino que era una absoluta barrera contra el verdadero entendimiento as que no se pod a justificar m s y as fue
1825754 cuando se dieron cuenta de que no s lo estaba yo abandonando la orden sino que tampoco les estaba ofreciendo un ideal que pudieran perseguir se sintieron defraudados la gente ansiaba certezas yo les estaba ofreciendo sorpresas
1825755 si no les estabas ofreciendo un ideal entonces qu les estabas ofreciendo
1825756 amistad conversaci n y di logo para explorar la naturaleza de la realidad la verdad no es algo prefabricado que te pueda dar una religi n o un maestro la verdad necesita ser descubierta la vida es un viaje de descubrimiento la certeza s lo es posible cuando existe algo fijo y permanente mientras que la realidad se mueve y cambia continuamente se encuentra constantemente en estado de transformaci n si nuestras mentes est n atadas a una creencia fija a una determinada sabidur a entonces c mo podemos bregar con este cambio continuo ya que la realidad no es est tica necesitamos mentes r pidas y corazones flexibles s lo entonces sabremos responder ante la naturaleza din mica de la existencia yo no pod a y no puedo ofrecer m s que una constante conversaci n y exploraci n a trav s de tal exploraci n podemos disfrutar de libertad total del miedo y de ideales fijos
1825757 est s diciendo que no hay nada de valor en los grandes textos religiosos como la bhagavad gita o la biblia
1825758 puede que haya algo de valor en esos libros en t rminos de literatura o como un relato del pensamiento de una persona pero la verdad no est en ning n libro si la verdad estuviera all entonces no habr a ning n conflicto entre la biblia y el cor n entre la bhagavad gita y los sutras budistas el conflicto s lo puede existir entre lo falso y lo falso no puede haber conflicto entre lo verdadero y lo verdadero ni entre lo verdadero y lo falso igual que no puede haber conflicto entre dos personas que amen la paz o entre una persona que ama la paz y otra que ama la guerra el conflicto en realidad sucede s lo cuando hay dos que aman la guerra y quieren salirse con la suya el conflicto religioso es entre una religi n falsa y otra religi n falsa las religiones se han convertido en veh culos de propaganda y la propaganda no es la verdad
1825759 quieres decir que las religiones no son parte de la soluci n sino parte del problema
1825760 has estado prestando atenci n a nuestra conversaci n tienes toda la raz n la verdad no se puede comprender a trav s de ning n credo ning n dogma ninguna sabidur a filos fica ninguna t cnica psicol gica ning n ritual o sistema teol gico la verdad se experimenta de momento a momento en la red de relaciones
1825761 te das cuenta se or de que t eres el mundo y el mundo eres t el mundo no es algo aparte de ti y de mi hay un hilo com n de relaciones que nos teje a todos juntos fundamentalmente estamos todos totalmente conectados superficialmente las cosas parecen estar separadas especies distintas razas distintas culturas y colores distintos nacionalidades y religiones y pol ticas distintas si te fijas bien inmediatamente ver s que todos somos parte del gran tapiz de la vida cuando podemos vernos a nosotros mismos como parte de este glorioso patr n de relaciones entonces los conflictos entre naciones religiones y sistemas pol ticos se acabar n los conflictos nacen de la ignorancia cuando ignoramos que toda la vida est interconectada entonces intentamos controlarnos los unos a los otros cuando no existe el entendimiento de que las relaciones son la base de nuestra existencia entonces s lo hay desintegraci n en la sociedad las relaciones son el cimiento sobre el que todos existimos
1825762 dices que la religi n la pol tica y las ideolog as han herido a la humanidad c mo podemos curar estas heridas c mo podemos regresar al estado de uni n
1825763 el problema es mucho m s profundo que lo concerniente a religiones o pol tica
1825764 comienza en nuestras mentes nuestros h bitos nuestras vidas existe un condicionamiento constante que ha perdurado durante siglos estamos sujetos al condicionamiento y participamos en nuestro propio condicionamiento el juzgar el prejuicio los gustos y disgustos todos forman parte del mismo problema se nos ha condicionado para creer que el observador es distinto a lo observado que el pensador est separado del pensamiento este dualismo esta divisi n en compartimentos es la madre de todos los conflictos la base de todo dolor y sufrimiento me entiendes se or es muy importante
1825765 espero haberlo entendido sin embargo c mo pasamos del dualismo a la totalidad
1825766 para poder sanarnos debemos ir m s all de las teor as las f rmulas y las respuestas prefabricadas
1825767 tiene sentido entiendo lo que dices pero cuando veo a esos ba istas ah abajo tus palabras parecen estar desconectadas de la manera en que ellos piensan sienten y viven parece existir una enorme brecha qu significan tus palabras para ellos
1825768 nada quiz s nada y sin embargo si no nos transformamos radicalmente corremos el riesgo de destruir no s lo a la especie humana sino a la tierra misma por favor piensa en las armas nucleares y lo que todo eso implica una vida completa noble y llena de claridad es un imperativo para la supervivencia no es una utop a o un lujo sino una necesidad por favor cuando miremos profundamente y nos veamos a nosotros mismos como una parte integral del universo entonces nuestras mentes parlanchinas se calmar n la sordidez de la guerra humana desaparecer conseguiremos establecer un parentesco profundo y perdurable con la naturaleza
1825769 sus palabras son radicales sus pensamientos sinceros pero puedes imaginarte un tiempo en el que estemos libres de templos iglesias mezquitas rezos curas partidos pol ticos y todo lo dem s que divide a la humanidad adem s no est tirando al beb con el agua sucia de la ba era
1825770 debemos comprender lo que es el beb y diferenciarlo del agua sucia de la ba era existe una gran diferencia entre la religi n y las religiones krishnaji estar a de acuerdo en que necesitamos ser religiosos pero necesitamos quedarnos con el agua sucia de los dogmas y las disciplinas
1825771 achyut t has pasado gran parte de tu vida en la pol tica eras un importante miembro del partido socialista de india trabajabas para conseguir una transformaci n a trav s del cambio pol tico pero ahora vives una vida tranquila en este bungalow rodeado de rboles y tranquilidad mientras hay millones de personas ah fuera sufriendo
1825772 la pol tica me fall y ha fallado a india
1825773 la alternativa es la educaci n debemos dejar de corromper y condicionar a nuestros ni os por eso krishnamurti y sus amigos han establecido colegios para hacer precisamente eso uno en el sur de india llamado rishi valley otro aqu otro en inglaterra y otro en california en estos colegios no existen dogmas fijos los ni os son capaces de aprender sobre la unidad de la vida a ver las cosas como son a ser ntegros y plenos yo encuentro mucha m s satisfacci n trabajando con ni os de la que hall en la pol tica

1825794 the establishment here says oh look were ahead of the europeans were 20 years ahead of the europeans thats just on the face of it wrong

1825797 doesnt understand because bush never even said there was a link between al qaeda and iraq that wasnt the premise for going in there
1825798 some say that iraq is not a part of the broader war on terror they claim that the organization called al qaeda in iraq is an iraqi phenomenon that its independent of osama bin laden and its not interested in attacking america that would be news to osama bin laden i presented intelligence that clearly establishes this connection the facts are that al qaeda terrorists killed americans on 9 11 theyre fighting us in iraq and across the world and theyre plotting to kill americans here at home again

1825816 hamdans trial violated two of the most fundamental criminal justice principles accepted by all civilized nations the prohibition on the use of coerced evidence and the prohibition on retroactive criminal laws the decision to keep these cases out of the ordinary criminal courts will produce years of appeals over novel legal issues raised by the untested military commissions system even after those appeals are finished the process will never be seen as legitimate by the world this case was the first trial run of the commissions system and the decision proves nothing except that the system itself should be scrapped terrorism related crimes should be tried in the time tested domestic criminal justice system a system whose rules have been designed over the centuries with two goals to seek out the truth and secure justice
1825817 that four great nations flushed with victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the most significant tributes that power has ever paid to reason
1825818 they havent merited much discussion in the presidential campaign nor are we as a nation riveted by the trial of the first defendant instead of a landmark case one that serves as a resonant reminder of the gulf separating us from our enemies we have detachment and ambiguity not just about the extent of hamdans guilt but also about the wisdom of the entire tribunal process as well as many other aspects of the prosecution of the war on terror

1825840 when george bush took office he had an energy policy he turned to dick cheney and he told cheney go take care of this so john mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1825841 told an audience in youngstown ohio that the bush energy policy crafted in large part by vice president dick cheney an ex oilman tilted to provide tax breaks and favorable treatment for big oil and that mccain would expand oil industry tax breaks by 4 billion
1825842 here in ohio youre paying nearly 3 70 a gallon for gas two and a half times what it cost when president bush took office senator mccain not only wants oil companies to keep every dime of that money he wants to give them more
1825843 noted that it was obama not he who had voted for
1825844 2005 energy bill which included major subsidies for oil companies
1825845 when the energy bill came to the floor of the senate full of goodies and breaks for the oil companies i voted against it senator obama voted for it

1825888 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes
1825889 in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will
1825890 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes
1825891 it also may help add some scientific weight to the argument that eating broccoli is good for you

1825975 now the real nature of calvinistic soteriology becomes plain it is no artificial oddity nor a product of overbold logic its central confession that god saves sinners that christ redeemed us by his blood is the witness both of the bible and of the believing heart the calvinist is the christian who confesses before men in his theology just what he believes in his heart before god when he prays he thinks and speaks at all times of the sovereign grace of god in the way that every christian does when he pleads for the souls of others or when he obeys the impulse of worship which rises unbidden within him prompting him to deny himself all praise and to give all the glory of his salvation to his savior calvinism is the natural theology written on the heart of the new man in christ whereas arminianism is an intellectual sin of infirmity natural only in the sense in which all such sins are natural even to the regenerate calvinistic thinking is the christian being himself on the intellectual level arminian thinking is the christian failing to be himself through the weakness of the flesh calvinism is what the christian church has always held and taught when its mind has not been distracted by controversy and false traditions from attending to what scripture actually says that is the significance of the patristic testimonies to the teaching of the five points which can be quoted in abundance owen appends a few on redemption a much larger collection may be seen in john gills the cause of god and truth so that really it is most misleading to call this soteriology calvinism at all for it is not a peculiarity of john calvin and the divines of dort but a part of the revealed truth of god and the catholic christian faith calvinism is one of the odious names by which down the centuries prejudice has been raised against it but the thing itself is just the biblical gospel

1825981 hello tim i read your review after i had already read the shack and i think your review is ridiculous your review reminds me of exactly why stodgy old religion is so unappealing to masses of people william young wrote a novel a story that inspired me and thousands of others to want to have a closer more intimate relationship with god all your theological arguments cant erase that
1825982 i was surprised that he seemed not as concerned due to the fact that it is a novel and so some leeway should be allowed for poetic license
1825983 william young wrote a novel a story that inspired me and thousands of others to want to have a closer more intimate relationship with god all your theological arguments cant erase that
1825984 readers are talking about the shack for its theology and its storyline not for its faulty mechanics reviewers have criticized the book for hinting at universalism as well as for feminism and a lack of hierarchy in the trinity rather than slicing and dicing the novel looking for proof of theological missteps a better approach might be to look at significant passages as springboards for deeper discussion the shack is a novel after all not a systematic theology
1825985 try to re read the shack with a more open mind

1826002 he responded by overruling the far sideline on a first serve on the next ball which is just bush league first of all its an unwritten rule youre not supposed to touch that unless youre its almost impossible to be 100 sure on balls that miss like this holding thumb and index finger up on the far side of the court when theyre traveling 130 miles per hour

1826143 all paris is at your command once more my love sarah my dear
1826144 dont tease me etienne or i shall tease you back
1826145 i take it your son has done as you ordered him
1826146 it was your decision etienne and it doesnt make a difference to me anymore
1826147 because etienne where she goes he is sure to follow
1826148 ah yes this antoine wolff her champion the one you are infatuated with
1826149 nothing but a boy too young to understand and he is nothing that we cant possess
1826150 antoine when clarissa morris came to visit you after that gunfight on the commons did she appear at first
1826151 miss morris hasnt said anything to us yet argus overruled
1826152 when miss morris came to visit you did she appear distraught
1826153 i smiled over at mother then remembering very well that day for how could i not
1826154 did miss morris appear distraught after this small talk you engaged in
1826155 the problem of her half brothers her father how she hated living in that house
1826156 that her half brothers charles and drake morris had made advances towards her
1826157 yes she not only appeared distraught mr askew she appeared damned terrified for her future for me for her very life
1826158 ridiculous your honor albert and his sons are not on trial
1826159 agreed mr askew reign in your witness and wrap this up
1826160 so from what had occurred between you and miss morris on that day what you had discussed would you say that something of a shall we say dishonorable act even a criminal act had been performed upon the person of clarissa morris by her father and half brothers
1826161 i was willing to take the blame for her fathers murder for it
1826162 one more outburst from this room and i shall send you all home for good
1826163 his baritone echoing in the courtroom the perfect counterpoint to stephen askews choirboy voice his tone of scholarly reassurance
1826164 swain all six foot four of him stood before me a little too close
1826165 do you like any other reasonable human being possess the slightest critical faculty of mind are you a gullible person
1826166 there is this beautiful young woman come to offer her condolences to you in your time of need when you have just fought her half brothers in a gun battle you were wounded correct
1826167 fell off your horse so the sight of clarissa morris in your bedroom i might add must have filled you with shall i say it hope
1826168 had you ever been alone with miss morris before this
1826169 your birthday party where as i recall you had gotten into a fight with charles morris where you challenged both of alberts sons to a duel
1826170 your honor mr swain is badgering the defendant badgering the witness whatever you like to call it
1826171 before you met miss clarissa morris had you ever been in love mr wolff
1826172 not no i hadnt not in the way i loved her
1826173 so then you were willing to face death in a duel with her brothers to defend not only your honor but that of miss morris would you call that more than love
1826174 your honor i object to this whole line of reasoning
1826175 this proves nothing but how two young people had fallen in
1826176 make me a happy man and get to the point
1826177 ill tell you what it is and dont object mr askew because you have the same document in your files
1826178 this mr wolff is the testimony of clarissa morris in the murder trial against her father and half brothers do you remember that
1826179 yes your honor i would like to read one sentence from the testimony of miss morris so that the jury may hear it
1826180 clarissa morris on the witness stand that witness stand good gentlemen of the jury
1826181 do you remember that mr wolff it was a statement made by clarissa morris about her fathers supposed threats to simone churtz a servant girl found murdered the crime this office charged her father and half brothers with
1826182 once again mr wolff do you believe everything people tell you or do you just suspend judgement for those you love
1826183 go ahead mr swain but you are trying my patience here
1826184 imagine this scenario mr wolff follow the logic of it if you can
1826185 this young woman comes to you in your room with a tale about her half brothers their supposedly amorous advances against her this is on the record in her testimony you a young man never in love before completely infatuated with miss morris willing even to die for her hears her tale of woe and believes it without question you never question it because to do so would ruin your chance at having this woman for your own are you following this mr wolff
1826186 precisely my point mr wolff as far as anyone knows you and miss morris either in that little meeting in your bedroom or at another time may have conspired to murder her father albert morris and her innocent stepmother
1826187 do you follow the logic now mr wolff you believe her story but she has another motive in mind and a willing accomplice more than willing a young man ready to die for her and what would she stand to gain by the death of her father nothing but his entire fortune and the end of her supposed misery
1826188 and after the murder of albert morris and his wife and the burning down of his home not only do you disappear under suspicious circumstances but who else disappears yes thats right miss clarissa morris whom i might add has not shown up in this courtroom to defend you how convenient yes convenient but i wouldnt call it just that mr wolff i would also call it suspect even criminal
1826189 do you remember what she said mr wolff do i have to read it again
1826190 but can it be possible that she lied that is what matters in the end your love for her your gullibility your infatuation she could have lied to you and you could have believed her now i ask you is it possible
1826191 no it is not possible you are wrong dead wrong
1826192 your honor i want this whole testimony stricken from the record and to show that the prosecutor
1826193 pandemonium ensued as my attorney and the prosecutor feuded over the fine points of the law over anything they saw fit to save their cases

1826400 nuclear power takes too long to build is too expensive too risky and unsafe nuclear power is not the solution to help texas meet its power needs there are cheaper cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions
1826401 the utility industry sold texas on nuclear power plants at comanche peak and the south texas project and consumers have been paying the stranded costs ever since meanwhile the nuclear industry expends valuable water resources more destructive uranium mining contaminates south texas aquifers and mining sites around the world and radioactive waste piles up on site at nuclear power plants with no long term disposal facility
1826402 it doesnt make sense to have a public meeting before the license application is available for people to look at the public needs to know what it is they are commenting on a license application by another company nrg who want to expand the matagorda county south texas project was so incomplete that the nrc halted their review
1826403 the rush to build new nuclear power plants is simply an attempt to take advantage of federal subsidies while they are available and then hope to pass the building operating and decommissioning costs and any liability from accidents off on the public
1826404 analysis by both moodys and by independent consultants is putting a price tag of 12 to 17 billion for the proposed nuke in south texas by nrg and we would expect the victoria plant to cost even more due to its new unproven design and the increasing rising costs of uranium steel and cement
1826405 the cost of solar concentrating power plants solar panels wind energy and especially energy efficiency measures has come down and are now more economical than any new nuclear plant this means that investing in nuclear power with all of the risks of accidents terrorist attacks and the impossibility of ever being able to deal with radioactive waste is foolhardy and outrageous
1826406 just last month the public utility commission approved a massive transmission line plan to west texas that will lead to 18 000 mws of wind coming on line within five to 10 years exelon should get on board and also look at the potential for solar and geothermal energy along the gulf coast which on per kilowatt basis will generate far more jobs than nuclear nuclear itself will take billions of investment and years to complete and will do nothing to help energy costs or meet our present demand in fact it will likely force prices to go up to pay off the upfront costs
1826407 im here today because ive been a long term tibet activist and i feel like now is a really critical time for tibet
1826408 the beijing games have been used by the chinese government as a propaganda tool to whitewash their human rights record in tibet
1826409 we want to express our strong opposition to this china has relevant laws regarding protests and gatherings we truly hope that foreigners coming to visit china will respect the relevant laws of china
1826410 we are in touch with the chinese authorities and are requesting immediate consular access should this information be correct
1826411 very nervous obviously because of the opening ceremony tomorrow and they dont want to spoil that
1826412 lucy is fighting for the freedom and democracy of tibet and is doing what she feels is right and what i feel is right

1826414 my hair started to fall out and i actually started to urinate blood
1826415 they took me to the hospital tent for a check up but couldnt determine what was wrong so i was eventually sent home
1826416 i have no doubt at all that my illness was caused directly from the work i did at hiroshima
1826417 the government told me in writing that by the time our clean up crew got there hiroshima radiation levels would have been negligible
1826418 but actually fallout material has a half life of about four and a half billion years

1826425 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and finance needs
1826426 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1826427 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1826428 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1826429 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1826430 to assume were going to pay for it all is just wrong
1826431 nonetheless the pace of spending has been held back by various factors including deficiencies in capacity and security
1826432 gone is my glory and all that i had hoped for from the lord
1826433 paying more to gas up your car may mean paying less to insure it
1826434 higher gas prices lead to less driving and as new yorkers drive less the number of accidents should go down
1826435 geico is to be commended for its decision to withdraw its rate increase request based on how changes in driver habits in new york affected its recent loss experience we hope other insurers will also carefully evaluate the effects of reduced driving in new york
1826436 we have been concerned about an upward trend in some of the recent rate filings we have received that may not fully take into account the impact of high gas prices on new york drivers as governor paterson said these are difficult economic times for new yorkers and the insurance department is committed to doing all it can to ensure new york drivers receive the benefit of any reductions in auto insurance claims let me be clear there may be other factors involved and we recognize that auto insurance losses have been increasing recently we are not making a prejudgment but we do expect insurance companies to explain the rate impact of higher gas prices and the resulting dramatic reduction in driving we are seeing in the latest federal statistics we will take that into account as we evaluate rate increase requests

1826440 for people who would like to dispose of unused pharmaceuticals in their home the illinois epa will continue collecting at its household hazardous waste collection event which are held across the state each spring and fall
1826441 nationwide the 19 25 age group is the least likely to be insured this means they are less likely to have consistent doctors visits and access to preventable care these young adults dont have much in savings and would likely go into debt if they had to pay out of pocket for a serious illness or injury
1826442 but we can do something about this we can allow parents to keep their dependents on their health insurance coverage until they are 26 or until they are 30 if they are veterans today i ask the general assembly to accept these changes to provide important healthcare improvements for illinoisans
1826443 i am pleased with the changes governor blagojevich made to this legislation while my bill was a good bill we can now go further to helping young people stay on their parents health insurance coverage this means that more young adults can get access to healthcare coverage
1826444 as the director of the chronic illness initiative i understand the importance of students of having health care during the ebbs and flows of their illness our students struggle with serious illnesses which often require them to take a term or more away from school thereby jeopardizing their health insurance coverage amending this bill to allow students to remain on their parents health coverage until they are 25 or age 29 if they are a vet will be of great benefit to them
1826445 parents arent in control anymore they all feel like they have to be their kids best friend
1826446 before we have kids we have to take at least one big trip somewhere because after that itll be 18 years before we can really afford to travel again
1826447 look at your aunt deb and uncle terry they dont have kids and they seem really happy

1826449 a small but growing group of professionally trained psychotherapists who know the stress the dawning awareness of peak oil brings
1826450 this is our current estimate of what the whole repository program is going to cost how much to build it operate it and close it down
1826451 is a lot of money but compared to what i would argue strongly the cost of doing nothing is a lot higher
1826452 secondly i think most people would take the doe number for construction and throw in another half
1826453 our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge
1826454 to keep jobs here at home and create new ones
1826455 most americans identify the surge as taking resources and putting them where theyre needed for success
1826456 this is a concept that we feel like we can replicate
1826457 theres a chinese oil rig drilling off the coast of florida right now its based in cuba more are coming soon are we really gonna let the chinese drill up our own oil and sell it back to us at a profit
1826458 it is our understanding that although cuba has leased out exploration blocks 60 miles off the coast of southern florida which is closer than american firms are allowed to operate in that area no chinese firm is drilling there
1826459 a willingness to accept myself as i am strengths and weaknesses and then the determination to work towards a healthy ideal for myself

1826464 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
1826465 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1826466 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1826467 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1826468 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

1826497 today we stand as a bold and prophetic witness against the tyranny and brutality by the chinese government against their own people
1826498 china also promotes the barbaric practice of forced abortion and sterilization while those who speak out against human rights abuses by the chinese government are crushed and trampled and the peaceful citizens of tibet have been brutalized by chinese leaders
1826499 today we follow the teachings of jesus in matthew 25 and stand in solidarity with our oppressed chinese brothers and sisters our public witness is a visible reminder that 100 000 military troops and abusive security measures cannot silence the voice of freedom justice and the power of the gospel of christ the truth will always be heard and we hope that president bush will boldly speak out against these human rights abuses on his official visit to china during the olympics
1826500 i gladly risk my freedoms to speak out for those who have none it is an honor to stand in solidarity with our chinese brothers and sisters who risk their lives every day for expressing the simple act of worshipping their god
1826501 as a young woman i passionately speak out against the pain and suffering that chinese women must face daily through the practice of forced abortion and human trafficking
1826502 we pray that god will bring an end to these human rights abuses by the chinese government and one day the world will see justice liberty and freedom for the beautiful people of this wonderful country
1826503 we are willing to risk some minor hardship to provide this public witness for jesus christ and against the worst human rights abuses in the history of the world our prayer is our witness will stir christians across the world to take a public stand for jesus christ and his gospel of life

1826506 when you ask for volunteers to run across an open field to a reinforced op that almost everybody is injured at and everybody volunteers it feels good at least three soldiers went to the op to rescue pitts but they suffered wounds after encountering rpg and small arms fire but pitts survived the battle ive never seen the enemy do anything like that
1826507 perhaps the most important takeaway from that encounter though is the one that the mainstream media couldnt be bothered to pay attention long enough to learn that not for the first time a contingent of american soldiers that was outnumbered by up to a twenty to one ratio soundly and completely repulsed a complex pre planned assault by those dedicated enough to their cause to kill themselves in its pursuit

1826539 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes

1826671 he loved her for the longest time until she left him that first time and then when she came back it was like they were two completely different people i had one hell of a time dealing with the two of them then
1826672 like i said before elle its complicated but no matter how my brother felt afterwards about her leaving him he couldnt just send her away shes just far too important to him shes in essence what keeps him together what keeps him tied to this earth my greatest fear was always that one day like tonight wed lose her

1826928 we could probably keep another clinic like this one afloat
1826929 we have a business model that works because this is all we do five days a week 12 months of the year
1826930 we typically average somewhere around 72 to 75 patients a day
1826931 we made it clear if they chose to come into the state that we would have our eyes on their operation
1826932 the working relationship between forba and the pearl network will allow for a broader base of clinical studies to include a wider consideration of the population
1826933 forba provides dental care to a unique population which provides an opportunity for the pearl network to be more inclusive of its clinical studies
1826934 the synergy between forba and the pearl network will be manifested in the breadth of the patients considered for the clinical studies and in translating the clinical data to all socioeconomic levels

1826939 at the time of closing indymac bank f s b had about 1 billion of potentially uninsured deposits held by approximately 10 000 depositors
1826940 the basic insurance amount is 100 000 per depositor per insured bank certain retirement accounts such as individual retirement accounts are insured up to 250 000 per depositor per insured bank if you and your family have 100 000 or less in all of your deposit accounts at the same insured bank you do not need to worry about your insurance coverage your deposits are fully insured certain retirement accounts these are deposit accounts owned by one person and titled in the name of that persons retirement plan only the following types of retirement plans are insured in this ownership category individual retirement accounts iras including traditional iras roth iras simplified employee pension sep iras and savings incentive match plans for employees simple iras section 457 deferred compensation plan accounts whether self directed or not self directed defined contribution plan accounts self directed keogh plan or h r 10 plan accounts all deposits that an individual has in any of the types of retirement plans listed above at the same insured bank are added together and the total is insured up to 250 000 for example if an individual has an ira and a self directed keogh account at the same bank the deposits in both accounts would be added together and insured up to 250 000 naming beneficiaries on a retirement account does not increase deposit insurance coverage note for information about fdic insurance coverage for a type of retirement plan not listed above refer to the fdic resources on the back of this brochure joint accounts these are deposit accounts owned by two or more people if both owners have equal rights to withdraw money from a joint account each persons shares of all joint accounts at the same insured bank are added together and the total is insured up to 100 000 if a couple has a joint checking account and a joint savings account at the same insured bank each shares of the two accounts are added together and insured up to 100 000 providing up to 200 000 in coverage for the couples joint accounts example john and mary have a 220 000 cd at an insured bank under fdic rules each persons share of each joint account is considered equal unless otherwise stated in the banks records john and mary each own 110 000 in the joint account category putting a total of 20 000 10 000 for each over the insurance limit revocable trust accounts these are deposits held in either payable on death pod accounts or living trust accounts payable on death pod accounts also known as testamentary or totten trust accounts are the most common form of revocable trust deposits these informal revocable trusts are created when the account owner signs an agreement usually part of the banks signature card stating that the deposits will be payable to one or more named beneficiaries upon the owners death living trusts or family trusts are formal revocable trusts created for estate planning purposes the owner of a living trust controls the deposits in the trust during his or her lifetime note determining coverage for living trust accounts can be complicated and requires more detailed information about the fdics insurance rules than can be provided in this publication if you have a living trust account contact the fdic at 1 877 275 3342 for more information deposit insurance coverage for revocable trust accounts is based on each owners trust relationship with each qualifying beneficiary while the trust owner is the insured party coverage is provided for the interests of each beneficiary in the account the fdic insures the interests of each beneficiary up to 100 000 for each owner if all of the following requirements are met the beneficiary is the owners spouse child grandchild parent or sibling adopted and stepchildren grandchildren parents and siblings also qualify in laws grandparents great grandchildren cousins nieces and nephews friends organizations including charities and trusts do not qualify the account title must indicate the existence of the trust relationship by including a term such as payable on death in trust for trust living trust family trust or an acronym such as pod or itf for pod accounts each beneficiary must be identified by name in the banks account records if any of these requirements are not met the entire amount in the account or any portion of the account that does not qualify would be added to the owners other single accounts if any at the same bank and insured up to 100 000 if the revocable trust account has more than one owner the fdic would insure each owners share as his or her single account note the following example applies to pod accounts only coverage may be different for some living trusts example bill has a 100 000 pod account with his wife sue as beneficiary sue has a 100 000 pod account with bill as beneficiary in addition bill and sue jointly have a 600 000 pod account with their three children as equal beneficiaries these three accounts totaling 800 000 are fully insured because each owner is entitled to 100 000 of coverage for the interests of each qualifying beneficiary in the accounts bill has 400 000 of insurance coverage 100 000 for the interests of each qualifying beneficiary his wife in the first account and his three children in the third account sue also has 400 000 of insurance coverage 100 000 for the interests of each qualifying beneficiary her husband in the second account and her three children in the third account when calculating coverage for revocable trust accounts be careful to avoid these common mistakes do not assume that coverage is calculated as 100 000 times the number of people owner s and beneficiary ies named on a trust account coverage is provided for the interest of each qualifying beneficiary named by each owner additional coverage is not provided to the owners for naming themselves as owners for example a fathers pod account naming two sons as equal beneficiaries is insured to 200 000 only 100 000 for the interest of each qualifying beneficiary do not assume that the fdic insures pod and living trust accounts separately in applying the 100 000 per beneficiary insurance limit the fdic combines an owners pod accounts with the living trust accounts that name the same beneficiaries at the same bank

1826947 nonviolence did have its day nonviolence unquestionably defined the black freedom movement from 1954 1963 through the montgomery bus boycott the lunch counter sit ins and the freedom rides but by the end of 1962 martin luther king and the more militant nonviolent organizations had fallen victim to state repression and terrorism the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc core the congress of racial equality and southern christian leadership conference sclc had all failed to secure local reform voting rights or protective federal legislation appeals to the conscience of whites had foundered in the south and were having limited success in the north by the beginning of 1963 the kennedy administration was backtracking on promised civil rights legislation terrorism and legal repression had so demoralized the movement that activists concluded that federal intervention was their only salvation activists were learning that the myth of nonviolence rested on a perilous underestimation of racism and a misplaced confidence in the american conscience and democratic institutions then came the birmingham campaign in 1963 and more important the birmingham riots the first riot occurred on 3 may after police opened up with water cannons on protesters young black men nonpacifists who had previously lingered on the sidelines now retaliated with bricks and bottles on 4 may three thousand blacks most of whom were uninvolved in nonviolent marches assembled in downtown birmingham and clashed with police again three days later a peaceful protest sparked more displays of force by nonmovement blacks including several hundred who encircled two police officers finally in the early hours of 12 may a massive riot broke out in response to two ku klux klan bombings the night before for the first time in the history of the civil rights movement working class blacks took to the streets in a violent protest against police brutality and klan terror the young blacks who defied kings strictures irreversibly altered the strategy of the civil rights movement raising the specter of massive black civil violence and ultimately forcing the first real concession in the form of the civil rights act from birmingham forward every peaceful nonviolent protest carried the threat of black violence the birmingham riots marked the end of nonviolence and the advent of a movement characterized by both lawful mass protest and defensive violence

1826990 we have the opportunity to restore one of these which is restoring history

1826994 john mccain supports bushs tax cut for millionaires but nothing for 100 million households hes for billions in new oil company giveaways while gas prices soar and for tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas the original maverick or just more of the same
1826995 sir alex ferguson heard my arguments i heard his and in fact it was settled that the best for both parties would be for me to stay
1826996 therefore i can confirm that next season i will play for manchester united
1826997 before rumours emerge saying that i will play against my will i want to make this clear whoever says or writes that is lying
1826998 i will play for manchester with all my heart and soul i will fight and honour that shirt with the same commitment and dedication as always
1826999 i was responsible for all this controversy i was the one who publicly expressed my desire to go to real madrid i ended up being even involuntarily responsible for the poor relationship between the two clubs
1827000 i knew real madrid were interested in signing me and that they had allegedly made a very high offer to manchester united
1827001 my desire was for some time that manchester had accepted my transfer to madrid saying otherwise would be to trick people and my own consciousness
1827002 intense pressure from further declines in crude oil and an additional gain in the u s dollar prevented the precious metal from regaining its composure

1827006 my attorneys fees were agreed at 25 percent were earned at 25 percent and i request that your honor please pay these attorneys fees at 25 percent of my recovery
1827007 ultimately i believe that a deal is a deal i received what i bargained for and our outstanding attorneys should receive what they bargained for as well
1827008 although i approved the settlements i did so without being aware of the considerations that now impel me to disapprove them
1827009 the wounds of 9 11 will not easily be assuaged
1827010 but neither should they be exacerbated by rich rewards of fees and benign indifference to unreasonably large awards
1827011 he has gotten me through a lot of tough times i would believe what he has to say i have a lot of respect for him
1827012 i would have the tendency to believe they were telling the truth a little bit more
1827013 as a christian i wouldnt feel it would be my place to judge them
1827014 the faa does in all due respect an incredibly incomplete investigation
1827015 we just want the jury to hear the evidence and make a decision
1827016 i think its absurd that were paying for the reconstruction in a country when right at the beginning of the war the bush administration assured the american people that iraqs reconstruction would be paid for by iraq and through its oil revenues
1827017 inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1827018 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills is a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1827019 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1827020 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1827021 this outcome was pre determined not by the court but by the government well before the trial even began
1827022 the travesty of this is that mr hamdan should have been acquitted of all charges
1827023 the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully
1827024 we can only trust that the next subjects will include cooks tailors and cobblers without whose support terrorist leaders would be left unfed unclothed and unshod and therefore rendered incapable of planning or executing their attacks
1827025 this is an excellent example of the innovative ways in which we keep elvis catalog fresh for new and existing fans
1827026 were doing the same background we did originally on the recordings in 1957
1827027 elvis sounds great the recordings sound as if they were done yesterday
1827028 i am sure elvis would be proud to have worked with them
1827029 i dont really like fooling around with things like that all the elvis recordings are so good it kind of bothers me
1827030 some people get all upset if they mess with a classic but if you take a classic like a little less conversation i vaguely remembered that song until they redid it and now i adore it
1827031 he fired the generals and that is his constitutional right this is a coup detat against democracy
1827032 president abdallahi is the victim of a coup concocted by the army with the connivance of lawmakers in parliament
1827033 we condemn in the strongest possible terms the mauritanian militarys overthrow of the democratically elected government of mauritania
1827034 we call on the military to release the president and the prime minister and to restore the legitimate constitutional democratically elected government immediately
1827035 the members of the mauritanian parliament wish to underline that it was the army that liberated the mauritanian people from the yoke of the dictatorship of president taya and its them again today that are defending the democratic gains we made
1827036 went on to regroup and led a series of attacks against foreigners
1827037 he has gotten me through a lot of tough times i would believe what he has to say i have a lot of respect for him
1827038 i would have the tendency to believe they were telling the truth a little bit more
1827039 if victoria did assault ms brown god sees that and she will be judged in her own way
1827040 the faa does in all due respect an incredibly incomplete investigation
1827041 we just want the jury to hear the evidence and make a decision
1827042 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
1827043 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
1827044 an adequate explanation for his late laboratory work hours around the time of
1827045 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
1827046 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
1827047 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks
1827048 we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt
1827049 has been the sole custodian of rmr 1029 since it was first grown in 1997
1827050 the contaminant must have been introduced during the production of the post and brokaw spores
1827051 that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behavior
1827052 repeatedly named other researchers as possible mailers and claimed that the anthrax used in the attacks resembled that of another researcher
1827053 you know i hope that i and all americans can be colorblind about any president
1827054 makes tough decisions he takes charge hes ready to sacrifice his interest on behalf of the interest of the country
1827055 im not home a lot so michelle is usually willing to give it up
1827056 the only time i grab for the remote is when a game is on
1827057 sometimes i win the arm wrestling contest but foolishly she continues to try to assert her control over the remote
1827058 this is a battle that will continue for a long time
1827059 but they can still hang with spongebob squarepants and i have to say spongebob is pretty funny
1827060 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
1827061 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
1827062 an adequate explanation for his late laboratory work hours around the time of

1827070 repeatedly named other researchers as possible mailers and claimed that the anthrax used in the attacks resembled that of another researcher
1827071 we hear so often from parents that their kids want to relive the amazing experience shared at the circus and so they read the program book or watch the souvenir dvd over and over after seeing the shows
1827072 now those parents have an interactive exciting and educational destination for their children ringling com allows children to continue to explore the magic of the circus and reignite their imaginations long after the show has left town and until the all new edition arrives
1827073 we are addressing them in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties
1827074 i would say they the changes are fully responsive to the gaos direction but i would not consider this to be a substantial modification to the rfp
1827075 what we have done is give them a very clear and unambiguous insight into the technical factors that we are going to evaluate
1827076 represent a return to the first step of a process that already has gone on far too long
1827077 significant errors that could have affected the outcome in what was a close competition
1827078 it will be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1827079 and could i mention that senator obama a couple of days ago said that we ought to all inflate our tires and i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it but i also dont think that thats a way to become energy independent
1827080 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1827081 in five short months the bush administration will be done
1827082 were in indiana were campaigning with the most popular politician in indiana
1827083 ran an ad saying washington is broken no kidding it took him 26 years to figure it out
1827084 pre pma 2008 memory maker atp has launched what it describes as
1827085 sa iubim nebuneste tot ce straluceste pe acest pamant fiindca alta viata nu ne este cunoscuta
1827086 that is the perfect time to release this game well next to perfect i think perfect would have been day and date with the console releases but november 18 is shortly before thanksgiving this year which is the busiest season for video game sales shipping just before the holiday season is definitely the right thing to do
1827087 one of the big draws for pc gaming is multiplayer so if they can create a unique pc oriented multiplayer experience it could pull more people in if its something substantially different and its great it could even convince some of the people who bought the console version to buy the pc version just for the multiplayer well see
1827088 i doubt that the pc version will sell as well as the xbox360 or ps3 versions for one because the two console versions will have already been out for quite a long time so the people who wanted to play gta iv may have already bought it on one of those consoles secondarily pc games just arent selling as well as console games so the numbers will very likely not be near the console sales
1827089 gaming on pcs is thriving for massively multiplayer online games and is in a death spiral for other games
1827090 the pc gaming market still has its hits here and there
1827091 i think that its death has been vastly exaggerated that said the kinds of games people are playing on the pc are a lot different mmos like world of warcraft casual online games games etc it is hard to sell most console style games on the pc that is certain
1827092 were hoping to lower the barrier to participation by providing a forum for surfacing sharing and collaborating on new ideas and concepts our goal is to bring even more people to the table and provoke thought facilitate discussion and inspire future design directions for firefox the mozilla project and the web as a whole
1827093 as with most mozilla projects were developing the concept in the open and hope to see the idea and process evolve with the wider participation of the global community of collaborators if the early response is indication well certainly have more to share over the coming weeks and months
1827094 a sentence paragraph or even bullet points to kick start the process ideas can be simple and non technical it should be easy for anyone and everyone to help shape the future of the web so throw your notions inspirations dreams and visions out to the community
1827095 if nothing else this shows that data breaches and identity theft have become global crimes
1827096 there are too many retailers out there that are simply unprepared for this kind of crime both in preventing it and then in how to notify customers
1827097 wireless systems can be easily secured if only by walking through a stores parking lot with a laptop to make sure you are not transmitting
1827098 many stores dont know they have been hacked until complaints are made
1827099 the dirty little secret is that it security people know it but are powerless to stop it so they do nothing
1827100 what we are seeing are cases in which disclosure by the retailer happens only after a period of weeks or months

1827130 he said that she had offered him a ride home that they were friends and she had offered him a ride home and she didnt really know the way and so he was going to drive the vehicle
1827131 not long ago we decided that goes cube song 58 should be called sorry were you sleeping goes cube song 59 should be called read right goes cube song 61 should be called loose ends goes cube song 62 should be called gravestones like chess pieces and goes cube song 63 should be called clenching jaws goes cube song 60 will change too but its an instrumental and not recorded so were taking our time picking out a real interesting title for that one

1827139 he will get the first reps repetitions with the first team but if i name him the starter what do i tell will were going to let them all compete and see what happens
1827140 this time last year i wasnt sure if i would have a chance to play and then i got hurt now i know i have a chance to come out and compete for the job
1827141 im just going to go where they put me and see if i can help the team
1827142 they said they never had a chance to see me but they were only 10 minutes away
1827143 everything sounded like a big lie coming from them i just thought this was the best situation for me
1827144 he throws a nice ball and he makes good decisions in seven on seven drills over the summer he made just as good of decisions as mike and curtis did
1827145 he leads the right way not a rah rah guy but he leads by example hes got all the qualities that make a great leader hes got character he works hard and he makes his grades
1827146 i wouldnt be surprised if after 17 days of practice hes right up there
1827147 i think the only real weakness with him right now is recognizing coverages but thats with every young quarterback that will come
1827148 we encourage people to call us before they come down before they give the animal up

1827151 anything that we can do to make gasoline prices lower im in favor of if that means getting rid of zone pricing im in favor of that
1827152 the question is how long can they take that hit for and who do they want to compete with do they want to compete with an oil company that has the sovereignty of a small government i doubt itll last long

1827180 to have an opportunity like this to have a reputable company move into my hometown its an honor
1827181 i had my first round of interviews actually and that went well and ive been asked to come back for a second interview
1827182 the folks hired can be starting as soon as september 15th
1827183 the sooner we can get people on the ground the better
1827184 thats why we worked so hard to win this company we knew it would mean jobs for hamilton county residents and for people in our region and thats exactly what we were after
1827185 i suspect we will have the opportunity to sit down with vw people sometime between now and then end of the year and begin that conversation
1827186 we probably intend to do a second wave of hiring with these purchasing professionals by december of january as well

1827191 it doesnt cost a thing someone can come in and search all kinds of properties in geographic areas from athens tn down to rome ga and fort payne al they can target it on industrial office retail
1827192 the chambers have access real time to this data so if they have someone in town looking to place jobs in chattanooga for say 25 000 sq feet they can do a search and they have real time access and know broker the location
1827193 weve had a few more calls to the office theres been a lot of excitement but i cant say ive seen a big spike yet
1827194 it was unbelievable how brave he was even when he was being attacked he yelled to me to wind my window up in my vehicle as the dogs could turn on me
1827195 it was remarkable how he kept it all together throughout the ordeal he remained totally cool and calm
1827196 i feel very privileged to have both of you here today no one can prepare themselves for what they will do when confronted by such a situation
1827197 many people arriving at that scene would have gone for help or dialled 111 but you chose to intervene directly and it is indeed a privilege to be able to recognise your actions here today

1827213 the announcement a few days ago that ric flair and the wwe had mutually agreed to part ways surprised me
1827214 rics schedule with the wwe had been somewhat ambitious in rics view as ric was one the road as much or more than he had been with his wrestling schedule in his later career nonetheless ric said he was having a great time as a good will ambassador for the wwe when we spoke i do know that ric had apparently received several offers to do numerous outside projects that were beyond the parameters of the wwe and that he seemed keenly interested in doing

1827240 i am less interested in treating geeks as natives to be explained and more interested in arguing with them the people in two bits are a sine qua non of the ethnography but they are not the objects of its analysis
1827241 a very important aspect of the contemporary internet is its singularity there is only one internet
1827242 the outcome of the decisions to create certain configurations standards and protocols to make the internet work has been to privilege the singularity of the internet and to champion its standardization
1827243 the cover of two bits features one panel from a series of paintings by pierre puvis de chavannes 1824 1898 a symbolist painter from lyon and co founder of the soci t nationale des beaux arts

1827256 our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge to keep jobs here at home and create new ones
1827257 raising taxes in a bad economy is about the worst thing you can do because it will kill even more jobs when what we need are policies that create jobs
1827258 what senator mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them
1827259 which makes sense because it turns out nascar which knows something about tyres apparently said the same thing so did the aaa and so in the coming days it is going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1827260 he is detained in a holding cell at hong kong airport
1827261 it is my understanding that he has refused to be put on an airplane back to tokyo
1827262 he has demanded his right as a chinese citizen with a valid chinese passport under the chinese constitution and also article 12 of the un covenant for civil and human rights to which china is a signatory to be able to continue his humanitarian mission on mainland china
1827263 i am a chinese citizen and i have every right to enter my country
1827264 unfortunately this is not an isolated case many hundreds if not thousands of my countrymen are denied the right of return
1827265 many of them have had their passports illegally confiscated this is an issue that must addressed by the international community
1827266 we are confident that dr ivins was the only person responsible for these attacks said jeffrey taylor us attorney for the district of columbia today
1827267 we are now beginning the process of concluding this investigation once this process is complete we will formally close the case
1827268 we have this anthrax death to america death to israel
1827269 ivins has claimed that he was suffering serious mental health issues in the months preceding the attacks and told a co worker that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behaviour
1827270 the duke of edinburgh has authorised us to confirm that the claim made by the evening standard that he has received a diagnosis of prostate cancer is untrue
1827271 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health it said
1827272 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumours that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
1827273 its become an open secret within the medical community that philip has prostate cancer
1827274 if hed had a serious chest infection that was so worrying it required hospitalisation he wouldnt have walked in and out of there smiling and been sitting up in bed replying to letters
1827275 so far in 2008 evidence points to a sharp slowing in activity alongside higher inflation
1827276 so close to zero essentially flat growth it doesnt take very much to push that into negative territory
1827277 given the outlook for inflation and the stance of fiscal policy directors saw little scope for monetary easing at present
1827278 r r remix the mashed up culture of anime fandom
1827279 a recursive public is a public that is constituted by a shared concern for maintaining the means of association through which they come together as a public
1827280 geeks express ideas but they also express infrastructures through which ideas can be expressed and circulated in new ways
1827281 the circularity is essential to the phenomenon a public might be real and efficacious but its reality lies in just this reflexivity by which an addressable object is conjured into being in order to enable the very discourse that gives it existence
1827282 knit a plurality of spaces into one larger space of non assembly
1827283 these were fans who were so passionate and enthusiastic about anime that they became vocal and informed critics
1827284 unfortunately the latest generation of anime viewers in japan are not true otaku
1827285 if a jobs worth doing its worth doing well my video was free and i got paid nothing but it didnt stop me researching translation theory for a year or hand drawing and animating the cut scenes just to grab peoples attention they certainly wouldnt stick around for my voice thats for sure

1827289 some could argue that such a model for fronting money isnt necessarily worth the rewards unless sales become scalable on a large scale the question remains whether or not its worth it to artists and supporters in the long run part of that answer could be boiled down to promotional options provided by cameesa and the drive of both artists and supporters some widgets badges and third party applications on social media sites could begin to help out towards this end
1827290 we want users to access the power of these innovations through as many channels as possible including mobile applications soft phone plug ins and carrier integration
1827291 todays announcement is the first step in making that possible
1827292 global aviation is making a painful adjustment to the new reality of us 100 plus oil cathay pacific is reducing other costs where it can but there is a limit to how much cost can be saved before quality and brand are compromised it is thus inevitable that fares for passengers and shippers will have to rise to reflect the new cost of operation it is difficult to forecast with any degree of accuracy the extent to which these higher fares will reduce demand but thus far it has remained robust despite the current difficulties cathay pacific remains confident in its future hong kong remains asias premier aviation hub and cathay pacifics superb international network affords unrivalled connectivity to and from china the companys priority at this time is to protect the integrity of this network there will be some redeployment of capacity within the network but it is not envisaged that the company will withdraw from any destination it now serves
1827293 this is an important upgrade for the e 6 fleet that will provide our warfighters with much greater situational awareness and allow them to more effectively comply with increasingly complex global airspace requirements
1827294 modern enka from en performance entertainment and ka song came into being in the postwar years of the sh wa period it was the first style to synthesize the japanese pentatonic scale with western harmonies enka lyrics as in portuguese fado usually are about the themes of love and loss loneliness enduring hardships and persevering in the face of difficulties even suicide or death enka suggests a more traditional idealized or romanticized aspect of japanese culture and attitudes comparable to american country and western music

1827297 pre pma 2008 memory maker atp has launched what it describes as
1827298 from oags statistics it looks quite possible that we may be facing a far more severe global downturn than we have experienced before the industrys resilience will be pushed to its limits in the coming months with carriers airports and passengers alike all waiting and watching for a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel
1827299 we expect new aircraft will drive the growth and the resulting honeymoon effect of low maintenance requirements could keep mro spend down
1827300 in its amended s 1 lendingclub disclosed that under a new formula it will also use several other credit markers in calculating interest rates specifically lendingclub will factor in a borrowers number of open accounts the number of credit inquiries in the last six months how much of a borrowers available credit is used up and length of credit history
1827301 its where you start to see milk really being used
1827302 as you go to other locations the cattle evidence is much weaker and the milk residues also show up much more weakly
1827303 this study shows that if you get into serious milk consumption where youre using pottery and preparing your milk its really related to cattle suddenly coming onstream
1827304 people generally expect that the climate is becoming more variable with climate change
1827305 if the climate becomes more variable year to year then potentially you may have less vegetation more fire then shifts in these different boundaries
1827306 the evergreen tree tends not to do as well with larger variability
1827307 part of the reason is if you kill an evergreen tree it takes a long time to grow back compared to a grass or even a deciduous tree
1827308 if there was no variability then the whole forest in the eastern united states would shift into the central united states
1827309 would tend to push the ecosystem to a lower density of overstory forest canopy and a more open type of a system
1827310 he got in a situation where he could use his legs
1827311 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got
1827312 but you think of a guy of jobas caliber and you know hes going to miss a start that doesnt mean the guy who replaces him cant pitch well
1827313 weve adopted a slower fitness programme and made a conscious decision that we couldnt risk me
1827314 so while weve been opening contract negotiations there have been a couple of meetings so far but it will take time its been gym work for me and by the end of last week i was running though i hadnt been sprinting flat out because that has to be the last stage before twisting and turning
1827315 its certainly not the ideal build up i really wanted to have a full pre season behind me this year because in the successful seasons in my career ive had a good pre season and when i havent had a good pre season ive struggled a little
1827316 maar we houden wel de invloed van de inflatie op onze kosten in het oog
1827317 i think the market is responding to the fact that we are here talking
1827318 i think the market realizes this kind of pressure from congress may in fact lead to a change in policy
1827319 i am taking a graphic design course now would i be able to use those skills in this job
1827320 how many people will i be working with the office
1827321 call upon all our supporters and members and any organs and structures under the direction and control of our respective parties to stop and desist the perpetration of violence in any form
1827322 i want to be with that special person i think to have sex before marriage is an individual decision waiting will strengthen that relationship
1827323 virginity is definitely something i like about myself it doesnt mean i havent thought about sex because everyone i know has had it and you want to fit in
1827324 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
1827325 nave a nice day or not the choice is yours
1827326 if youve done something right no one will know that youve done anything at all
1827327 if nothing else this shows that data breaches and identity theft have become global crimes
1827328 there are too many retailers out there that are simply unprepared for this kind of crime both in preventing it and then in how to notify customers
1827329 wireless systems can be easily secured if only by walking through a stores parking lot with a laptop to make sure you are not transmitting
1827330 many stores dont know they have been hacked until complaints are made
1827331 the dirty little secret is that it security people know it but are powerless to stop it so they do nothing
1827332 what we are seeing are cases in which disclosure by the retailer happens only after a period of weeks or months
1827333 that is the perfect time to release this game well next to perfect i think perfect would have been day and date with the console releases but november 18 is shortly before thanksgiving this year which is the busiest season for video game sales shipping just before the holiday season is definitely the right thing to do
1827334 one of the big draws for pc gaming is multiplayer so if they can create a unique pc oriented multiplayer experience it could pull more people in if its something substantially different and its great it could even convince some of the people who bought the console version to buy the pc version just for the multiplayer well see
1827335 i doubt that the pc version will sell as well as the xbox360 or ps3 versions for one because the two console versions will have already been out for quite a long time so the people who wanted to play gta iv may have already bought it on one of those consoles secondarily pc games just arent selling as well as console games so the numbers will very likely not be near the console sales
1827336 gaming on pcs is thriving for massively multiplayer online games and is in a death spiral for other games
1827337 the pc gaming market still has its hits here and there
1827338 i think that its death has been vastly exaggerated that said the kinds of games people are playing on the pc are a lot different mmos like world of warcraft casual online games games etc it is hard to sell most console style games on the pc that is certain
1827339 the totalitarian regime fell thanks in large part to him thanks to him the people understood that they themselves could oppose evil
1827340 this is a man i had always wanted to see
1827341 it is just too bad it was only after his death
1827342 he was our saviour the saviour of our morals our dignity our consciousness

1827350 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1827351 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1827352 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1827353 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1827354 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1827355 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1827356 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1827357 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want

1827359 90 billion barrels of oil and 1 670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas assessed in the arctic
1827360 the first publicly available petroleum resource estimate of the entire area north of the arctic circle
1827361 enough supply to meet current world demand for almost three years
1827362 may hold one fifth of the worlds undiscovered technically recoverable reserves of oil and natural gas
1827363 the race to claim territorial ownership of the resources already has begun
1827364 this study authoritatively refutes head on the mistaken belief that we do not have sufficient supply
1827365 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future

1827367 i dont think its cancerous but we will have to wait for the biopsy and then perhaps schedule yearly gastroscopies to keep things in check
1827368 being a life long celtics fan and seeing the team return to its championship legacy last spring i am thrilled to have them playing a game at the mullins center
1827369 hopefully the fans will come out and pack the mullins for the celtics game as a precursor to packing the building for our umass games during the season
1827370 were excited to bring the sixers to the mullins center for an entertaining night of nba basketball
1827371 this game allows us to expand our fan base and expose new fans to 76ers basketball while at the same time enabling one of the facilities we manage through our management subsidiary global spectrum to enhance its event schedule with top notch sports and attractions
1827372 the world champion boston celtics are looking forward to bringing professional basketball to our loyal fans in the western part of our state with this game being held at the state school which has a modern venue and a good history of collegiate hoops these two long time atlantic division rivals should tip off the preseason schedule with a bang
1827373 womens search for a safe place in the social and cultural spheres often takes priority over their search for physical protection from hiv and other sexually transmitted infections
1827374 to prevent hiv we have to promote social economic policy and cultural changes so that women and girls have greater control over their own lives and bodies these are the same changes that are fundamental to fighting poverty
1827375 we earn very little money here this is what makes us easy prey and exposed to hiv infection for example if a man tells you he will drive on mpilo boulevard an expression used to describe unprotected sex just because you are at the mercy of this person you agree to have unsafe sex in expectation that he will not withhold his money or other favors
1827376 empowering women is part of the solution insights from our preliminary research show that empowered women are better equipped to prevent and manage hiv risk in most situations
1827377 we have no choice but to focus on preventing hiv
1827378 we have a responsibility to do it in the most effective way possible by using a comprehensive development approach that looks at the underlying causes including poverty

1827408 while i was running to second i watched the whole thing transpire it was kind of weird because everything is happening that fast all at once you cant really tell whats going on and youre just waiting for it to end to really take a look the ball rolled on the wall for 10 feet and he came in and pulled down the offensive board it was even more amazing to see it on the replay
1827409 the biggest thing is you look around and nobody is counting on you to be that guy
1827410 youre just a complementary piece of that puzzle since ive been here ive had two guys on base every second or third time i get up there thats a testament to the lineup

1827425 there is no evidence to suggest the type of music you listen to will cause you to commit suicide but those who are vulnerable and at risk of committing suicide may be listening to certain types of music
1827426 but its important to point out that music doesnt cause these behaviours
1827427 its more a case of teenagers who may have a mental illness or are involved in these antisocial behaviours being drawn to certain types of music
1827428 over the years there have been concerns about suicidal themes in some music and whenever a famous person such as nirvana singer kurt cobain kills themselves we see a copycat effect among teenagers
1827429 but sometimes an adolescents musical tastes will reveal nothing the key to understanding any teenager is to treat them with respect by listening to what they have to say rather than typecasting them according to the type of music they listen to
1827430 it is strange that someone has said there is systematic doping these situations are very unpleasant but to say it is systematic is premature
1827431 as the olympic games come closer and closer china is continuing to use the games as a platform to legitimize their illegal occupation
1827432 the situation in tibet has not improved since china was awarded the olympics the situation in tibet has actually dramatically worsened
1827433 i think the olympics were politicized from the very beginning when the chinese government and the international olympic committee promised the world that human rights would improve inside china
1827434 all were doing is trying to tell the truth and use the olympic spotlight to shine it on the situation inside tibet
1827435 our job is to ensure that while individual rights are protected and respected we reach the most peaceful ending to any situation that were faced with
1827436 as canada prepares to host the 2010 winter olympics we must remind everyone that hosting the olympic games is not only a privilege it is a responsibility

1827447 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected also protect the dharmi to protect dharma and remember hindu vote is sacred never barter it away this should be our refrain campaign all over india at this critical juncture we should demand follow up action on the historic subject hindu akrosh appeasement is never good for a nation kanchan gupta lalit koul 10 000 forest trees are chopped down to build the mughal road in kashmir no one makes a noise acres and acres of land in the kashmir valley are allotted to lay sewage and drinking water pipes no one objects bandh s announced by the pro land transfer parties within the jammu province have paralysed the life in that part of the state as well a is 40 hectares of land enough to settle so many hindus that it would change the demographics of the valley b by putting this argument of demographic change are the valleys muslims implying that hindus are not welcome in the valley anymore and i do not mean the hindus from outside kashmir i mean the hindus from the state of jammu amp kashmir itself having touched upon the outlandish arguments of those who oppose the allotment of land let us look at some facts and the real story some of you might argue that it was not the valleys muslims but the political parties and terrorists who opposed the land transfer order and forced people to come out on the streets jammu is burning and as of now it appears unlikely that the rage sweeping through the entire province can be doused in the coming days on monday the police clueless as to how to handle the situation and directed by an inspector general of police who is an outsider shot at protesters in samba they did not shoot to injure or scare away the crowds chanting slogans against governor n n vohra and waving the national tricolour they shot to kill by aiming their guns at the protesters heads bandh and blockade of highways has been extended by another five days people continue to defy curfew and army pickets pouring into the streets in hundreds something unprecedented in india intifada the young and old men and women youth and children are locked in an unequal battle with the police and since friday the army demanding the immediate revocation of the government order cancelling the transfer of 800 kanals of land to the sri amarnath shrine board the land was meant for creating temporary facilities for pilgrims who trek to the amarnath shrine every year braving inclement weather and jihadi attacks intifada more tellingly the tactics that have been adopted by the protesters are those that have often brought the kashmir valley to a standstill if you look at the photographs of the hindu intifada you will get a sense of how jammu has decided to give kashmir a taste of its own medicine in this case it is dum dum dawai a public thrashing took to the streets insisting no land should be provided for pilgrim facilities the pdp sensing an opportunity to revive its pro separatist if not brazenly anti india anti hindu image in the run up to the assembly election in jammu amp kashmir joined the protest and subsequently azad stood firm and refused to budge from his governments decision till returning the land and also offering to relinquish the boards task of organising the annual yatra thus making the pilgrimage to the amarnath shrine subordinate to the valleys muslims above all politics and delhis equally odious politics of muslim appeasement explosion of outrage across jammu
1827448 i dont recall such a massive bandh in recent years
1827449 unless the country is protected dharma cannot be protected and unless dharma is protected the country cannot be protected
1827450 the news of that abject surrender provoked an explosion of outrage across jammu
1827451 the governor has violated the sasb act he cannot act unilaterally any decision of the board has to be endorsed by at least five members
1827452 he is also in contempt of the high court which had passed an interim order approving the transfer of 800 kanals of land to the board in baltal
1827453 i dont recall such a massive bandh in recent years
1827454 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley any more jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
1827455 mr vohra did neither he only added fuel to the fire by telling some people who went to plead with him why should i bother about jammu does jammu matter does jammu exist he has been insensitive and his actions have only served to provoke the protesters
1827456 years of neglect of jammu by kashmir has resulted in what you are seeing today the people are frustrated the pandits have at last found a platform to vent their anger jammu has more people than kashmir but the lions share always goes to the valley
1827457 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley
1827458 it was his way of registering his protest against mr omar abdullahs speech in parliament he was incensed by the national conference leaders duplicity

1827498 we have an administration that has set ambitious goals for nasa without giving nasa the support it needs to reach them
1827499 certainly it is possible that if china wants to put people on the moon and if it wishes to do so before the united states it certainly can as a matter of technical capability it absolutely can
1827500 and we have to do more than provide short term relief we have to secure our long term prosperity and strengthen americas competitiveness in the 21st century one of the areas where we are in danger of losing our competitive edge is our space program when i was growing up nasa inspired the world with achievements we are still proud of today we have an administration that has set ambitious goals for nasa without giving nasa the support it needs to reach them as a result theyve had to cut back on research and trim their programs which means that after the space shuttle shuts down in 2010 were going to have to rely on russian spacecraft to keep us in orbit
1827501 we cannot cede our leadership in space thats why i will help close the gap and ensure that our space program doesnt suffer when the shuttle goes out of service by working with senator bill nelson to add at least one additional space shuttle flight beyond 2010 by supporting continued funding for nasa by speeding the development of the shuttles successor and by making sure that all those who work in the space industry in florida do not lose their jobs when the shuttle is retired because we cannot afford to lose their expertise
1827502 more broadly we need a real vision for space exploration to help formulate this vision ill reestablish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore

1827527 additionally can you identify any actual inconsistencies with any argument for the theory of evolution instead of the typical strawmen and outright false claims that you have made in the past
1827528 because most of the attacks against my religious and scientific positions have come from atheists i figure that they have the least ability to tolerate dissenting viewpoints
1827529 i dont know what strawmen arguments and false claims youre talking about
1827530 that archaeopteryx was used as a promotional tool for transitional forms and exposed as a hoax therefore because it is not a transitional form is the fault of those junk scientists this fraud was exposed by other scientists in the field when they did more research on the subject
1827531 carbon dating is only accurate going back about 10 000 years
1827532 for something to be declared as a scientific fact it must be either observed in nature or reproduced under controlled conditions and subject to peer review
1827533 parts of that theory speciation and dna mutation do occur this is fact but speciation beyond the genus level has never been observed nor reproduced
1827534 thus the theory of evolution from proto bacteria to human being is just a theory please tell its supporters to stop presenting it as scientifically verified fact
1827535 speciation beyond the genus level has never been observed nor reproduced

1827762 while it is difficult to specify the percentage of counterfeit drug prevalence around the world studies show that this varies from 1 percent in developed countries to 30 percent in developing nations
1827763 we do not have a percentage and we cannot have one
1827764 because when fake drugs get to lebanon or any other country they do not come officially the only thing we say is that if we have only one box present this can kill one person and this is unacceptable to us
1827765 lebanon now has made the first step and is a leader in the awareness campaign in the region
1827766 but nothing will come out of it either we have an independent drug control lab or let the people suffer
1827767 when israel did air strikes in 2006 they dropped leaflets warning us to leave the village these salafis are trying to drive us out of the country
1827768 a huge number of families left for syria because we have no capacity to help them
1827769 our municipal budget went down from 165 million to less than 100 million in the past four years we have 70 percent unemployment since independence in 1943 no one has paid attention to akkar
1827770 ive now paid off most of my debts and have decided to move my family to syria
1827771 i want to enroll the children in syrian schools its much cheaper to live there and we can be treated just the same as everybody else
1827772 we are only at the beginning of the fire season now and we have already lost 600 hectares
1827773 this year could be bad especially between september and october
1827774 in 85 percent of the cases the reason for the fire is cited as unknown
1827775 be charged with taking legal action against those who perpetrate violations against the environment receiving and studying environment complaints and monitoring quarry mining
1827776 the issue was being studied with prime minister fouad siniora
1827777 i urge all municipalities to launch a workshop aimed at maintaining forests before it is too late
1827778 is the environment a priority for the lebanese state i dont think so because some people consider the environment as one of the countrys luxury issues
1827779 in the long term lebanon needs a national fire management plan and centralized decision making strategies
1827780 in the short term land owners and local municipalities need to maintain forested areas and the fire fighting capabilities of the civil defense and army needs to be increased
1827781 we got married in the tyre region of qana and today we will celebrate the baptism of our son on mount hermon
1827782 we have not even decided on a godfather we are going to choose one from the group here
1827783 this day includes physical and spiritual exercise at the same time
1827784 war has passed by this place will peace also pass by this area and dominate the whole region
1827785 he can end the war in iraq change the politics of the arab world middle east lebanon and palestine we need this we need peace he would make peace with israel and lebanon because we are tired of war every month every year
1827786 i have a great admiration for the american people for their courage and willingness to elect a black young man to the presidency of america which proves there is no discrimination
1827787 there was a small mistake in his speech when he won against hillary clinton and he mentioned israel
1827788 its a small mistake and we forgive him because we know the situation of the zionist lobby in america we hope he will repair such a mistake we hope to give palestine and arabs under israel their freedom and their rights to live as human beings if he can give palestine a separate state then that will be a great gift to the arab world
1827789 they have workers in their homes and they treat them badly but obamas coming from the us is a good thing if he was coming from africa or asia we wouldnt like him lebanese like him because he has power and money
1827790 at the presidential debates it seemed he was progressive and he knew what was happening in the middle east and that was important
1827791 we can say he has to appeal to the israeli and jewish lobbies but his discourse is becoming more conservative what stops him from catering to them after election for other agendas he may continue bargaining foreign policy for internal support and to continue domestic agendas
1827792 both candidates are faced with the same pressures at home they do not differ on major issues such as iraq or the middle east at large maybe they differ on the means but the question of principle and the issue at large they are both in the same trap
1827793 he certainly is a phenomenon but the phenomenon is not a judgement of what he will do
1827794 mccain continues the same policy bush and republicans have used since 9 11
1827795 iraq is more stable now i agree with more pressure on syria and iran he knows the enemies and calls islamists by their name for obama they dont exist
1827796 american policy is not going to change overnight what differs is your approach to things obama would slow things people like us have suffered a lot and new born democracies will suffer a lot if you give more time to syria there will be more assassinations in lebanon if you give more time to iran more american soldiers will die in iraq
1827797 talk is better than no talk but still if it is not conditioned and serious then it could be counterproductive and could send false signals
1827798 that could come at the expense of lebanons sovereignty and freedom at the end of the day
1827799 bush supported parliamentary majority leader mp saad hariri he also supported israels war on lebanon and part of the lebanese the shiites and half of the christians really hate him anyone who comes in is better than bush but people who supported hariri want mccain because he will be like bush and continue the same policies
1827800 the march 14 and march 8 coalitions have different views of support for who will lead the us one party was supported by the american regime in the presidency of bush so they would be happy with mccain
1827801 in the united states the future erases the past whereas in the middle east the past erases the future
1827802 march 14 has certainly made the most concessions as witnessed in the government composition where the opposition has been able to secure as many key ministries for its allies as march 14 which has parliamentary majority
1827803 march 14 is based on the principles of sovereignty democracy and self determination for lebanon
1827804 in light of what we have had to contend with in the last three years whether the assassinations mainly targeting march 14 members the sit in sabotage of the presidential election which was postponed for more than six months the may 7 clashes and the current continuous obstruction process the fact that march 14 is still able to operate is a miracle
1827805 the cohabitation between the state and hizbullahs armed organization is rendering the march 14 mission of nation building impossible
1827806 we need to focus our slogans and approach on the problem of hizbullahs weapons
1827807 in south lebanon the group established a fortified underground system that would be used to fight the israeli military armored corps and infantry troops that advance towards the rocket arsenal north of the litani
1827808 meanwhile the logistics and training center of hizbullah which has been boosted with thousands of new fighters is in the bekaa valley region
1827809 israel would not accept the establishment of an advanced anti aircraft system in lebanon should it be set up israel will not hesitate to act against it
1827810 northstar commuter rail has been a vision for 20 years
1827811 seeing this first locomotive completed is remarkable and offers one of the first tangible results of all the hard work poured into this project by its many supporters
1827812 nobody really knows las vegas except those who have walked the streets and spilled their eager heart on its gaming tables
1827813 hes not black and he cant represent me thats just the bottom line
1827814 it was dated and signed on april 23 but it has not been enforced yet
1827815 we are still in negotiations there are still negotiations with lawyer and also with our u s attorneys office the prosecutors
1827816 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen has nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and does not know where he obtained them
1827817 we regret that we will not have the opportunity to present evidence to the jury
1827818 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
1827819 the investigators looked around they decided they had to find somebody they went after all of them but he looked the most susceptible to pressure
1827820 it is like prisoners of war if they are harassed enough they will be driven to do anything but i dont believe he would have done what they say he did
1827821 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
1827822 intelligence suggests that a paedophile ring in belgium made an order for a young girl three days before madeleine mccann was taken
1827823 somebody connected to this group saw maddie took a photograph of her and sent it to belgium
1827824 the purchaser agreed that the girl was suitable and maddie was taken
1827825 we are disappointed by the decision having spent more than two years working diligently on a project which would not only provide everton football club with a new home but also regenerate kirkby we had hoped to avoid a government call in
1827826 indeed it was only in june that knowsley borough councils planning committee voted by a majority of 20 1 to grant planning permission
1827827 we shall now engage in detailed discussions with our development partners kbc and tesco to assess what options are open to us
1827828 it is important to stress that this decision does not spell the end of the destination kirkby project but it will self evidently precipitate a period of reflection assessment and re evaluation
1827829 a ground move is certainly crucial to the economic future of everton i have said it a million times that i love goodison park but we have to move for economic and financial reasons
1827830 we have to get more income into the club to begin to compete with those clubs i have been talking about
1827831 the eia data showing big increase in crude stocks are bearish but the gasoline numbers showing a much larger than expected draw is certainly bullish
1827832 i went over to the desk explained what i was wanting and what the case worker had said to me and he said no
1827833 i asked if there was any way we could sort it out and he just said eff off
1827834 he didnt say it he mouthed it at me which was real hurtful because there was a real smirk on his face right in front of my son i was so upset
1827835 even if i did which i didnt he should never speak to people like that
1827836 he actually said i called him a faggot which i didnt
1827837 even if i was in the wrong even if i did say that his job is to deal with situations and to deal with people who are like that
1827838 in this case it is an employment matter once all the facts are established and weve concluded the investigation then appropriate action will be taken

1827847 we are addressing them in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties
1827848 we are reviewing the draft rfp with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao government accountability office in a way that facilitates a fair and non political evaluation of the competing bids
1827849 are fully responsive to the gaos direction but i would not consider this to be a substantial modification to the rfp
1827850 weve tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the offerers have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements
1827851 we are dramatically ahead of the aggressive plans weve established
1827852 we stand by what we said in that we have to deliver the benefit to our shareholders and to our customers
1827853 on the listing side it has not been a good year for ipos
1827854 what we know is what weve seen in the first half of the year and weve seen record volume and volatility we remain optimistic that transaction volume will be quite high through the end of year
1827855 in good times and bad times transaction volumes tend to increase
1827856 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1827857 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
1827858 we didnt set out to make an nc 17 film thats just commercial suicide
1827859 they felt it was rather sexually graphic my point is it was comically graphic all the sex in the movie with the exception of one scene is very cartoonish very campy
1827860 anybody not inclined to see a movie with porno in the title is not going to see it so it kind of regulates itself to a degree
1827861 and anybody who is going is not going to be surprised by what they see
1827862 theres a line in the sand just below 117 if you close below that it signals traders are giving up on the bull market in oil
1827863 subsequent rallies may take us higher but the highs for the year have probably been put in
1827864 i think we need to drop another 30 or 40 cents a gallon before we really see any change in driving habits
1827865 this is one of several major medical fraud investigations that are ongoing
1827866 theres too much money being illegally stripped from public health care programs and the potential impact to those with a legitimate need is too great to let such fraud escape federal prosecution
1827867 this is a rather large operation they were receiving kickbacks up to 20 000 a month from some of these hospitals and they were delivering between 30 and 50 patients a month

1827870 given these new circumstances we are unable for the time being to devote the efforts that would be necessary to sustain any type of twinning process
1827871 this has been a relationship that was going hot and heavy and then died off

1827873 rail changes a community we look forward to the positive changes it can make in mesa
1827874 this is sort of the end of the line but for us in mesa this is the beginning this is the start of something great something wonderful
1827875 if you look at the mah building three floors are single rooms and there is only one kitchen
1827876 on each floor there is a washroom for men and a washroom for women that does not work for families or older people
1827877 the government finally took notice that there was something worthwhile to preserve
1827878 the dirty dozen are all extraordinary examples of chinatown architecture
1827879 in those days they had no chinese or even chinese canadian architects like myself they had to use the british architects who were greatly influenced by the victorian principles of the time and they would tell them what they wanted and the imagery they would bring to the table would result in these buildings that were unlike anything else
1827880 its not chinese and its not western its unique to vancouver and san francisco and a few other places because their immigrants are from the same area
1827881 in many ways a number of us would like to keep this character as long as we can and if we take anything from it we should extract principles from it such as the balconies and cornices so to speak and the verticality that has been emphasized with a lot of columns all these things are characteristics that i think you can gradually evolve into a more contemporary style and still maintain
1827882 chinese owners are very reluctant to let go of the ship so to speak
1827883 there is a long history of discrimination against the chinese it isnt their way to go outside of chinatown for any kind of investment
1827884 every day i have to climb up to the third floor theres no elevator here
1827885 theres no air conditioning but its cool in the summer because we have all the balconies its over 100 years old and it still stands firm its lucky and fortunate for organizations that have their own property
1827886 the main thing is to help them be able to hire a professional consulting team to work with them looking at what the vision is for the organization how they see the future of chinatown and therefore what kind of feasibility study they need for the building upgrades including structural and various conservation plans
1827887 through these initiatives these organization are a lot more engaged in the chinatown planning process i often say were not just planning chinatown for chinatown were planning chinatown for vancouver and chinatown is now working much closer with the vancouver community
1827888 we knew that the societies would need help and individually some of us may be able to do it but collectively were sure well be able to provide help for one another
1827889 were two years behind schedule and lots of dollars over budget but its a very slow process to do heritage correctly there are really unique challenges
1827890 to restore heritage properly you have to make a decision to leave dollars on the table every dollar you spend youre not going to get back a rental return on i think thats one of the biggest stumbling blocks on why so few heritage buildings are being done
1827891 the original owner was reported to be a very stubborn man and he built the building anyway instead of 25 feet the building is six feet
1827892 it has become quite unique and is an interesting building its been well restored by the owner and his architects
1827893 our family has always been in chinatown and worked in chinatown our business has been here for over 40 years this building is fun because we get so many people coming to see it though they often walk right by and dont realize its in front of them
1827894 people like to come in and stretch their arms out to see if they can touch each side of the building they assume its going to be crowded but are always surprised at the amount of space we have

1827903 the right of lebanons people army and resistance to liberate the israeli occupied shebaa farms kafar shuba hills and the lebanese section of ghajar village and defend the country using all legal and possible means
1827904 issues such as living conditions and salaries are urgent and need to be tackled as soon as possible
1827905 this government should be a foundational one as it is the first cabinet of the new presidential term
1827906 i advised him to do so last year and he refused i will not advise him again
1827907 the government is expected to win a vote of confidence very soon since the ministerial statement was unanimously approved
1827908 such negotiations can be done through jordan and france which is very similar to what happened before the un mediated prisoner exchange between hizbullah and israel
1827909 sleimans visit will succeed if assad fulfills his promise of establishing diplomatic relations with lebanon
1827910 assad made this promise before french president nicholas sarkozy at the mediterranean union summit in paris last month
1827911 the relationship between the state and the resistance should be that of cooperation and harmony in order to protect lebanon against israeli threats
1827912 we definitely need more power plants and need to modernize existing ones to meet the demand for electricity in lebanon we also need to secure energy efficient plants so that the cost is lower
1827913 our existing power plants can only deliver 1 500 mw of electricity and thats one of the reasons we reached an agreement with egypt to supply us with 200 mw of power
1827914 our plants are running in full capacity the previous governments did not do their jobs and thats why we still suffer from the rationing
1827915 we have to run on a multitude of energy such as gas fuel oil and other sources of energy
1827916 even if we have 2 300 mw of power stations in the future the country cannot use all this power at once we must make sure that that the power stations produce 85 percent of their original capacity
1827917 edl is going beyond the call of duty given the current problems they are facing
1827918 the technical losses are mainly caused by the outdated and malfunctioned transformers if 200 million had been invested to replace these transformers a few years ago we would not have such problems
1827919 a return to relative political normalcy should help to revitalize trade investment and tourism and increase donor financing
1827920 constitutional and security issues are likely to dominate the political agenda in the near term with electoral reform among the most pressing challenges for the new government

1827934 for by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves the gift of god not of works lest anyone should boast
1827935 all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work
1827936 trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he shall direct your paths
1827937 you were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires to be made new in the attitude of your minds and to put on the new self created to be like god in true righteousness and holiness
1827938 and let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as one another and so much the more as you see the day approaching

1827956 its all about being competitive but being in quebec is not a minus
1827957 we are well equipped and we have the capabilities of handling it but from a design point of view we would like to partner with somebody else because its a fairly major undertaking considering what we already have on our plate
1827958 we are pleased with our results for the first quarter of our 2008 2009 fiscal year but we are even more excited about the many important long term contracts signed since the beginning of the year
1827959 we have a portfolio of products that will allow us to maintain or even increase our military sales even if there could be some significant changes because of the new president no matter which one is elected
1827960 with its diversified exposure to both commercial and defence programs we view heroux devtek as one of the best positioned of the companies we follow
1827961 when it was approved our reaction was great it was amazing
1827962 but then when it was removed that was kind of a kick down we were a little upset
1827963 our view that the eurozone economy would fare relatively well in the global downturn has been undermined by the latest news on germany and the deterioration in the business surveys
1827964 it now looks likely that the eurozone will be the first major economy to fall into recession
1827965 the decline in oil prices largely reflects ongoing worries that oil demand has weakened especially in the us
1827966 as well it appears that tropical storm edouard has had only a limited impact on oil production in the gulf of mexico
1827967 it looks like moderate drinking has been increasing heavy drinking is down a little bit and total alcohol consumption is down a little bit
1827968 it is encouraging news that more people are drinking moderately and the average intake is coming down rather than shooting up
1827969 it generally tends to reflect trends within the country among middle class white americans
1827970 people drank about a third more back in the 50s and 60s than they did in the 70s up to 2004
1827971 at the same time theres been a decrease in beer and an increase in wine consumption among people but the average intake has decreased
1827972 the data are very clear that light to moderate drinking without binge drinking is generally good for health whereas a larger amount of binge drinking is bad it looks like in this population its going in the right direction
1827973 recent decades the messages about alcohol have increasingly emphasized the potential to derive both pleasure and health benefits from wine provided the dose is prudent the trends in this study suggest those messages are having an impact at least in framingham massachusetts among those not vulnerable to alcohol abuse intake patterns appear to be shifting in accord with expert recommendations
1827974 i think ssds will compete against express and the standard edition but for now ssds is targeting a different audience

1828011 we certainly do not believe that it is a foregone conclusion that it the dialogue is not going to be successful

1828124 interventions that have been created to encourage abstinence have treated abstinence and sexual activity as opposites however teenagers say they dont think of them as opposites
1828125 these interventions are less likely to work than more comprehensive sex education programs because they are not meeting adolescents where they are and they are speaking a different language
1828126 this paper demonstrates that increasing abstinence intention does not lead to less sex in fact when abstinence intention and sex intention interact with each other a teenager is more likely to have sex
1828127 our findings raise serious concerns about the abstinence only approach as a risk reduction method for adolescent sexual behavior
1828128 the united states has the highest teen pregnancy rate among developing nations and rates of sexually transmitted diseases in this country are high the risks are real and if people want to keep teens safe from the negative outcomes of sex abstinence only programs are not the way to go more comprehensive programs that include abstinence as one choice are much more likely to have the outcomes we want that teenagers eventually will be in a positive and fulfilling sexual relationship
1828129 abstinence only programs often only look at the negatives of sex not the positive this is especially important for young women who need to have control over having sex and having safe sex
1828130 with these programs you often hear sex just happens and adolescents are having less safe sex this detracts from adolescents having a choice and this leads to more dangerous sex with more sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancies

1828195 after all i have been told by many that it is my
1828196 an hr department not far from me feels that it should be playing the lead role in building an organizations corporate culture i take an opposite view feeling that the culture should derive directly from leaders and teams and frankly that when hr is in the driving seat it the culture thing usually becomes mechanical impersonal and uninspiring culture by numbers in fact

1828204 have experience in several products or services and a deep knowledge of customer needs
1828205 im still in shock this is historic news nobody believed anymore this would be possible i was sure karadzic was under the protection of the church
1828206 an important demonstration of the serbian governments determination to honor its commitment to cooperate with the international criminal tribunal
1828207 the arrest of radovan karadzic is confirmation that every criminal will eventually face justice
1828208 i hope that people who had to keep quiet because of karadzic will start revealing the locations of mass graves and let us find the truth about our beloved ones
1828209 this is a very important day for the victims who have waited for this arrest for over a decade it is also an important day for international justice because it clearly demonstrates that nobody is beyond the reach of the law
1828210 an important step on the path to the rapprochement of serbia with the european union

1828214 launched an aggressive campaign to prove that muslims had committed crimes against thousands of serbs in the area
1828215 was intended to diminish the significance of the july 1995 crime
1828216 i am sorry that as you put it serbs feel unhappy and angry however i dont think like that to me there is other side political side who thinks like that
1828217 we expected this everyone who followed the trial expected the outcome
1828218 i am sorry that as you put it serbs feel unhappy and angry however i dont think like that to me there is other side political side who thinks like that
1828219 and since i am a soldier i know that serbs true serbs who are also soldiers know well that i fought them fair and square on a battlefield therefore i dont think they are jelaous because of my acquittal they knew for a long that i was never a war criminal and that i was a soldier fighting on a battlefield for survival and nothing else
1828220 i dont think the bosniak defenders of srebrenica committed real crimes we were just fighting to survive fighting for our lives
1828221 criminal proceedings require evidence establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is individually responsible for a crime before a conviction can be entered
1828222 the evidence that naser oric is innocent have always existed and i think it is inequitable that he spent almost four years in jail
1828223 how could someone question the one who defended himself at the site of genocide
1828224 youre going to lose guys theres nothing you can do about it except get better
1828225 its a big loss i thought he had a chance to compete to be a starting running back one of the most gifted running backs that ive been around for a long time very similar to terrell davis when he came in so obviously hes got a set back that hes got to deal with
1828226 the donations are basically through and through illegal thats number one and number two is how the obama campaign tried to conceal it
1828227 they listed the campaign contributions as coming from rafah georgia they used the ga from gaza so it makes it look like its legal and then for the zip code it says 972 which is actually the area code to dial over to gaza
1828228 accept thousands of dollars beyond the legal limit and theyre also going to flout federal election commission restrictions thats very indicative of what kind of president obama is going to be
1828229 theyre not going to be worried about the details and they wont mind if they break the law to get to the final result that they want

1828242 where the agitation has been alarming muslims have been targeted by right wing hindu groups
1828243 the unfortunate part is that the government of india has been totally caught off guard and the situation has developed into full scale confrontations
1828244 they have let things worsen in jammu there have been no measures taken so far to contain the violence which has been exerted against minority muslim members and government property
1828245 on the other hand we have seen in the kashmir valley that the indian government has come down heavily on protests by muslims against the violence on minority muslim members which have been peaceful
1828246 in jammu they have taken a soft approach against protesters who are obviously a minority there

1828252 the acts of the dutch battalion are attributable to the u n and not to the dutch state
1828253 the dutch state made available soldiers for the peacekeeping mission to keep apart fighting parties the fact they didnt succeed does not mean they are liable for the atrocities

1828280 389 the same day one of the dutchbat soldiers during his brief stay in zagreb upon return from serb held territory was quoted as telling a member of the press that hunting season is in full swing it is not only men supposedly belonging to the bosnian government who are targeted women including pregnant ones children and old people arent spared some are shot and wounded others have had their ears cut off and some women have been raped
1828281 w e saw two serb soldiers one of them was standing guard and the other one was lying on the girl with his pants off and we saw a girl lying on the ground on some kind of mattress there was blood on the mattress even she was covered with blood she had bruises on her legs there was even blood coming down her legs she was in total shock she went totally crazy
1828282 habibovic saw at least one vehicle full of muslim women being driven away from bosnian government held territory
1828283 bosnian muslims bosnian croats and other non serbs were confined in inhumane conditions and subjected to intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering by beatings torture sexual assaults humiliation harassment and psychological abuse in camps police stations military barracks and other detention facilities
1828284 his arrest is another positive step in ensuring that those responsible for war crimes in the former yugoslavia are held responsible
1828285 we have been informed by the serbian authorities that stojan zupljanin has been arrested
1828286 the office of the prosecutor welcomes this arrest and the fact that this brings the number of remaining fugitives from four to three
1828287 its up to him to give the first reaction but the news is very good
1828288 the arrest of fugitives and bringing them to justice is good for everyone it is one of the forms of cooperation serbia has committed to so this is good news
1828289 zupljanins arrest is an important step towards serbias full cooperation with the hague tribunal which is the key to lasting reconciliation in the balkans

1828320 the crane wife 1 amp 2 steals the show on the second half of the album
1828321 i am a poor man i have wealth nor fame i have my two hands and a house to my name and the winters so and the winters so long
1828322 dont give a sh t about the temperature in guatemala dont really see what all the fuss is about aint gonna worry about no future generations and im sure somebodys gonna figure it out
1828323 really i dont care i really like him hes gorgeous
1828324 there are documents indicating that karadzic took about eur 36mn in a bag out of banja luka in 1997 first he took eur 14mn in cash from a safe in the rs national bank and another time he took eur 4mn more by then he had already been deposed and was hiding from the arm of international law
1828325 shortly after this interview dodik became rs prime minister but never launched an investigation into the fraud for which he claimed to have evidence instead he is now promising to help the karadzic family
1828326 investigators were looking at claims that the war crimes fugitive stole the identity of a man murdered by snipers in sarajevo who were under the command of mr karadzic himself
1828327 my brother was killed in 1993 by a sniper bullet when he went to collect humanitarian aid
1828328 this is amazing horrifying my brother was running across a street and the sniper bullet came from the direction of vrace
1828329 dabics id differs from karadzics only in the photographs of the two
1828330 mladic provided certain information about karadzic probably a few months ago in order to save himself
1828331 radovan karadzic and stojan zupljanin used the identities of dead people from bosnia herzegovina which means that someone must have helped them to obtain their basic documents such as their birth certificate while its a fact that someone also helped them receive serbian citizenship so there are a lot of questions that the authorities will need to answer quickly
1828332 well insist that the interior ministry provide us with comprehensive details of that phenomenon because the fact that both fugitives had fake documents issued in vojvodina police stations points not to an isolated problem but to a systematic practice
1828333 we call upon the european parliament to pronounce this day a day of mourning in europe to organise commemoration ceremonies in europe and to send a message that another holocaust and another genocide will never happen again
1828334 i know it is unlikely after this time i will find them but every time i hear of a new grave i hope that at last my soul can rest many bodies were burned or thrown in the river
1828335 the un will never acknowledge their mistake even though the crime happened on their watch before the eyes of the world
1828336 but we will not give up justice must be done
1828337 we should pray that sadness becomes hope that justice replaces revenge and that a mothers tears are a prayer for the tragedy of srebrenica never to happen again
1828338 we call upon the european parliament to pronounce this day a day of mourning in europe to organise commemoration ceremonies in europe and to send a message that another holocaust another genocide will never happen again
1828339 i would like to ask all serbian mothers and all serbs whose hands have not been stained with blood to stand by those innocent people and denounce the perpetrators
1828340 i would like to ask the serbian authorities to stop hiding the criminals and the serbian youth not to listen to them to come to srebrenica to see i do not teach my children to hate but to see people as they are not to ask them their name names are not important
1828341 i do not consider myself personally responsible for what happened
1828342 in 1905 george santayana wrote that those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it
1828343 today we are gathered here not only to pay our respects to the families who are burying their loved ones but also to remember the past in the hope we will never again have to repeat it
1828344 i know it is unlikely after this time i will find them but every time i hear of a new grave i hope that at last my soul can rest many bodies were burned or thrown in the river but for some families this place means that their nightmare is over one day it may be so for me
1828345 they killed him in one spot and then mutilated his body it was a crime on top of a crime when they find his head i shall finally be able to lay him to rest and i will have a place to lay a rose
1828346 we are still fighting to prove to the world what has happened here while those who are the most responsible for the crime are being rewarded with freedom
1828347 it was so hard when they informed me that my father has been identified

1828365 in theorie zijn we ervan doordrongen dat oudere werknemers waardevol zijn maar we brengen dat idee niet in praktijk bovendien is leeftijdsdiscriminatie zon subtiel proces dat je daar de vinger niet op kunt leggen
1828366 vanaf 36 zouden sollicitanten het druk hebben met huiselijke verplichtingen vanwege een drukbezette partner en kinderen rond de 45 zouden mensen zich steeds vaker laten leiden door zingeving ze bekijken het arbeidsproces daardoor volgens werkgevers te kritisch en 55 plussers zijn in hun ontwikkeling verwaarloosd zaten acht jaar in n vak zonder iets bij te leren hun afbraakrisico is groot
1828367 het zijn stereotiepe beelden over leeftijd die al lang niet meer kloppen maar waar werkgevers zich wel door laten leiden
1828368 als wij vier vrouwen van 40 plus naar een sollicitatie sturen en ze nemen iemand van 18 aan dan weet ik genoeg als ze ouderen een kans geven zien ze hoe gemotiveerd die zijn maar winkeliers vinden hen dan weer te duur
1828369 een jonge werknemer verlaat de onderneming na een paar jaar en neemt de kennis uit een binnen het bedrijf genoten opleiding mee een vijftiger zal eerder tot zijn pensioen blijven je hebt dan profijt van de investeringen die je in iemand doet
1828370 vragen wij een oudere sollicitant dan is hij vaak verbaasd dat hij voor een gesprek wordt uitgenodigd meestal vallen ze in de brievenronde al af

1828376 man that whole firing your agent thing must of been like tom cruise firing his publicist
1828377 it was proven at the international court of justice icj in the hague that the rs police committed genocide in srebrenica is it really legal for that same police who murdered our loved ones to handle security at the janazah in potocari
1828378 we are angry because of the numerous injustices imposed on us srebrenica survivors

1828388 i want to thank jim and everyone at guthrie racing for giving me the opportunity to run the rest of the season with them
1828389 we have talked many times since star mazda in 2005 and it is great to know i have a team that is capable of winning races behind me
1828390 we had a great run and challenged for the lead in kansas and i was running for a podium spot at mid ohio until we had some bad luck but i am looking forward to getting guthrie racing their first win since the 2006 season
1828391 i am ecstatic to be back in the indy lights series and working with team moore racing again
1828392 i am so thankful for this opportunity and for tom wood and mark moore going out on a limb to help make this happen i just cant thank them enough i think the best way to say thank you to them is to go out there and try to give tmr their first win im looking forward to going to a track where i know how to produce a stout performance

1828394 it was definitely a new experience coming from brazil where soccer is the top sport american football is something very new to me ive watched the super bowl before but after today i might have to start watching more football it was a great opportunity to learn about the game and see other athletes doing what they love it was good to meet with shayne and coach fitzgerald and to learn that they are huge racing fans away from the field
1828395 the success of the parliament today wednesday to approve the supplementary budget bill will contribute to revitalizing the iraqi economy and accelerate government efforts to provide services raising the living level of staff and implementation of investment projects great as well as solving the problem of displaced people widows and affected social groups
1828396 it was not possible to end the chapter without legislative approval supplementary budget
1828397 this is a turning point i think in the next 12 or 15 months that were going to make history were going to allow the nation of iraq to build itself

1828403 the international committee of the red cross has estimated that 7 079 muslims died around srebrenica some of these were civilians but most were bosnian muslim troops killed as they retreated across bosnian serb territory to tuzla the nearest muslim stronghold

1828409 ton zwaan a researcher at the amsterdam centre for holocaust and genocide studies believes that the arrest of the former bosnian serb leader will cast a different light on the dutch role in the srebrenica massacre
1828410 it will become clear that in this case the dutch at most played a supporting role and also of course that the international community left them in the lurch at the decisive moment it was never cleared up but there never was any air support and it will become clear who were the real perpetrators of this massacre
1828411 in this case the dutch at most played a supporting role
1828412 its more to do with negative dutchbat experiences after they came back to the netherlands

1828427 identifying and implementing educational practices supported rigorous evidence a user friendly guide
1828428 this guide seeks to provide educational practitioners with user friendly tools to distinguish practices supported by rigorous evidence from those that are not
1828429 if practitioners have the tools to identify evidence based interventions they may be able to spark major improvements in their schools and collectively in american education
1828430 this guide seeks to provide assistance to educational practitioners in evaluating whether an educational intervention is backed by rigorous evidence of effectiveness and in implementing evidence based interventions in their schools or classrooms
1828431 example the tennessee class size experiment a large multi site randomized controlled trial involving 12 000 students showed that a state program that significantly reduced class size for public school students in grades k 3 had positive effects on educational outcomes for example the average student in the small classes scored higher on the stanford achievement test in reading and math than about 60 percent of the students in the regular sized classes and this effect diminished only slightly at the fifth grade follow up based largely on these results in 1996 the state of california launched a much larger state wide class size reduction effort for students in grades k 3 but to implement this effort california schools hired 25 000 new k 3 teachers many with low qualifications thus the proportion of fully credentialed k 3 teachers fell in most california schools with the largest drop 16 percent occurring in the schools serving the lowest income students by contrast all the teachers in the tennessee study were fully qualified this difference in implementation may account for the fact that according to preliminary comparison group data class size reduction in california may not be having as large an impact as in tennessee

1828448 heres my energy policy barack wants to focus on new technologies to cut foreign oil dependency and mccain wants offshore drilling well why dont we do a hybrid of both candidates ideas we can do limited offshore drilling with strict environmental oversight while creating tax incentives to get detroit making hybrid and electric cars that way the offshore drilling carries us until the new technologies kick in which will then create new jobs and energy independence energy crisis solved

1828450 sen mccains new ad is straight out of the rove playbook
1828451 sen mccains campaign has decided that they cant win on the issues so instead theyre going to try to destroy their opponents character
1828452 it has the same purpose the intent is to attack character
1828453 this is very analogous to the windsurfing ad in 2004
1828454 in both cases you have the republican exploiting the perceived weakness democrats have in middle america with blue collar voters they reinforce the idea that democratic leaders are elites and not people that ordinary people can relate to
1828455 mccains paris hilton ad is funny and paris hiltons mccain ad is even funnier
1828456 theres a difference between humor and mean spiritedness in political campaigns humor works
1828457 i think it might have had some impact i think kerry probably created that image himself in his lifetime in politics he always seemed to be of the moneyed class someone who lived in rarefied air and that is somewhat striking given that he volunteered for vietnam
1828458 i dont think the mccain campaign so far has been terribly effective at this
1828459 republicans have been more successful in the past but democrats can be pretty nasty as can 527 groups
1828460 was an effort to paint him as old and out of touch

1828560 en ninguna otra situaci n como en el duelo el dolor producido es total es un dolor biol gico duele el cuerpo psicol gico duele la personalidad social duele la sociedad y su forma de ser familiar nos duele el dolor de otros y espiritual duele el alma en la p rdida de un ser querido duele el pasado el presente y especialmente el futuro toda la vida en su conjunto duele
1828561 todos o casi todos tenemos duelos sin realizar que se han ido acumulando con el paso del tiempo se relacionan tanto con la muerte de un ser querido como con una ruptura amorosa la p rdida de un amigo de la tierra natal de una casa un empleo o una empresa la llegada de la jubilaci n o la renuncia a un ideal profesional
1828562 aunque la sociedad nos apure y nos empuje a terminar r pido con el duelo cada uno lo hace a su modo vive su vida y sus sentimientos a un ritmo propio
1828563 el duelo requiere un trabajo particular y doloroso penoso y largo pero que cuando se termina
1828564 hay que empezar por aceptarse tal como uno es y no tal como se quiere que sea
1828565 para salir del duelo es necesario y vital encontrar nuevos recursos desprenderse perdonar aceptar la p rdida existen ciertas t cnicas que pasan todas por la misma ruta
1828566 el duelo es un proceso que hacemos todos frente a cualquier p rdida significativa que al mismo tiempo se siente una p rdida de seguridad no es necesariamente la muerte puede ser cualquier p rdida de un trabajo exilio ya sea elegido o no casa amor salud situaci n econ mica juventud los hijos que se van as como tantas otras p rdidas inevitables por las cuales nuestra educaci n en sociedad no nos ha preparado porque nos ense an a ganar pero no a perder
1828567 las etapas del duelo ya sea para enfrentar la muerte o una p rdida son las mismas son nicas porque dependen de la fuerza del v nculo puesto que el trabajo del duelo empieza con la ruptura de ese v nculo significativo y es en realidad la p rdida de un objeto de amor lo que las personas no se dan cuenta y es por eso que es un proceso que hay que elaborar y no tapar es que significa muchas p rdidas no solamente el objeto de amor sino tambi n una parte de si mismo y la p rdida de la seguridad todas esas p rdidas lo transforman en un proceso doloroso
1828568 creo que la receta m s importante es ofrecerse 4 placeres por d a como m nimo todos los d as la receta es 1 a 3 a os despu s uno normalmente ha tomado la costumbre y ya lo hace porque eso regenera da energ a y rehace al ser humano porque en el trabajo del duelo hay una gran cantidad de p rdida de energ a un gran cansancio interno
1828569 el proceso del duelo no resuelto es como una cicatriz que supura si el sentimiento es de serenidad paz interior entonces el proceso del duelo est terminado la cicatriz sigue existiendo es evidente que lo que nos ocurri nunca se borrar pero est limpia y uno puede ocuparse de otra cosa porque uno ya no est absorto por el dolor o preocupaci n
1828570 la verg enza social es la que tapa e impide el duelo y justamente lo que uno necesita es escucha sost n y poder volcar sus emociones venimos de una cultura donde hab a que callarse ser digno y no mostrar sus emociones
1828571 alice miller postula que es un empobrecimiento y no una riqueza porque todos los psic logos saben que la expresi n de los sentimientos y las emociones son indispensables para crecer y desarrollarse el cuerpo sufre cuando tiene que reprimir tanto incluso el dolor
1828572 la verg enza es social viene de los padres y de la sociedad hay una p rdida particular que a nadie le gusta hablar que es sobre el aborto muchas mujeres no hay hecho el duelo de abortos espont neos o provocados si uno no toma en cuenta esta p rdida pueden entrar en graves depresiones ya sea posteriormente o muchos a os luego de ocurrido el aborto

1828829 we all know that air quality has been an issue its been talked about very much some athletes knowing that hundredths of a second might be the difference between a gold medal and fourth place are obviously looking to take account for anything that might give them a competitive advantage but it wasnt the best judgment at the time the athletes understand that now

1828928 the tone of the runoff campaign for the 2nd district congressional seat has taken a highly negative and unacceptable path
1828929 our country is facing crucial turning points and the issues confronting america and the people of the 2nd district should take precedence over the attack ads

1828978 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me

1828984 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

1829009 who have incorporated basketball into their efforts to contribute to the greater good of society
1829010 the first analyst who actually dissected the game for viewers
1829011 with the relentless message of giving back sonnys years of work here and around the country has affected nearly a million kids and adults
1829012 a little man with a big heart who has made basketball practice for the real world
1829013 my family left us for dead but sonny literally saved my life by keeping me off the streets
1829014 and when i lost the use of my legs after a car accident it was sonny who stepped up and brought me on as a coordinator for the league
1829015 when he was a young man playing in the ebl i would feed him at my house because as a black he couldnt get served at the restaurants nearby
1829016 instead of getting mad he used basketball to give back he created solid citizens out of kids who might not have a had chance if sonny werent there
1829017 he was a positive role model for thousands of kids where there werent a lot around
1829018 sonny would use basketball to teach but reminding us that it wasnt always about basketball when youre a teenager from north philly it didnt always make sense but as you grow up it becomes part of who you are no one has made a greater contribution to the community than sonny hill
1829019 but even one on one there is no one more loyal than sonny whether i was looking for advise or just friendship sonny has always been steady as a rock
1829020 sonny hill or as i like to call him mr basketball has been and continues to be an incredible role model to thousands of philadelphians
1829021 i continue to be amazed at every philadelphia 76ers basketball game when players from both the sixers and our opponents all walk by sonny and say how much of an impact he has had on their lives

1829033 this of course is a bloggers nightmare enforced silence and the prospect of jail time
1829034 this is the latest of several reports here about law enforcement officials demanding identifying information about political bloggers a useful solution to the problem might be the creation of mandatory guidelines that forbid the issuance of law enforcement subpoenas for bloggers without the express involvement of the district attorney himself so that he can be held accountable when it turns out that the subpoena was issued irresponsibly
1829035 whats a bloggers worst nightmare it might be getting a subpoena demanding information that would help identify anonymous posters to a site it happened to ben smith co founder of room 8 a site where people post items about new york politics
1829036 hey where did you find that adorable little masi oka

1829042 arbitrators who may seek to develop reputations for being friendly to particular parties or particular industries may actually have incentives that cut against independence
1829043 the argument that aggrieved parties can always seek vacatur of the award is an inadequate response
1829044 parties to arbitration are not bound to any confidentiality obligation
1829045 many arbitration rules and some arbitration laws specifically provide for the confidentiality of proceedings and in addition the confidentiality of any award
1829046 arbitrations often take place under the guise of confidentiality so even assuming that a party were willing to undertake the investment of investigating an arbitrator the party may be stymied in its efforts to learn much about an arbitrators or an institutions reputation

1829057 even though we are making the right decision to lower the price of iphone and even though the technology road is bumpy we need to do a better job taking care of our early iphone customers as we aggressively go after new ones with a lower price our early customers trusted us and we must live up to that trust with our actions in moments like these
1829058 it benefits both apple and every iphone user to get as many new customers as possible in the iphone tent we strongly believe the 399 price will help us do just that this holiday season
1829059 if you always wait for the next price cut or to buy the new improved model youll never buy any technology product because there is always something better and less expensive on the horizon
1829060 we apologize for disappointing some of you and we are doing our best to live up to your high expectations of apple
1829061 i think its clear that apple was taken by surprise by the magnitude of the backlash regarding the price cut theyve responded quickly humbly and well to avoid letting this issue spoil the good news from their impressive product releases yesterday
1829062 while i still think the reaction to the price reduction was way overblown this is a great example of apple listening to their customers and trying to make the situation right
1829063 you just dont screw over your most ardent fans always a bad plan you may not pay for it intitially but you will long term
1829064 theyll get new traffic to the site and stores and almost everything costs more than 100 in any case so customers will be spending even more of their dollars with apple
1829065 i feel wronged and misled by apple such a quick price reduction indicates that apple pre meditated this reduction before the initial release i read your public response on apple com to this issue but i still feel that the solution you are offering is not adequate

1829068 wfp is grateful for canadas leadership in protecting our maritime lifeline from piracy this is a critical moment when more food is needed for a growing number of hungry
1829069 then we had a danish frigate then we had a dutch frigate which escorted ships sailing mostly from mombasa to mogadishu they escorted i think a total of something like 27 ships with enough food to feed a million people for six months
1829070 we have been appealing for anyone to step forward to protect ships carrying wfp food into somalia especially now because in the coming months we need to double the tonnages that we bring into somalia because the needs have gone up basically we aim to feed 2 4 million people by december
1829071 and then the ship itself has got not only its main armament but its got a boarding party that would be incredibly powerful in dealing with the pirate vessels

1829114 lehman will try hard to avoid the massive dilution that merrill lynch mer put in place
1829115 my sense is that lehman feels a need to take action now to stop for once and hopefully for all the constant stories and rumors swirling around the company
1829116 it is now possible that clients are thinking about their long term relationship with the company because the stories will not die these clients are becoming increasingly unwilling to make commitments for more than short term activities lehman must therefore act to solidify existing customer relationships
1829117 i do not know what the company is likely to sell how much will actually be sold and what the loss on the sale might be
1829118 my conviction is simply that the firm must cleanse its balance sheet of these securities to re establish confidence and it will do so no matter the cost
1829119 however be aware that the issue for buyers is what the longer term earnings prospects for the company are

1829127 we had only 97 lines for the call and they all filled up quickly this demonstrates two things first it shows how interested apis are in getting involved secondly it demonstrates that people want to engage in issues when the democrats do more than just go to people and say help us get elected when they actually ask people to discuss and debate issues it opens up a whole new universe
1829128 out of all the ethnic groups the api community is the most economically polarized
1829129 michael is the top staff person on the platform committee working directly with committee chair gov janet napolitano with over 1 000 platform meetings going on throughout the country it was a privilege for him to join us and great to hear him praise our efforts to focus on api issues
1829130 instead of an 8 page document that looks like it could have been written by any progressive organization or minority advocacy group why wasnt there more of a focus on just a handful of api issues that affects our community more directly

1829136 were very satisfied with the win and yes it was a dream start to beat the current gold medal holders and group favourites 2 0 is a fantastic achievement it was the first time ive beaten the usa as a coach and it was the perfect time to do it we may have had a bit of luck with the two goals but we limited the usa to a handful of chances and that was extremely pleasing for me

1829145 when you look up at the sky at night since ill be living on one of them since ill be laughing on one of them for you itll be as if all the stars are laughing youll have stars that can laugh
1829146 and when youre consoled everyone is eventually consoled youll be glad youve known me youll always be my friend youll feel like laughing with me and youll open your windows sometimes just for the fun of it and your friends will be amazed to see you laughing while youre looking up at the sky then youll tell them yes its the stars they always make me laugh

1829182 our new panoramic glass roof will allow owners to enjoy the outdoors year round from the comfort of their mustang
1829183 its one more feature that sets mustang apart from the competition
1829184 we want to offer this feature to customers while maintaining the quality and safety of the vehicle that weve been recognized externally for
1829185 being on team mustang is a special experience because we are all enthusiasts at heart and i was thrilled to be part of the warriors in pink project knowing that we would be contributing to the cure
1829186 the shock of my own diagnosis while working on this project highlighted to me how any of us can be affected when we least expect it and how important it is to work together to heighten awareness support the courageous women fighting the disease and ultimately find the cure

1829189 adverse economic conditions the company also faces more competition after dell last week said it may introduce a range of portable devices including a music player
1829190 due to adverse macroeconomic conditions which we see continuing through our fiscal second quarter and because we may be de emphasising some of our underperforming businesses we are projecting lower year over year revenues mr craig mchugh president of creatives us unit said in a statement
1829191 developing an accurate model of ice would help architects civil engineers and environmental engineers understand what happens to structures and systems exposed to freezing conditions
1829192 it could also help us understand and better predict the movement of glaciers
1829193 but they just stop where they happen to lie in different configurations throughout the crystal with no correlation between them and no single one lowers the energy enough to take over and reduce the entropy to zero
1829194 the original spin ice research went from one part of the periodic table to a more flexible one
1829195 but artificial spin ice goes off the periodic table altogether
1829196 it mimics the behavior of real ice but is completely designable with specific properties
1829197 we can change the strength of the spin or reformulate the alloy to change the magnetic properties which creates new bulk properties that we either couldnt get from normal materials or couldnt control at the atomic level
1829198 this is the first time the rules of ice behavior have ever been rigorously confirmed by directly counting pseudo hydrogen atoms
1829199 we can track the position and movement of each pseudo atom in our model see where defects occur in the lattice and simulate what happens over much longer periods of time
1829200 our meta material is very similar to patterned hard disk media magnetic bits used in hard drives are usually placed at random but memory density could be increased if they were in a tight regular pattern instead
1829201 weve found that both hydrogen in ice and the pseudo hydrogen in our artificial spin ice also behave as bits can carry information and interact with each other perhaps in the future engineers will be inspired by this in their hard drive designs the formal patterning and bit interactions may actually help to stabilize information ultimately leading to drives with much higher capacities

1829210 i think well probably do better because we know what to look for
1829211 now we know how hard its going to be also i think ill be a little less nervous because ive done it before
1829212 defense is our strength and we have some good offense we have different varieties of pitchers

1829214 he has the strength toughness speed and agility to break tackles
1829215 what he needs to do now is grow and understand college football and how to finish a run
1829216 that means turning a 20 yard run into an 80 yard run its not just about outrunning somebody its the ability to make that last guy miss

1829235 im thankful because two months ago my husband had a terrible bicycle wreck jims scrotum was smashed he was in excruciating pain and doctors didnt know if they could help him
1829236 every move caused him terrible pain doctors performed a delicate operation to piece together the crushed remnants of jims scrotum and wrap wire around it to hold it in place
1829237 jim is out of the hospital and the doctors say his scrotum should recover completely
1829238 ill give you 100 if you let me screw you
1829239 ill be fast ill throw the money on the floor you bend down and ill be finished by the time you pick it up

1829248 ive always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me
1829249 first you have to be single and second you must be catholic
1829250 i lied and i must confess that im married and im a methodist

1829259 i must say however that if they were left alone together my car would definitely kick your cars ass and your cute mini would run home crying little tears of washer fluid
1829260 i wish more than anything more than life more than the moon
1829261 lets talk ive heard that flights go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger
1829262 that could be an interesting topic but let me ask you a question first a horse a cow and a deer all eat the same stuff grass yet a deer excretes little pellets while a cow turns out a flat patty and a horse produces clumps of dried grass why do you suppose that is
1829263 do you really feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you dont know shit
1829264 my boyfriend came home found me in my leather and said youre the woman of my dreams i love you and then we made love until dawn
1829265 oh yes i met him in his office after work with just a raincoat on over my outfit when i opened that raincoat he didnt say a word we just made wild passionate love all over his office all night long
1829266 i sent the kids to moms for the night got myself ready but when my husband got home from work he just grabbed a beer and the remote control and then said hey batman
1829267 did you ever think that the only place a baby can get water is the toilet
1829268 since i must go to the city on business i authorize my assistant to buy monkeys on my behalf
1829269 my boss has collected lots of monkeys ill sell them to you for 35 and then when he returns you can sell them to him for 50
1829270 i must say however that if they were left alone together my car would definitely kick your cars ass and your cute mini would run home crying little tears of washer fluid

1829273 i must say however that if they were left alone together my car would definitely kick your cars ass and your cute mini would run home crying little tears of washer fluid
1829274 yes youre in a hot air balloon hovering 30 feet above this field

1829276 you dont know where you are or where youre going but you expect me to be able to help youre in the same position you were before we met but now its my fault
1829277 i must say however that if they were left alone together my car would definitely kick your cars ass and your cute mini would run home crying little tears of washer fluid
1829278 excuse me but can you tell me approximately how far it is from here to knoxville
1829279 well that change we made we didnt measure it because it was clearly the right thing to do
1829280 here is this problem heres what it means lets try to think up some ideas of how we can get better results
1829281 i dont think that our free shipping offers are producing enough incremental revenue to pay for the bill
1829282 a broad array of information diverts attention from the core offerings
1829283 having trash in her yard garage roof deterioration and exterior housing damages
1829284 the outlook for ship repair is extremely good at this moment
1829285 our marine business also continues to do well with its record order book
1829286 in singapore on a macro basis we are still continuing to improve the performance of our plants
1829287 the challenging global economic and financial environment creates uncertainty that may affect our forecast
1829288 some 85 per cent of our costs is in fuel so were exploring various types of alternative energy to reduce the costs of production and reduce costs for our customers
1829289 pdrm are currently in the quarter finals and the second leg will be played this saturday
1829290 the finals will be on aug 23 which means the latest we will be getting him back is still within the month
1829291 but of course it will also be determined by how fast his club can release his itc international transfer certificate
1829292 alam shah will provide us with another dimension and will certainly give opponents even more to think about
1829293 this is what microfluidics does best it enables smaller yet more powerful systems to be developed systems that may have been laboratory based can become more portable or even hand held and at the same time can have increased accuracy and repeatability
1829294 the real challenge with this project was the fusing of such large etched glass plates
1829295 aligning the plates to ensure the etched microchannels were perfectly matched took a great deal of experience and put our capabilities to quite a test
1829296 we are very pleased with both the progress of our development and the excellent support we have received from dolomite
1829297 dolomite has been very responsive to our demanding requests and has helped us make significant progress in recent months its clear from our research that microfluidics is very much an enabling technology for the next generation of environmental testing equipment it offers us an exciting step forward in providing in situ environmental monitoring capabilities with the possibility of more rapid response to adverse changes in air quality
1829298 god loves you and still wants you to be his
1829299 god loves you but that does not mean i have to
1829300 mike my father loves you but i cant i cant love someone who has been addicted to pornography and cigarettes so i wont endure calvary for you
1829301 it can be difficult to make arrangements because there is no singapore embassy in uzbekistan
1829302 so i think while there is awareness of the singapore brand of education the numbers here are small
1829303 we have received about 1 000 applicants even before we started any marketing efforts
1829304 our concerns were that we did not want to risk our reserves whether the school would attract enough students and we were also not familiar with the country itself
1829305 but the government agreed to guarantee our investment and they put in a us 10 million grant so financially it was secure
1829306 also they plan to give out 1 500 scholarships so the intake is also more assured
1829307 we have partnerships with universities from the uk and russia and adding singapore gives our youth a chance to broaden their learning
1829308 consumers are very price sensitive usually companies try to cut and match the prices but we want to be more competitive and give consumers the most competitive prices
1829309 pump prices move rapidly to reflect market conditions because singapores retail petrol market is extremely competitive
1829310 our consumers are very price sensitive our geography small and petrol station networks significantly overlap on another under such circumstances competition is so keen that esso is compelled to close any price gap very quickly
1829311 perhaps they are not in unison this time round because therapid drop in oil prices is sending a signal and there is no time to react in a unified way
1829312 youre here with me i wont be afraid youre right beside me every single day cus i need you here and i need you near walking beside me every single day youre here with me
1829313 there were other people at the beach i thought someone would save her but no one did a thing so i went into the water to take a look
1829314 i dont know cpr but i learned from the movies only once in biology class did the teacher teach us a bit about cpr
1829315 when she regained consciousness she wanted to go back into the sea as she said she wanted to follow the man she was crying and shouting
1829316 people have stars but they arent the same for travelers the stars are guides for other people theyre nothing but tiny lights and for still others for scholars theyre problems for my businessman they were gold but all those stars are silent stars you though youll have stars like nobody else
1829317 when you look up at the sky at night since ill be living on one of them since ill be laughing on one of them for you itll be as if all the stars are laughing youll have stars that can laugh
1829318 and when youre consoled everyone is eventually consoled youll be glad youve known me youll always be my friend youll feel like laughing with me and youll open your windows sometimes just for the fun of it and your friends will be amazed to see you laughing while youre looking up at the sky then youll tell them yes its the stars they always make me laugh
1829319 if youre just working on the technical financial points the social implications are out of the question
1829320 youre just dealing with how am i getting my money from here to there
1829321 i thought i was talking to you instead of debating john mccain but i am happy to let you serve as his proxy the fact of the matter is that i supported that energy bill saying at the time that those tax breaks were wrong but also recognizing that this was the largest investment in alternative energy in history
1829322 if he does really get behind this new compromise in congress i think that would be a huge mistake
1829323 we are disappointed to see that sen obama has expressed openness to compromise on offshore drilling and the health of our beaches
1829324 i served on that board for only a few weeks before resigning as soon as i became aware of public allegations against another member of the board
1829325 since concerns have been raised about that brief time i am stepping down to avoid distracting from barack obamas message of change
1829326 i actually consider this blog a money management blog i approach personal finance as it impacts our household our approach to investment is passive so you wont see me talking about that very much because we are confident on where we are investing our money my talk about debt is minimal because we dont have any credit card debt so that leaves me with our household expenses at the beginning of the year i committed myself to using coupons and tracking how much i save this year by using coupons along so yes my blog talks about that i also like to share money saving offers with my readers but in general i would say my blog is about how our family incorporates living frugally and shopping smart to thrive on one income
1829327 i have already charged that all men both jews and greeks are under the power of sin as it is written none is righteous no not one no one seeks for god there is no fear of god before their eyes
1829328 every one who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light lest his deeds should be exposed but he who does what is true comes to the light that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in god
1829329 no one seeks for god there is no fear of god before their eyes
1829330 i know that no good dwells in me that is in my flesh
1829331 for the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to god it does not submit to gods law indeed it cannot and those who are in the flesh cannot please god
1829332 you are not in the flesh you are in the spirit if the spirit of god really dwells in you
1829333 your choices are half chance and so are everybody elses
1829334 jag t nker inte cykla till jobbet den h r terminen heller
1829335 seeing your blog post about the chinese men buried at mt hope cemetery i was reminded of the article ive attached it comes from the boston globe in 1885 and describes chinese men flying kites at the new at the time franklin park i found it when investigating the history of franklin park for my jamaica plain history blog but i dont think i ever used it
1829336 what needs to be understood ingrid is i am a pastor thats my function in the body of christ whether im good or not people can make up their own minds im just stating a fact im using richard abanes
1829337 any emergents that deny the penal substitutionary atonement aka the true biblical gospel will have to try to save themselves based solely on their good works best of luck to them

1829351 doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results
1829352 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1829353 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1829354 now one of the things im proud of at the beginning of this campaign i said this is a different time this is an extraordinary time weve got to run a different kind of campaign so were not going to go around doing negative ads were going to keep it positive were going to talk about the issues
1829355 as somebody who has family living overseas who myself have lived overseas for a time i would be able to i think the world would see me as a different kind of president somebody who could see the world through their eyes if i convened a meeting with muslim leaders around the world to discuss how they can align themselves in our battle against terrorism but also put our the relationship between the west and the islamic world on a more productive footing i do so with the credibility of somebody who actually lived in a muslim country for a number of years
1829356 we are praying for obama because we feel he can help reduce the widespread stigma and misperception that muslims in indonesia are fundamentalists
1829357 there is no doubt that the new wave of attacks in palestine will wipe off this stigma israel from the face of the islamic world anybody who recognizes israel will burn in the fire of the islamic nations fury israel will burn in the fire of the islamic nations fury
1829358 america is sitting on top of a super massive 200 billion barrel oil field that could potentially make america energy independent and until now has largely gone unnoticed thanks to new technology the bakken formation in north dakota could boost americas oil reserves by an incredible 10 times giving western economies the trump card against opecs short squeeze on oil supply and making iranian and venezuelan threats of disrupted supply irrelevant
1829359 leigh price a scientist with the u s geological survey published a study in 1999 that estimates the bakken shales formation which underlies much of several western and northwestern counties may hold up to 400 billion barrels of oil by comparison the arctic refuge oil reserve is estimated at 16 billion barrels
1829360 the goal is to have every aircraft using synthetic fuel blends by 2011
1829361 by 2016 we hope at least 50 percent of this fuel will be produced domestically
1829362 americans will never hear about huge oil and gas reserves in the united states which if ever tapped would bring todays fuel prices at least as low as 1 50 per gallon and make america more energy independent
1829363 the big event in that three year period was in 1977
1829364 we have just drilled into the largest pool of oil in north america and in the world

1829377 khairul has just joined us a few weeks ago so he will need time to develop an understanding with his team mates and get used to changes in tactics and the different style of football we play here
1829378 khairuls a natural striker with a real nose for goal and i believe once he gets his first the goals will keep on coming
1829379 no disrespect to the young lions but i believe khairul will get a lot more chances to score now that he is here
1829380 of all those players only khairul is truly an out and out striker
1829381 if you remember weve been complaining from early on this season about our lack of a natural striker while our players have done quite well a natural striker would have put away more goals if you looked at the chances we have missed this season
1829382 the koreans are very strong but when we lost 5 0 to them in april we had a lot of injuries and were missing all our national players

1829405 we had suggested mediation over the length of his leadership but anwarul and leow didnt agree to any of our proposals
1829406 needless to say had the committee taken a different view we would gladly have stood down
1829407 the scc is a very civilised club made of professionals and they felt insulted that anwarul tried to stay longer in the post by using the clubs rules

1829495 we are pleased with the decision because we have worked closely with the clubs in this legal matter
1829496 it was always our opinion that under fifa regulations we were not committed to allowing our players to go freely fifa failed to realise the legal implications of this decision early and the preparation of the clubs ahead of the new season has been affected
1829497 since ive been back in iowa ive seen and heard first hand what producers need

1829504 theres not going to be a silver bullet to solve the problem so weve got to pursue multiple approaches
1829505 its very important to control the issues down at that scale where everything is happening
1829506 we continue to move forward in our growth strategy at a significant pace which is evident from our financial results and in our operational achievements during the second quarter im particularly pleased with the growth of the product and license side of our business up 46 from the same quarter of last year as a result of that strong growth our gross profit margins have continued to expand from 37 in the second quarter of 2007 to 41 in our most recent quarter we also strengthened our cash position with a credit facility which is expected to support our working capital needs as we execute our business model of developing and commercializing our market driven technologies into viable products and businesses

1829512 young singaporeans have a plethora of scholarships to choose from and thereafter many opportunities to pursue challenging and rewarding careers both locally and overseas
1829513 in this globalised environment where opportunities are aplenty we must impress upon young people the importance of the saf and the challenge and satisfaction that an saf career through the saf overseas scholarship safos can offer
1829514 without the saf the good life and the opportunities that young people enjoy would disappear like cinderellas coach at midnight
1829515 reached a level of maturity where often it cannot find ready made solutions elsewhere but must develop its own to stay ahead this makes talent even more critical to the saf
1829516 more than ever the saf needs leaders of the highest quality throughout the organisation who can think ahead conceive new ways of operating implement bold and creative plans and bring the saf to the next level
1829517 i have not made a decision yet but i am going to see how the military service would open me up to such a possibility

1829519 and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats
1829520 come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world
1829521 for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me
1829522 depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not
1829523 lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee
1829524 verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me
1829525 and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal
1829526 priest in the ordination he receives the power to offer sacrifice i e to celebrate the eucharist to forgive bless to preach to sanctify and in a word to fulfil the non reserved duties or priestly functions
1829527 and take thou unto thee aaron thy brother and his sons with him israel that he may minister unto me in the priests office even aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar aarons sons
1829528 if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law
1829529 seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever
1829530 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ
1829531 o love the lord all ye his saints for the lord preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer
1829532 paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ philippi with the bishops and deacons
1829533 for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints
1829534 and the lord added to the church daily those who were being saved
1829535 do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters
1829536 and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters
1829537 and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god
1829538 not all but still too many americans especially within the middle strata although not only there are in a real sense falling into acting like children easily distracted with toys here at midnight tonight the new i phone people will line up and fight each other to get in line to get the new i phone but they cant bring themselves to mobilize against the torture and the wars and everything else that is being done by their government in their name and right before their eyes this is not even really being hidden
1829539 refusal to resist crimes against humanity is itself a crime
1829540 i want to say just for the record that at times i myself have been acutely disappointed by and yes have cursed in graphic terms the people in this society who are sitting by and doing nothing in the face of atrocities and horrors committed by their government and in their name
1829541 as for people who are politically backward communists should not slight or despise them but should befriend them unite with them convince them and encourage them to go forward
1829542 a communist must never be opinionated or domineering thinking that he is good in everything while others are good in nothing he must never shut himself up in his little room or brag and boast and lord it over others
1829543 the politics of the possible is the politics of monstrosity to adhere to or acquiesce in the politics of the possible is to support and actually to facilitate monstrosity
1829544 maoists and iphones on new tech and blaming the people
1829545 but this verdict conflates mushes and confuses two things the willingness of the masses to act and their willingness to act along specific lines demanded by this small political group for communists to confuse these things is to lose the mass line completely
1829546 but if the likes of the rcp goes into the community suddenly without having any ties without really being involved in the struggles that people are waging i think this has more to do with them the rcp not having hegemony over those struggles and they would have to contend with different forces and lines
1829547 stop thinking youre the awesome shit and get down with people all people to try to figure out what is really going on and to figure the best way to unite with them and draw them forward politically
1829548 get the crap off your iphone and get in this protest
1829549 the politics of the possible is the politics of monstrosity to adhere to or acquiesce in the politics of the possible is to support and actually to facilitate monstrosity

1829575 my attorneys fees were agreed at 25 percent were earned at 25 percent and i request that your honor please pay these attorneys fees at 25 percent of my recovery
1829576 ultimately i believe that a deal is a deal i received what i bargained for and our outstanding attorneys should receive what they bargained for as well
1829577 although i approved the settlements i did so without being aware of the considerations that now impel me to disapprove them

1829590 akil bomani is a member of the chicago writers and artists collective and a correspondent to revolution newspaper
1829591 in the george orwell book 1984 it was the ministry of truth that was responsible for going through libraries and removing all references to unpersons and rewriting the historical accounts to line up with the new facts akil disagreed with the cult of personality and that was intolerable
1829592 stirring controversy wherever they spoke on the airwaves in house meetings and at a full panel discussion at cal state dominguez hills the rc4 kicked off their visit here bringing straight to the people the compelling vision of the communist revolution developed by bob avakian
1829593 bringing straight to the people the compelling vision of the communist revolution developed
1829594 the rcp had very little political influence and connection if any to the african american communities it was trying to reach we entered the communities as outsiders attempting to proselytize the inhabitants to become followers
1829595 but reading preaching from a pulpit of bones inspired me to do something that religion in general denounces think critically so i expanded my research i delved deeper into marxism and perused the bible further for myself to deconstruct all of the paradigms it had for so long instilled into me and so many others
1829596 in the george orwell book 1984 it was the ministry of truth that was responsible for going through libraries and removing all references to unpersons and rewriting the historical accounts to line up with the new facts akil disagreed with the cult of personality and that was intolerable
1829597 ive actually been learning some interesting things from this site so dont take this the wrong way
1829598 isnt what happened to akil and his involvement with the rcp on a smaller level not much different than trotsky being airbrushed out of old photos and even more extreme other old bolsheviks getting bullets in the back of the head
1829599 this is my stop this is where i get off
1829600 a thought experiment what would have happened to akil in stalins russia if he stepped out of line would that have been any different in the alternate universe where bob avakian was running the show in the u s stirring the hornets nest i know but it seems like an obvious point to me
1829601 if you are not with us you are sinister and irredeemable
1829602 it is worth noting that it is the kasama project that has consistently held to the principles and methods once upheld by the rcp and ba
1829603 the method of the communists around the kasama project stands in sharp contrast to the approach of the rcp today
1829604 kasama will hopefully become something concrete i can see that it is starting to take off in a good way while the rcp will continue their garbage about us and tell people they are the vanguard they will not change their politics but they will lose people akil is another one to the list

1829608 jika aku dapat yang lebih baik aku lebih suka menjadi orang kembar
1829609 aku tidak mengerti tidak mungkin seseorang menjadi orang yang berpikiran positif sepanjang waktu bagaimana kamu dapat melakukannya
1829610 tiap pagi aku bangun dan berkata pada diriku aku punya dua pilihan hari ini aku dapat memilih untuk ada di dalam suasana yang baik atau memilih dalam suasana yang jelek aku selalu memilih dalam suasana yang baik tiap kali sesuatu terjadi aku dapat memilih untuk menjadi korban atau aku belajar dari kejadian itu aku selalu memilih belajar dari hal itu setiap ada sesorang menyampaikan keluhan aku dapat memilih untuk menerima keluhan mereka atau aku dapat mengambil sisi positifnya aku selalu memilih sisi positifnya
1829611 hidup adalah sebuah pilihan saat kamu membuang seluruh masalah setiap keadaan adalah sebuah pilihan kamu memilih bagaimana bereaksi terhadap semua keadaan kamu memilih bagaimana orang orang disekelilingmu terpengaruh oleh keadaanmu kamu memilih untuk ada dalam keadaan yang baik atau buruk itu adalah pilihanmu bagaimana kamu hidup
1829612 jika aku dapat yang lebih baik aku lebih suka menjadi orang kembar mau melihat bekas luka lukaku
1829613 hal pertama yang terlintas dalam pikiranku adalah bahwa aku harus mengunci pintu belakang
1829614 kemudian setelah mereka menembak dan aku tergeletak di lantai aku ingat bahwa aku punya dua pilihan aku dapat memilih untuk hidup atau mati aku memilih untuk hidup
1829615 para ahli medisnya hebat mereka terus berkata bahwa aku akan sembuh tapi saat mereka mendorongku ke ruang gawat darurat dan melihat ekspresi wajah para dokter dan suster aku jadi takut mata mereka berkata orang ini akan mati aku tahu aku harus mengambil tindakan
1829616 dia bertanya apakah aku punya alergi ya jawabku para dokter dan suster berhenti bekerja dan mereka menunggu jawabanku aku menarik nafas dalam dalam dan berteriak peluru ditengah tertawa mereka aku katakan aku memilih untuk hidup tolong aku dioperasi sebagai orang hidup bukan orang mati

1829626 i dont think so growing up even though breaststroke was my worst stroke i was still swimming the event
1829627 the 200m freestyle in athens in 2004 i knew it was going to be a tough race but i didnt say no i wanted to swim it
1829628 then i got two tenths of a second outside of winning gold i like challenges and i knew it was going to be a challenge

1829644 we were in a tremendous financial burden after the incident as we had no sponsorship for years and our financial programmes suffered
1829645 we found that consumers can save a lot if they decide to breastfeed
1829646 it may affect the decision of the mother if she is earning a lower income or if she is cost conscious
1829647 through this survey we also hope to create more awareness of breastfeeding and encourage more mothers to breastfeed their baby
1829648 these mothers tend to return to the workplace earlier after giving birth as they usually have a shorter periods of maternity leave and their respective companies may not have proper facilities for them to pump breast milk
1829649 because of the health benefits it can bring to the baby not because of costs
1829650 gyms 110 per hour wii workout can ps3 or xbox boast similar claim

1829674 the debate about what counts as a living thing is fuelled today the discovery of a giant virus that itself falls ill through infection by another virus seems to suggest they too are alive highlighting how there is no definition of what is living
1829675 its primary purpose is to inform discussions and debates because frankly there has been a lot of rubbish about who can claim sovereignty over what
1829676 to be honest most of the other maps that i have seen in the media have been very simple
1829677 well i grew up quick and i grew up mean my fist got hard and my wits got keen id roam from town to town to hide my shame but i made a vow to the moon and stars that id search the honky tonks and bars and kill that man who gave me that awful name

1829682 i dont see any scenario in which mccain can get to the white house without carrying some upper midwestern states
1829683 ive never really understood in all my years why sen mccain has gone out of his way to speak against and vote against policies that are important to the upper midwest
1829684 the upper midwest is crucial in this election and midwestern voters value authenticity they value experience
1829685 i dont think agricultural issues are the only issues midwestern voters care about there are some bigger picture issues broader issues where hes strong

1829698 i dont understand the difference between the content producer and the standard video advertising model
1829699 how many of you plan to ask questions at the end of this
1829700 there has to be a way to get beyond counting clicks otherwise publishers wont get credit for their buying influence

1829706 he said he was not going to face the death penalty but instead had a plan to kill co workers and other individuals who had wronged him
1829707 an adequate explanation for his late laboratory work hours around the time of the attacks and sought to frame unnamed co workers
1829708 their tendency to spend the majority of their time sitting eating scratching and defecating
1829709 this is digg where pseudo intellectual liberals think they should excrete whatever bile they so desire
1829710 its definitely a struggle to get correct positioning but if theyre motivated they do what they need to do
1829711 their tendency to spend the majority of their time sitting eating scratching and defecating
1829712 additionally can you identify any actual inconsistencies with any argument for the theory of evolution instead of the typical strawmen and outright false claims that you have made in the past
1829713 because most of the attacks against my religious and scientific positions have come from atheists i figure that they have the least ability to tolerate dissenting viewpoints
1829714 i dont know what strawmen arguments and false claims youre talking about
1829715 that archaeopteryx was used as a promotional tool for transitional forms and exposed as a hoax therefore because it is not a transitional form is the fault of those junk scientists this fraud was exposed by other scientists in the field when they did more research on the subject
1829716 carbon dating is only accurate going back about 10 000 years
1829717 for something to be declared as a scientific fact it must be either observed in nature or reproduced under controlled conditions and subject to peer review
1829718 parts of that theory speciation and dna mutation do occur this is fact but speciation beyond the genus level has never been observed nor reproduced
1829719 thus the theory of evolution from proto bacteria to human being is just a theory please tell its supporters to stop presenting it as scientifically verified fact
1829720 speciation beyond the genus level has never been observed nor reproduced
1829721 thus the theory of evolution from proto bacteria to human being is just a theory

1829731 the kipunji is hanging on by the thinnest of threads
1829732 as health care moves into the digital age there are more and more companies holding vast amounts of patients health information
1829733 most people dont even know these organizations exist unfortunately the federal health privacy rule does not cover many of them the lack of transparency with how all of this works is disturbing
1829734 weve got to stop these practices before the marketplace is fully developed and patients lose all control over their medical information
1829735 to work the tool must be independent of all who hold the data
1829736 if you want a school well help you but you have to be willing to help yourselves you have to dig the foundation you need to carry the cement two hours up the donkey path
1829737 more people will be using computer read paper ballots than at any other time in the nations history
1829738 as you get more registered voters and more people in the pool it exacerbates this bigger issues of paper
1829739 after 2000 there was a widespread revulsion about paper everyone had the mental image of the guy cross eyed looking at the punch card ballot
1829740 but theres no silver bullet youre trading one set of problems for another
1829741 a lot of officials are in damage control mode because theyre going to try to limit the problems of switching to paper
1829742 you will have ballots not showing up being printed wrong the litany of mistakes voters make with these ballots and then theres incredible pressure in a crowded polling place for people who are trying to make their decision
1829743 paper is traditionally the device that the public is really good at screwing up
1829744 the depth is amazing so who knows what can happen when all those people come together and have a one off race
1829745 this charge is only possible on the orders from the prime minister
1829746 a man under siege and he sees no way out but to deflect the attention of the malaysian people with a sham trial against me
1829747 how could i insist that he be charged if there is no evidence the police are not so stupid to charge
1829748 this is not going to deflect from the kind of problems we have

1829773 the issue of economics is something that ive really never understood as well as i should i suppose i ought to understand the basics the fundamentals the vision all that kind of stuff
1829774 bush has made mistakes but the dems are largely responsible for the current economic problems
1829775 the war in iraq is funded by oil money it will pay itself off
1829776 worse off of course if i were feeble minded and tottering off to old age like john boy id be spouting the same kind of incoherent babble mccain lives in a bubble and doesnt even have a clue what a gallon of gas costs let alone what the lives of ordinary men and women are like
1829777 were going to arrest them and prosecute them to the max of the law
1829778 for beijing city a key variable for determining smog levels is vocs
1829779 if you cut the car levels without cutting vocs you can end up with the problem theyve faced in the last week
1829780 this car is nice really nice like why would we spend our money anywhere else nice its the cadillac of hyundais
1829781 if general motors would just make cars as economical as the japanese their problems would be over
1829782 i consistently believe that when it comes to african american issues or reparations the most important thing for the u s government to do is not just offer words but offer deeds
1829783 you need to make sure that your child can speak spanish
1829784 the led technology has the potential of replacing all incandescent and compact fluorescent bulbs which would have dramatic energy and environmental ramifications
1829785 yes burying billions of tons of co 2 is a huge job but that is not necessarily an argument against ccs you cant solve a big problem without a big effort
1829786 carbon sequestration is irresponsibly portrayed as an imminently useful option for solving the challenge of global warming
1829787 we have confidence that large scale co 2 injection projects can be operated safely
1829788 if their nukes melt down they wont be liable for the full cost of the disaster

1829790 id put my money on the sun and solar energy what a source of power
1829791 but its really incredible how long p v has been averaging a phenomenal growth rate everything we see says theres no reason that cant go on for a very long time
1829792 we are not that far away from a tipping point where energy from solar will be competitive with fossil fuels
1829793 researchers at caltech have calculated that covering a grid about 61 800 square miles in the central u s with solar panels would supply the entire country with electricity
1829794 this appears to assume a 30 year life span of the solar array which is longer than the guaranteed life span of the best roof you can reasonably buy
1829795 do for biodiversity what the printing press did for literacy
1829796 what the world needs is an economic superpower that represents the interests of the worlds poor call it pooristan

1829799 i just went to put my rubbish out and i saw these horses go running past me
1829800 they are going onto the grass and all the gardens are being eaten
1829801 no one seems to know where they have come from
1829802 we have rung the police but it probably isnt a matter for them we need a dozen specially trained horsemen to catch them
1829803 traffic officers have been in that area and are trying to find the horses
1829804 they caused an awful lot of damage before they were eventually led away
1829805 while blu ray discs offering both 25gb and 50gb are sufficient for users current demands we envision the need for a technology that can support far greater capacities as hd streaming in particular becomes commonplace and users build larger files of digital content the multi layered method is compatible with blu ray devices providing a long term future for the technology and is more easily produced when compared to competing technologies such as holographic storage

1829826 laboratories today need to do more with less yet maintain compliance with strict quality standards
1829827 artel now offers a hybrid solution that allows laboratories to maintain in house control over pipette calibration operations yet outsource labor intensive set up services and leverage the advanced liquid handling expertise that artel possesses
1829828 the pipette quality management system makes it even easier for laboratories to incorporate robust pipette calibration processes into their quality assurance programs
1829829 our new offering will be especially beneficial for companies using the pcs to calibrate pipettes in multiple laboratories as artel will assist with standardizing the calibration processes to produce comparable data
1829830 how does will the medical profession change who i am as a person
1829831 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
1829832 last year id watch the food network all the time
1829833 i think most wrestlers do most people take it for granted but when youre a wrestler you learn to appreciate it more because you really have to sacrifice it
1829834 i think girls get scared of eating too much but if you eat the right stuff and you treat your body good youll be all right its not like im shoving junk food in my mouth all the time
1829835 she was the biggest crab we wanted to kill her
1829836 they can focus a lot more of their attention and identity on themselves as an athlete not as a pioneer or a ground breaker i was all of those things but my love of it all was just wrestling its a great sport and all these girls will tell you the same thing its got all these other issues swirling around it but its this much of what we think
1829837 every article thats written about a lot of women is still about youre a woman in this guys sport
1829838 for me i feel like it gives me mentally a little bit of an edge
1829839 she looks like shed be terrible at thingy putting too
1829840 life is a bitch and she is back in heat
1829841 you just need to do something with that boonie hat crush it up or something it looks like you should be picking strawberries with that thing on
1829842 yo i heard that im not working in the opsec im gonna be out on the road
1829843 first i heard but not all the information gets pushed down to me kbr does all that stuff anyway so i wouldnt be surprised you are far too valuable to waste
1829844 what do you have that very few other people have
1829845 exactly you can search people i cant now when you finish that cigarette go put your patrol cap on that boonie hat is killing me
1829846 can you guys lend me some money for suckers that are just disguised hardened jelly
1829847 thinking that she had explosives and would attack them as a suicide bomber shot her and took her
1829848 we stand by the facts as alleged in the criminal complaint filed in court
1829849 in addition suggestions that siddiqui has been in u s custody for five years are not accurate she was detained on july 17 2008 as alleged in the criminal complaint
1829850 obviously she was arrested in 2003 but we dont know at what stage she was handed over to the americans
1829851 it is a little ironic that while the government is trying to prove the military commissions process is legitimate in the hamdan trial that the next person they arrest immediately goes into the federal court system
1829852 in some ways using a criminal approach has become easier
1829853 there have to be some places on the planet where you dont go for energy production
1829854 they have taken natural landscapes and turned them into industrial sites
1829855 the coalition gives us the chance to increase the volume and to represent ourselves as mainstream
1829856 i dont think this can go ahead this area is far too valuable there is a saying in business if you want to make omelettes you have to break eggs we dont want to be those eggs
1829857 the stone age did not end for the lack of stones
1829858 the object of this battle is an austria sized swath of mountains coastal plain and tundra bordering the arctic ocean in northeastern alaska
1829859 the area of anwr in question is roughly the size of the dulles airport complex in washington d c it is a flat bleak narrow section of coastal mud flat that is frozen and windswept most of the year
1829860 there are magnificent caribou and wolves and bears and porcupines and birds all through alaska you can see them thriving today as you could in the 1960s before pipelines were built talk about coexistence weve got grizzlies roaming on the pipeline and caribou migrations passing underneath it when people visit prudhoe bay on the north slope they appreciate how alaskas resources go from the ground to the pipeline to the lower 48 but they also get to learn about arctic wildlife because its right there its thriving and we work hard to responsibly develop resources so that will always be the case our mantra is develop responsibly and as governor i have to do more than talk i have to walk the walk
1829861 this is a small step for me but a giant step for mankind
1829862 mr gandhi dont you want india to reach the same level of prosperity as britain
1829863 it took britain half the resources of the planet to get where it is how many planets will india require
1829864 look weve got to get off this path its going to create havoc if we dont make some major changes
1829865 its own principles of scientific integrity whenever political direction from other federal entities or private sector interests so direct
1829866 the problem is not just that they put these panels together outside of faca outside of that statutory protection
1829867 the disclosures are late never publicized and conflicts are waived all the time

1829869 sliding software prices have damped the halo effect many music and software companies expected from selling their products through apple inc s aapl iphone software store
1829870 the los angeles based company thought it would have trouble getting customers to buy an iphone version of its popular
1829871 so on monday jirbo did what many other iphone software writers are doing it dropped its price by two thirds software makers are finding competition so fierce that theyre slashing prices over the last two weeks prices on hundreds of programs were slashed
1829872 the price cuts also could put pressure on apple although the cupertino calif based company sees the app store as a marketing tool it believes the more software thats available the more iphones it can sell the company still keeps 30 of every dollar spent on the download site if revenue drop precipitously the results may be more disappointing than initially expected on the business
1829873 just like itunes store makes ipod more attractive the app store exists to make iphone and ipod touch more attractive to customers
1829874 apple isnt limiting its sales to software programs it also is selling full length songs for the iphone only through its itunes store the virtual record shop that helped turn the ipod mp3 player into the benchmark for the mobile music player market apple did that by linking all sales of online music compatible with the ipod to the store in expanding that model to the iphone apple is already generating a backlash music companies are locked into apples platform limiting the avenues for digital distribution
1829875 apple has an iphone choke hold on mobile music delivery said one music industry executive who asked not to be named
1829876 even if revenue from the app store falls apple will be able to ride it out because it will become so popular and pervasive said gartner analyst mike mcguire
1829877 ride what out see first take and last sentence of previous take the app store exists to help sell iphones ipod touches and future products not to generate a profit
1829878 if he does order a suit theyll tell us at the last minute they always keep these things quiet
1829879 i think its such a politically charged topic what do you do with these exotic animals
1829880 theres never been any problem with them mistreating the animals or problems with the enclosures
1829881 if theres going to be more regulations put someone on the job who knows what theyre doing
1829882 allowing it to enter the enjoining enclosure and kill an adult female tiger

1829886 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1829887 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1829888 there has been a lot written about this coming conflict but it is largely based on rather poor geographic information
1829889 we wanted to give a clear visual guide to what the situation really is
1829890 a bunch of dorky kids with goofy smiles and terrible dress sense
1829891 through the no cussing challenge i realized that i could use positive peer pressure on my friends if my friends could say no to cussing how much easier will it be for them to say no to drugs violence and pornography

1829897 that brain chunk should leave a gooey splat when it bounces on the ground
1829898 the one question we get asked frequently is when are you opening on the westside
1829899 the time is right for us to expand now we will now be convenient no matter where you live in albuquerque or rio rancho
1829900 when the glass and the rock have a fight its going to be bad for the glass
1829901 the biggest debates were about whether global warming was real and whether or not it had already begun
1829902 as the bush administration starts to pass from the scene
1829903 one degree was enough to yield major effects in hydrological cycles in the progress of the seasons in the spread of mosquitoes in the rapid melt of glaciers
1829904 as temperatures warm snow at the very top of that ice sheet is turning to water and that water in turn is finding its way through cracks and fissures to the base of the ice sheets where it can grease the skids for their slide into the ocean
1829905 the terra preta trick was one of turning waste into resource
1829906 in a world where matters of faith seem so often and so tragically to divide us there is no issue which aligns us more deeply than our shared dependence upon and sacred responsibility to this tiny planet enfolded within its fragile atmosphere spinning in the vastness of time and space
1829907 your premise that those who love the planet do not love their fellow man and are willing to doom them to save the planet is false
1829908 major effects in hydrological cycles in the progress of the seasons in the spread of mosquitoes and in the rapid melt of glaciers
1829909 as we all know the balanced manner with which the people of past and currently modern developing country humankind lived with their faming technique and population growth management and self identification of their role in their environment i e the world was sustainable our current model is not

1829911 unlike other tropical areas in the world that are also undergoing rapid deforestation amazonia could release much larger amounts of gases in the future because there is still so much forest left to clear this is part of a vicious cycle set in motion by global warming especially because of its role in triggering more damaging el ni o events these cause amazon forest trees to die from drought and fire releasing gases that lead to more warming and still more dead trees emissions from dying trees and warming soils could contribute to a runaway greenhouse effect
1829912 we see soy prices going up partly because less soy is being grown in the u s as corn expands to meet the surging demand for the emerging ethanol industry
1829913 similarly as sugar cane expands in southern brazil soy production is heading northward encroaching on the amazon
1829914 although these fires appear relatively innocuous they are actually very destructive as most rain forest trees have a low tolerance of heat
1829915 and their slow speed means that flames stay in contact with trees for long periods of time as a result even low intensity fires kill up to 40 percent of trees
1829916 the hadley model points to the end of the century when there will be a big forest dieback in the amazon
1829917 but before global warming is going to kick in there is going to be all sorts of damage from the droughts we are already seeing as well as deforestation logging and the fires that are part of that regime

1829927 continuing investment in biometric technology and enhanced security measures will help ensure that passport security is maintained now and in the future
1829928 were not claiming that terrorists will be able to do this to all passports today or that they will be able to do it tomorrow but it does raise concerns over security that need to be addressed in a more public and open way
1829929 my pop always said any one cant find work they aint looking hard enough
1829930 yeah me neither unless youre into that whole 40 hours a week thing

1829937 dont get weird piercings or tattoos on your face or arms either in fact do yourself a favor and dont get any tattoos or piercings until youre in your second year of college the trick here is to be employable

1829941 he boomers gave us reagan and a 3 trillion dollar national debt the gen xers gave us bush and a 9 trillion dollar national debt
1829942 this generation of adults is also the most technologically sophisticated to date
1829943 i cant invest in anything now because the return interest rates for investments are far smaller than the usury on credit
1829944 they go in with the idea they can do anything and will have a job handed to them when they earn the roll of toilet paper with the words bachelors of written on it guess what thats a pipe dream it takes a lot of work and a lot of time to get a decent job
1829945 if you chose to focus your energies in a degree program that has niche marketability at best its your own fault for failing in life
1829946 hey you pay 20k a year for a state college education and guess what you are owed a 65k salary
1829947 you do realize that adjusted for inflation you were making considerably more than i am now
1829948 today people in their 20s and 30s are more educated than ever before some 85 of those aged 25 and older hold a high school diploma and 27 have a college degree
1829949 also student loans i know some very smart people with over 100k in student loans what the are you thinking
1829950 i dont want to work in a steel factory for the next 40 years

1829953 do for biodiversity what the printing press did for literacy
1829954 the first butterfly two months ago the other just two weeks ago
1829955 it will do for biodiversity what the printing press did for literacy
1829956 what bit of biodiversity is biting them appealing to them worrying them
1829957 it occurred to me that if the retail industry can use a few numbers to represent a vast array of products why cant we look at dna the same way
1829958 there was a lot of skepticism that we could deliver something that actually works
1829959 were sitting at 35 000 species and feeling pretty happy about that
1829960 i do not like it or not like it it is where i live
1829961 ten or twenty years ago students would graduate and simply be allocated to a job
1829962 everything was set even the time when one could marry
1829963 civil society is now a phrase people in china are beginning to understand
1829964 the first step is access to environmental information without information there can be no meaningful public involvement
1829965 do for biodiversity what the printing press did for literacy
1829966 as an electric wire gets plugged into a lump of coal and the narrator intones
1829967 with even lower emissions including the capture and storage of co 2 its a big challenge but weve made a commitment a commitment to clean
1829968 over 150 000 community leaders from all across the country
1829969 and we would hope that a new administration would say this is one of our highest priorities thats key language
1829970 implement a cap and auction system involving the 2 000 first providers of fossil fuels to achieve carbon pricing in 100 percent of the economy
1829971 direct epa to regulate emissions immediately under the clean air act
1829972 first because thats the way you influence policy and second because i think the people involved in the project feel a degree of extreme urgency
1829973 i think you might get a slightly better bill if you wait but not enough better to warrant it
1829974 the longer you wait the more you actually have to do
1829975 the new administration has got to jump into this in a very significant way
1829976 with a lot of bilateral meetings and a lot of attempts to show a different face
1829977 the urgency of this issue demands a president willing to make the low carbon energy challenge a top priority in the white house a centerpiece not only of his or her energy policy but also of his or her economic program
1829978 should be to support the president in preparing energy legislation for delivery to capitol hill within 60 days of the inauguration
1829979 probably the most important thing the new president could do right away is to commit to engage with other nations toward coming up with a post kyoto agreement at the end of 2009
1829980 that would send a signal that the days of denial are over
1829981 the next administration has really got its work cut out for it it will have no margin for error its got to move more quickly insightfully creatively than probably any government has ever had to move in recorded history
1829982 i think gore has it right this is a global emergency you get it right in very quick order or theres going to be hell to pay
1829983 the evidence as far as i can read is that the science is coming in worse and worse almost weekly and the more we know the less we like what we learn that doesnt seem yet to have penetrated this kind of bullet proof political system we have
1829984 it will get united states back to the preeminence position in the world as she were during world two it will make the next president the fdr of the 21st century it may even make he or she the next christ on earth again
1829985 polar cities danny first we need greenhouse gas standards for vehicles then pcap plans and maybe in after a hundred years if we have be totally ineffective by then we can debate moving to the poles

1829987 create a new national energy council lead by a national energy advisor
1829988 since 1975 the energy required to produce a given amount of output in the united states has fallen by about half
