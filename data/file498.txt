4980051 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4980052 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it

4980059 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
4980060 all of a sudden youve got outside groups making allegations while the candidate can say oh i dont know anything about that i had nothing to do with it while theyre in the back room cheering
4980061 it clearly is a disruptive force and it adds another element of uncertainty
4980062 you are always trying to game out what the other side may do and then youve got these third and fourth parties in the conversation too
4980063 you have people who have come out of the same political school so they tend to look at things the same way
4980064 still you always sort of suspect that maybe in the back rooms in the dead of night theres a little bit of communication going on

4980089 assuming we win the vote the next vote will be on the contract
4980090 the company gave them a 5 percent pay raise but took it out of the workers profit sharing so the cost to the company is neutral
4980091 if people are comfortable having their compensation based on how much the company makes theyll want profit sharing but if they want it based on if they come to work every day and do their work theyll want the incentive pay
4980092 we intend to win the decertification vote and then vote on the contracts ratification
4980093 if it doesnt pass well continue to bargain until we get a contract people will accept
4980094 it should be no surprise that sen landrieu is siding with not only the extreme left but the communist party in pledging to carry out the anti democratic bidding of labor union bosses lopsided campaign contributions from big labor to the left translate directly into votes as not one democrat in the senate opposed this measure which strips the private ballot voting right of the american worker
4980095 senator landrieu is proving to the american worker that big labor trumps worker privacy by voting to trample on the rights of the american worker
4980096 card check makes employees vulnerable to union threats and their families targets of discrimination by organized labor landrieu should have to answer to louisiana workers
4980097 clearly sen landrieu the other senate democrats and the communist party have a different view for the future of america
4980098 they want to send a message to the business community that theyre going to play hardball on this
4980099 we have a pretty rickety national economy and what we need to do is come together
4980100 its fair to say that colorado will be the center of ballot initiative world in november
4980101 the business labor ones likely will be the biggest most bitter and hard fought ballot fight in the country
4980102 coloradans appreciate and love their freedoms and thats the main thrust of amendment 47
4980103 if people break the law they should be held responsible
4980104 this isnt the focus what most das are doing today
4980105 youre not making colorado a very attractive place to do business
4980106 im not sure that colorados economic development campaign is come to colorado we love corporate fraud
4980107 the international knew that there were allegations of impropriety many years ago this is not news to them

4980110 the real question is will the union be weakened by this if the seiu cleans house and does whats necessary the union can continue to thrive
4980111 youve got a bunch of big corporations targeting democratic candidates running for senate
4980112 theyve put a lot of money behind these ad campaigns in our state theyre spending upwards of 800 000 bashing tom allen unions and maine working people its a total insult and a slap in the face
4980113 senator collins campaign has nothing to do with these ads which are apparently running in several cities around the country
4980114 senator collins has always denounced third party ads like these and continues to believe that they should have no place in maine politics
4980115 we felt it is important in that there is an opportunity to educate maine citizens there is a threat to private ballot election whoever gets elected to the senate allen or collins it is likely next year they will be faced with how to vote on this issue
4980116 just as every member of congress is elected by secret ballot she believes that employees should have the same right when it comes to determining union representation
4980117 try to wear people down so they never do it
4980118 whenever the olympics come around we always mention it its a pretty amazing thing
4980119 were very proud of him we were always very proud of him
4980120 its one of the first trophies uncle duncan won as an athlete
4980121 we are not quite sure what he won it for its been a treasure in my parents home and my aunts home and now i have it
4980122 i think he may have had to fudge his age at some point in time because we came across so many dates but we went with what was in the parish records
4980123 at the time he was considered one of the greatest athletes of his day
4980124 before the 1912 olympics the new york times did a profile on athletes to watch at the stockholm olympics the only canadian mentioned was duncan gillis and that is why he carried the flag
4980125 were just a small community and when someone from here does well we just latch onto it
4980126 we came out of the stadium just absolutely stunned at the magic and completely inspired at the opportunity that we have to go off and think and dream
4980127 our goal of course will be to be just as inspiring
4980128 despite the heat and humidity the entire stadium was riveted
4980129 they couldnt have done a better job i dont think
4980130 were still in the planning phase for sure but thats why this is so critical to learn the lessons that we see in beijing to make it a better experience here in vancouver for 2010
4980131 id like the world to feel think they know a little more about canada as our opening ceremonies close
4980132 its canadas olympics its canadas opportunity to remind the world what were going to be in the 21st century
4980133 the amount of effort it takes behind the scenes to move performers in and out of their positions the amount of volunteers and staff thats required to do that behind the scenes is incredible
4980134 ive done some pretty big rock shows but were way behind this stuff believe me this is mind boggling
4980135 in his world theres no greater audience no greater opportunities and no greater pressure its a one shot deal
4980136 i would say the brand to this day is very important but we saw a decline in sales last year so there has been the concern that there are cracks in the foundation for ea sports
4980137 i knew that i had to set the pace set the tone and make sure that i wrestled my match and not just wait around to see what she was going to do
4980138 i was just thinking how proud i am to be canadian
4980139 and i was just thinking about the road to how i got here its been a long one but a good one
4980140 to see her on the world stage and just doing what she can do and showing everyone it was really emotional
4980141 i won a match to get the bronze and youre losing a match to get the silver
4980142 each day our athletes exhibit dignity respect and dedication to their sport and to their country
4980143 their commitment to excellence and to achieving the olympic dream truly makes them great sport ambassadors for canada
4980144 its never time to modify the medal projection until the gun goes at the end of the games
4980145 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team

4980152 the board of directors and management staff of cornerstone provide all employees with a fair wage and benefits package
4980153 as a member owned credit union we must also maintain a fiscal responsibility to our members as stewards of their assets
4980154 dont make up for the difference if people need to buy into the desirable plan
4980155 the opeiu is seeking a fair deal that allows the workers to experience a wage and benefit package that helps to meet the ever increasing costs of living and burdens of health care
4980156 i should say that this person would be glad to be rid of you

4980161 kishore you must understand we were massively attacked on 9 11 it is true that america was attacked but the fact that the beacon of freedom and democracy could retreat in many areas of human rights after one attack showed how fragile americas commitment is to some key human rights principles by contrast the second country to be attacked after 9 1 1was indonesia lt took place one year later on 12 october 2002 in bali despite this indonesia did not retreat indeed even though indonesia had gone through a wrenching financial crisis in 1998 and 1999 which caused the economy to shrink significaitly and even though it had experienced a lot of social and political turmoil as a result of this financial crisis indonesia went steadily a head in its advance toward democracy remarkably less than 10 years after this huge financial crisis freedom house declared in a global survey entitled freedom in the world
4980162 is the most capable focused and internalionalist of the post soeharto presidents
4980163 his record of leadership is unlikely to be beaten over the next decade or so

4980165 whichever way you measure it the events in china are really remarkable chinese out put per worker grew annually at 7 8 and is 2 8 faster than the second country
4980166 concern for the overall social order led officials to be sensitive to problems of inequality early in the process of industrialization and to make efforts to spread income opportunities to all parts of society
4980167 has taken more of a leadership role than his predecessors in the counter corruption drive his official approval and encouragement have created something of a virtuous circle of reinforcement and political probity
4980168 rent income to ensure that their privileged positions are not
4980169 both leaders welcomed the ceasefire agreement and expressed hope russian troops would withdraw quickly from georgian territory
4980170 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4980171 we want them the russians out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometre of its sovereign territory never ever
4980172 has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4980173 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4980174 in miltons view not all members of a society are fit to participate in the political sphere
4980175 indeed sin can become so corrosive that it divests human nature entirely of its rights
4980176 milton believes unreservedly in the innate rights that belong to human nature as a result of creation
4980177 when an action is rationally justified how can reason deny its legitimacy
4980178 this revision of the academic understanding of technology contributes to weakening technocratic rationales for public policy a new era of technical politics has begun
4980179 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4980180 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4980181 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4980182 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4980183 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
4980184 hey i have a good feeling about this 400 car that i can give away if it doesnt work out
4980185 yeah we all want rear wheel drive cars and trucks but with gas at four bucks a gallon rear wheel drive vehicles are a waste
4980186 someday youll meet a girl youll meet the one youll know when it happens and itll just happen
4980187 ill set you free then ill love like im not hurting in the worlds worst ways
4980188 its becase we didnt have any money back then when i was her age
4980189 only a life lived for others is worth living at all
4980190 a friend is always loyal and a brother is born to help in time of need
4980191 the great thing about getting older is that you dont lose all the other ages youve been
4980192 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
4980193 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4980194 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4980195 we have no guarantee that the russians will keep to their agreement
4980196 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4980197 its a first game of the season and we had a physical match on the wednesday night and i was a little bit worried before that we would not be very sharp but we started well and were in control and we just couldnt finish them off
4980198 you have that old story that you feel you probably deserved to be punished in the end but i am pleased we did not let in a goal
4980199 when everybody is here we can create more clear cut chances because today the final ball was not good enough
4980200 but overall it has been a good week for us
4980201 is a trophy to finish 12 and win the carling cup not for me
4980202 you see the quality of a team after 38 games
4980203 in the carling cup or the fa cup you play five games in the final and could be drawn against second division teams
4980204 but you have no quality and are not there at the end of the championship
4980205 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title
4980206 if you dont win it of course you are frustrated
4980207 after you can say it is not good enough to win it okay but you have to accept levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and in the end two or three points is not a big gap
4980208 we were very close to doing it last season and were the most unlucky team with so many bad injuries
4980209 we finished with 83 points last season lost only three games and we have stability in our club which allows us to feel we will be better this year
4980210 i know we are not making the headlines with big names but what is important is what we produce on the pitch
4980211 nasri has shown that he is an intelligent player with a good technique who can integrate well with the rest of the team
4980212 he has shown also that he can add goals to his game which is what he started to do last season
4980213 we could have had a good hiding and after four minutes that was always going to be a possibility
4980214 but we worked very hard all over the pitch and as the game wore on we started posing a real threat and looked as if we could have scored a goal
4980215 if the goalkeeper hadnt pulled off some good saves and for a clearance off the line we might have been sitting here at 1 1
4980216 there are positives although we dont take much solace out of losing
4980217 but we came with a game plan trying to counter their slick passing play and although they created chances so did we
4980218 the attitude was good we have earned the right to be here because the championship is a hard hard league
4980219 now we have to work hard to stay here and we will be competitive in every match we play i dont want us to be known as little old albion
4980220 oh frick oh frick oh frick ill catch the 8
4980221 a little rough around the edges but when you look closely absolutely beautiful and the only one of her kind
4980222 my brother always celebrates like that when we beat liverpool
4980223 it means a lot to him and i think people should just let it go
4980224 this has been the most difficult decision i have ever had to make
4980225 this was a mutual decision between myself and the manager sir alex ferguson ive spent 18 years of my life at the club and i would like to thank sir alex all the players and the fans for their great support
4980226 this was not a decision we wanted to make but every time i picked the team and phils name was not on the teamsheet it was very difficult for me
4980227 you couldnt meet a better professional and he leaves with the gratitude of everyone at the the club for his service to united
4980228 i never thought i would get united out of my system
4980229 but this is a special club and it sucks you in now i look at myself as an everton player and the ex manchester united thing doesnt even come into my mind that is how much i have ingrained myself into the club breaking into the top four here would be as big as anything i won at my previous club
4980230 me parece una maravilla estoy encantado y feliz de recibir el premio

4980233 wed like to really reassure our visitors that york is a safe place
4980234 in fact our research and figures indicate that york is one of the safest cities to visit in the uk
4980235 it is something nobody wants to hear happening in their own city
4980236 the organizer hasnt paid us a dime yet so before we can settle with them were not bringing you guys back to shenzhen
4980237 factoring in the costs associated with planting and upkeep new york citys street trees provide an annual benefit of about 122 million according to the parks department the study concludes that new york receives 5 60 in benefits for every dollar spent on trees
4980238 instead of felling most trees the developers saved 80 percent of them then milled the rest for boards and put the sawdust on the community garden
4980239 saya menanggung harapan besar nilai dan aktivitas sekolah bagus maka ibu terguncang dan jatuh sakit ketika saya keluar
4980240 gelarnya sejajar akuntan tapi bi nggak kasih gelar takut kami keluar
4980241 waktu itu kepala dealing room jakarta pindah jadi saya disiapkan untuk menggantikannya saya sadar untuk jadi dealer harus punya pengalaman dan cakrawala dengan duduk di pusat keuangan dunia
4980242 maka di luar jam kerja saya main margin trading atas nama pribadi bukan bi
4980243 wah percaya dirilah saya pekerjaan bi yang diidamkan banyak orang nggak terlalu menggiurkan lagi
4980244 jiwa saya player jadi saya tak jadi masuk lse meskipun sudah diterima saya main valas terus dan ingin menikmati hasilnya saya ingin menikmati hidup bukan sebagai pegawai bi yang bertahun tahun cuma bisa naik mobil sederhana
4980245 saya masih ingat hanya dengan mengangkat telepon dari vila di puncak sambil main gaple dan makan pisang goreng bisa dapat as 60 000 semalam
4980246 tapi hidup saya tak habis di sana apa lagi saya harus membagi pengetahuan kepada banyak orang kalau menulis dan bikin analisis saya tak main saya meramal dan menghitung biar orang lain yang dapat keuntungan
4980247 cita cita saya membuat speed currency seperti bloomberg ia besar dan disegani meski awalnya juga dirintis di garasi

4980250 celtic are perfect for him and he will be an excellent signing for them
4980251 glenn was just 17 when i got to know him at feyenoord and i could tell from our first training session he was a no nonsense defender
4980252 when he was coming through the ranks we would often have practise games in training between the first team and younger players of course id be right up against glenn and he wouldnt hold back
4980253 i remember telling him early in his career at feyenoord he would be suited perfectly to british football
4980254 sometimes in holland we expect too much from our stoppers we want them to defend score goals and set up attacks there is perhaps less pressure to do that in britain
4980255 so ive no doubt glenn will do well and i hope its another success story for a dutchman at parkhead
4980256 he was playing regularly at the de kuip stadium for feyenoord in front of 50 000 passionate fans
4980257 so playing for celtic is something he will look forward to and be keen to take on
4980258 we have no guarantee that the russians will keep to their agreement

4980265 weve seen the press reports youre referring to but these are all matters for the pakistani political system and for the pakistanis to deal with
4980266 the optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds and the pessimist fears this is true
4980267 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
4980268 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions
4980269 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
4980270 he has now made two of the biggest divorce payments in showbiz history
4980271 at least no one can accuse him of leaving his ex wives short
4980272 filling your car eating out staying at a hotel or just doing the weekly shopping are all more costly undertakings than in other industrialised countries around the globe even without taking house prices into account
4980273 if the uk continues to be one of the most expensive addresses in the world while it fails to provide the best infrastructure and public services it should not be surprised if it loses its most qualified people and fails to attract foreign professionals
4980274 you shall lord your god with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind 38 this is the first and great commandment 40 on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets

4980276 mohannad the main character has indeed glued women to their tv sets but it is not only because he is cute
4980277 its mostly because he offers things many of us lack nowadays in our lives including romance compassion loyalty and a partner who is supportive to his independent wife he has become the role model against which many women have started to compare and judge their significant others
4980278 business executives today are telling us that when children graduate from school they need to be educated for the 21st century workforce
4980279 they tell us that they want our children to know how to get along to collaborate to communicate to know content like reading and math to be creative innovative thinkers and to have the confidence to learn from both their successes and their failures
4980280 the children who will be the workforce of the future are in our preschools today
4980281 the way this disease grows and spreads has perplexed clinicians and researchers for nearly three decades during which time the dismal outcome for metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma has remained essentially unchanged despite improvements in surgical technique radiation delivery and chemotherapy
4980282 a therapeutic strategy for children with muscle cancer might be developed that would target this growth receptor and possibly similar ones at the same time
4980283 the benefit to the patient is that such treatments are clinically available today for adult cancer patients who have other diseases importantly too the way these targeted therapies work is less toxic than chemotherapy

4980285 which fast is the most meritorious after the fasts of ramadan
4980286 messenger of allah i have seen you fasting in the month of shaban so frequently that i have never seen you fasting in any other month
4980287 that shaban is a month between rajab and ramadan which is neglected by many people and it is a month in which an account of the deeds of human beings is presented before the lord of the universe so i wish that my deeds be presented at a time when i am in a state of fasting
4980288 prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam used to fast the whole of shaban i said to him messenger of allah is shaban your most favorite month for fasting he said in this month allah prescribes the list of the persons dying this year therefore i like that my death comes when i am in a state of fasting
4980289 prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam would sometimes begin to fast continuously until we thought he would not stop fasting and sometimes he used to stop fasting until we thought he would never fast i never saw the messenger of allah sall allahu alayhi wa sallam fasting a complete month except the month of ramadan and i have never seen him fasting in a month more frequently than he did in shaban
4980290 i never saw the messenger of allah sall allahu alayhi wa sallam fasting in a month so profusely as he did in the month of shaban he used to fast in that month leaving only a few days rather he used to fast almost the whole of the month
4980291 i have never seen the messenger of allah fasting for two months continuously except in the months of shaban and ramadan
4980292 do not fast after the first half of the month of shaban is gone
4980293 do not precede the month of ramadan with one or two fasts
4980294 once prophet muhammad sall allahu alayhi wa sallam performed the salah of the night tahajjud and made a very long sajdah until i feared that he had passed away
4980295 allah almighty descends in a manner he best knows it in the night occurring in the middle of shaban and forgives a large number of people more than the number of the fibers on the sheep of the tribe kalb
4980296 this is the middle night of shaban allah frees in it a large number of the people from fire more than the number of the hair growing on the sheep of the tribe kalb but he does not even look at a person who associates partners with allah or at a person who nourishes malice in his heart against someone or at a person who cuts off the ties of kinship or at a man who leaves his clothes extending beyond his ankles as a sign of pride or at a person who disobeys his parents or at a person who has a habit of drinking wine
4980297 allah almighty looks upon all those created by him in the middle night of shaban and forgives all those created by him except the one who associates partners with him or the one who has malice in his heart against a muslim
4980298 the figure of 41 officially reported british rape victims so far is the worst ever in greek police records
4980299 at the present rate it is bound to break all previous records and will again give greece the unenviable record of having the largest number of british rape victims both in real figures but especially proportionately to the british tourism population
4980300 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4980301 why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4980302 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
4980303 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
4980304 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
4980305 training and athletic workouts probably do their work at least partly by modifying the expression of genes
4980306 the optimal position for wearing a backpack is high on the upper back with straps over both shoulders
4980307 kids who wear their backpacks in the more stylish lower back position or only use one strap may suffer shoulder pain and posture problems
4980308 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
4980309 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night

4980311 pharmacotherapy with salmeterol plus fluticasone propionate or the components reduces the rate of decline on fev1 in patients with moderate to severe copd thus slowing disease progression
4980312 to date smoking cessation is the only intervention that has conclusively been shown to alter the rate of decline in fev1
4980313 the most intriguing finding was that subjects seemed to accept mushrooms as a palatable and suitable culinary substitute for meat
4980314 lessons learned from the past research in extreme environments training conditioning and countermeasures for psychological stress are some of the things nasa is in the process of addressing for the upcoming age of exploration
4980315 if any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest i do think it is memory there seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers the failures the inequalities of memory than in any other of our intelligences
4980316 research shows that two thirds of patients high blood pressure is not controlled despite the best efforts of their doctors that is terrible
4980317 we are trying to identify the mechanisms through which blood pressure is regulated under normal everyday conditions which is what stress is and take that information back to the clinic to better determine what sort of therapy is going to be most effective at treating your blood pressure or your grandfathers
4980318 after one can it seemed to turn the young individual into one with more of the type of profile you would expect to see with someone with cardiovascular disease
4980319 the idea is to tell moms who are breastfeeding to take it a step forward to help other moms who cannot immediately breastfeed
4980320 it is possible that some unknown environmental factor is the cause of current health problems and of gulf war syndrome
4980321 but it is also possible that these symptoms result from the stress of military deployment especially prolonged and multiple deployments
4980322 women now comprise approximately 15 percent of our nations armed forces and since the persian gulf war combat roles for women have expanded substantially
4980323 this study is an attempt to understand the impact of deployment and war related stressors on the health of military women
4980324 i think the pull and the need for organs is so strong that it could easily encourage critical care physicians to consider the declaration of death potentially sooner than they normally would
4980325 while our results were not unexpected they do point to intriguing potential mechanisms to explain the gender differences in asthma incidence and severity
4980326 especially intriguing is that the differences in gender begin at the time of transition into early puberty

4980333 i would have walked because it was something that was actually ok walking i havent made the injury worse

4980360 no matter how deep the stain of your sins i can remove it i can make you as clean as freshly fallen snow even if you are stained as red as crimson i can make you as white as wool
4980361 oh what joy for those whose disobedience is forgiven whose sins are put out of sight yes what joy for those whose sin is no longer counted against them by the lord
4980362 oh well shes gay so its personal its not a feminism thing
4980363 aspect but clearly those arent playing a major part in the
4980364 muahaha lets oppress this group of people who think and act and appear to be women completely abstract from our oppression of real women which takes place two doors down
4980365 well weve worked out our masculinity issues on some not real women lets go find some with ovaries to love and respect and treat as equals
4980366 first they came to marginalize the trans women and i did nothing because theyre not real women

4980370 if were going to get goals out of the midfield were going to be successful the more goals we get from other portions of the field is going to play to our advantage whoever is scoring goals it doesnt matter as long as were scoring goals
4980371 i was just trying to get my head on it that was a great ball
4980372 id like to have that one back again a couple of inches to the left but what are you going to do we got the win
4980373 i wasnt getting behind and getting onto some of the services but it was good to be out there getting some minutes and getting a feel for things its especially good to be part of a victory
4980374 minutes and a couple of weeks of training and ill be 100 percent it was good to be out there and get a feel for how guys work and what they look for i told sigi the best thing was to take me out and then the offense got going getting two late goals was big
4980375 its awesome to have a guy with his experience you look at his profile on mlsnet and you see his goals and assists games played minutes everything hes the standard youd like to have those type of numbers all the younger guys are going to look up to him its awesome it will be really good for us
4980376 the first half our line was a little bit deeper than we liked so from the back everybody stepped up it was a good team effort
4980377 we wanted to keep it to zeroes we lost the first half i guess you could say we won the second half as long as we win one of the two halves by a goal extra were going to play to win
4980378 i have a headache now but its nice to be out there playing with the guys im glad we got three points i kind of felt like i used to coming out here and playing tonight now im ready to come out and contribute its important to keep winning at home
4980379 in the first 10 minutes it was very hard because i needed to get on the pace again
4980380 its not easy to come back but in the second half i felt better sharper and more confident with the ball im so happy i could contribute to getting three points again

4980399 there is no evidence that the use of b t poses any risk to humans domestic animals or the environment subsequent to intensive monitoring during repeated applications of b t it has been shown that the b t variety used in these insecticide formulations is specific to caterpillars like gypsy moths and does not pose a threat to humans
4980400 irritation of the eyes skin and respiratory tract might be associated with exposures to b t k and commercial formulations of b t k
4980401 infection with an influenza virus substantially increased mortality in mice exposed to various doses of b t k this effect raises concern about the susceptibility of individuals who have influenza or other viral respiratory infections to severe adverse responses to b t k exposure

4980488 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4980489 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala

4980505 it always make me laugh id sort of say im going to my boyfriends tonight nobody knew who he was
4980506 it was very exciting but i genuinely fell in love with him
4980507 i think i had hopes that we could walk on in our relationship but really and truthfully i think i was very aware that i wouldnt be able to do what i do for a living if id have stayed with him
4980508 if you think about it i would be in the theatre doing eight shows a week theyd have to check out the theatre every night check everyones bags it would be just impossible and there was nothing at that stage that was more important than what i did

4980546 whilst expected growth in employment globally has fallen from 45 per cent in 2007 to 33 per cent this year it has remained level in india 74 per cent
4980547 jayasuriya in form is always a great thing because he can contribute with both bat and ball
4980548 the start he gives makes a huge difference if he stays for 10 or 15 overs you are guaranteed a good start he is a bit like sehwag for india that gives a different dimension to our set up
4980549 whenever he sehwag gives us a good start we have a fair chance of winning the match
4980550 a good start is very important in any form of cricket but it does not mean the entire pressure is on the openers sehwag is a sort of player who takes a fair amount of risk he is a stroke player
4980551 he is in a very good nick and so is gautam gambhir they did well in the tests also and will have added responsibility but no pressure
4980552 jayasuriya can be compared with sehwag or retired australian adam gilchrist it is important not to let them have a good start
4980553 they are the batsmen who take chances they can commit mistakes if you try to restrict them all these players are very different but for someone like jayasuriya its important to get him out early
4980554 its almost like youre writing a book one post at a time
4980555 afgelopen week zijn jullie uit het emotionele kinder achtbaantje gestapt dit was de week van het grote mensenwerk

4980562 lo que ocurri en santa cruz es el inicio de lo que parece ser un plan una escalada de actos violentos que ya lo han anunciado algunos de los que se hacen llamar dirigentes c vicos para el martes 29 de la pr xima semana convocando a un paro y dijeron que lo har n respetar por la fuerza de la violencia
4980563 los discapacitados fueron utilizados como punta de lanza de una movilizaci n y por detr s de ellos ven an los c vicos diputados de podemos y unionistas
4980564 estaban azuzando la violencia para agredir a una de las instituciones m s importantes del pa s como es la polic a nacional
4980565 por lo que cualquier intento de neutralizar agredir o reemplazar a una instituci n como la polic a nacional ser un intento destinado al fracaso
4980566 en ning n momento el estado venezolano va a imponerle a la poblaci n un patr n de consumo que no se corresponda con la preferencia de la gente
4980567 este es un gobierno que ha estado decidido a establecer mecanismos de di logo con el sector privado todo el pa s ha sido testigo de los esfuerzos de di logo y de las reuniones de consultas que hemos hecho con todos los actores del sector privado el pa s espera una respuesta positiva de estos sectores
4980568 l gico que sectores que hist ricamente acostumbrados a chantajear al pueblo venezolano con los alimentos se sientan afectados con una ley que busca poner orden en un sector que es esencial para la vida humana como es la alimentaci n
4980569 its kind of remarkable to see how team play struggled and their season turned around just like that
4980570 its a smart move why risk internal problems later on and instead get it over with now find a replacement and spark the chemistry again
4980571 its funny cuz everytime devan made a play he would look at stunners gm pagdilao
4980572 we need to get to the playofs we need an easy win
4980573 hook us up against street fam thats a win right there
4980574 thats a match up ive been waiting for all season
4980575 is that what it takes to be gm of the year make roster space for talented ball players who you dont know for friends you grew up with
4980576 bank has several players that know their role and coming down the stretch this team could be dangerous
4980577 theres certain irrationality to any work in quantum gravitation shown in the strange gadgets of prof weber in the absurd creations of prof wheeler and other things but since i am among equally irrational men i wont be criticized i hope
4980578 i am investigating this subject despite the real difficulty that there are no experiments therefore there is no real challenge to compute true physical situations
4980579 sin embargo en el caso gravitatorio no es capaz de realizarlo
4980580 i did the integrals myself later but the algebra of the thing was done on a machine i couldnt have done it by hand
4980581 i think its historically interesting that its the first problem in algebra that i know of that was done on a machine that has not beend one by hand
4980582 its surprising i cant understand it unfortunately although i could retire from the field and leave you experts who are used to working in gravitation to worry about this matter i cant retire on the claim that the thing is now really irrational if it was not irrational before
4980583 it the withdrawal has not started yet the question of withdrawal is being considered now and the decision will be taken as the situation in the region is stabilised
4980584 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4980585 the disputed territories of south ossetia and abkhazia are georgian
4980586 were incredibly fortunate to have pete geren secretary of the u s army and general george casey chief of staff of the u s army join us via phone for the bloggers roundtable panel
4980587 i value the diary tremendously but im scared stiff its going to get lost
4980588 the army does not routinely monitor blogs regarding postings of specific personnel or groups of personnel it is not standard practice for the military to target or single out individual military blogs unless a particular blog has been brought to the attention of the chain of command or other dod department of defense officials for gross opsec operational security violations
4980589 the success of that is what will be the turning point for the soldiers to come home the faster we reconstruct the faster the soldiers can come back
4980590 there are instantaneous communications taking place around the world and we need to figure out how to take advantage of that opportunity instead of looking at it as a nemesis
4980591 you can call it strategic communication you can call it information engagement i like to call it operating in the information domain of the 21st century
4980592 so i decided after reading some other milblogs to start my own to vent my frustrations and try to keep my sanity intact as much as possible
4980593 growing up in b c toby nunn never imagined hed join the army go to war or become a celebrity let alone one of the most famous non commissioned soldiers to serve with american forces in iraq
4980594 i was just a scrawny kid from the bush up in canada
4980595 a very different view of the war than youll see on the nightly news
4980596 the only difference between suicide and martyrdom is press coverage

4980598 sometimes something will just trigger a memory and ill just start to choke up

4980631 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4980632 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4980679 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
4980680 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4980681 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4980682 we have no guarantee that the russians will keep to their agreement
4980683 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4980684 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4980685 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4980686 i played well on the first nine holes but i missed a few fairways on the last nine
4980687 i think ive put myself a little bit too far back but if i win tomorrow ill change my mind about taking next week off
4980688 i want to give myself every chance of course you can feel pressure playing at home but i think its more inspirational
4980689 six guys could win it its just lovely to be in contention going into the final round
4980690 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number sunday for somebody to win the tournament
4980691 i told my caddie if i made this i would get in the bunker and do a snow angel
4980692 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4980693 if i play good everything will take care of itself thats what im going to focus on just playing my round you know its my last tournament so i want to end on a good note hopefully ill be a really good one
4980694 they always have such a great golf course and always the condition of the golf course i realize this week is not easy because the rough is so long probably the longest rough of the year i think
4980695 i didnt really start making birdies until the back nine but i really enjoyed it
4980696 its important to be in good position for the weekend
4980697 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4980698 the courses on the pga tour have been set up hard so its a nice change to be really aggressive and sedgefield kind of suits my style
4980699 i try to play really aggressive all the time and so far its paid off great
4980700 as soon as i did that my mind kind of set in and played nice all day
4980701 every time i made a birdie it seemed like he made one too
4980702 this course you can make a lot of birdies but its quite easy to have a few bogeys in there too
4980703 i kind of knew at the beginning of the week i thought it was going to be a low scoring week just because you have a lot of wedges 8 irons 9 irons into par 4s
4980704 if i win this i will probably rethink and play in the netherlands next week and try to qualify
4980705 its farfetched to think that ill get a wild card
4980706 the ryder cup would be lovely and i would be an idiot if i said it does not matter but more important is enjoying my golf again
4980707 its never fun to miss the cut especially not at home
4980708 its fortunate that we dont play here all year around
4980709 i finished second four times and i really learned a lot each time i dont feel surprised because i keep learning and working hard and being relaxed
4980710 i have to play my own game and not think too much i have a four shot lead so theres a lot of room to play good
4980711 of course you dont expect anything like that that probably made my day
4980712 im making a lot more putts than i did the first day
4980713 all i can do is play the best i can and try to shoot a low score ill focus on being consistent hitting fairways and greens
4980714 i actually hit a lot of good shots i just never converted obviously im very disappointed
4980715 it was such a long day and i had a headache so i just tried to concentrate on every shot
4980716 i didnt hit the ball good and i didnt putt good i made birdie on the last hole and have a little chance now theres nothing i can do just come here tomorrow and do my best
4980717 im out of contention to win now but i still feel i can shoot in the 60s out here and that would be a great way to finish to get back into red numbers
4980718 i stopped that 64 degree wedge on the last hole a dime pretty much thank goodness i had that club in my bag
4980719 then after jordan and i both missed putts on the first playoff hole i made a putt on the second to win
4980720 i struggled coming down the back nine but pulled it out in the end when it mattered
4980721 i thought after the first few holes it was going to be a great round but then a few missed putts and it was tough it was a battle out there today im so happy to win but wish i could have played a little better
4980722 all i wanted to do coming here was make the junior ryder cup and i did that
4980723 i played a consistent round with no bogeys and that is definitely what i wanted to do i would have liked for a couple of more putts to drop and i left a couple short too
4980724 this is the biggest tournament that i have ever won
4980725 it is especially good because i was in the lead all four days i am usually coming from behind when i win so it is nice to win when i have been in front of everyone else
4980726 i was telling myself to be patient all day and the putts finally started dropping and i extended the lead
4980727 i came here to get into the junior ryder cup winning the junior pga championship was a huge bonus
4980728 anytime you get to represent your country and play in the junior ryder cup it is an honor
4980729 i am excited to play on the american team this year
4980730 ill be a little nervous or have some anxiety tomorrow
4980731 but i think if you dont have that there is something wrong with you
4980732 with the greens the way they are i figured i had to shoot 67 or better to have any chance of being near the leaders
4980733 to go through 72 holes without bogeying would have been pretty wishful thinking
4980734 i dropped it into a good lie where i did
4980735 i didnt have too many options honestly i was thinking to try to get it about 10 feet past the hole and make that putt for par
4980736 i put a new putter in play a few weeks ago and since then i have made just about everything i have looked at
4980737 no person except a natural born citizen or a citizen of the united states at the time of the adoption of this constitution shall be eligible to the office of president neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years and been fourteen years a resident within the united states

4980742 i would like the immediate opening of humanitarian corridors between south ossetia and the rest of georgia so that the dead can receive a dignified burial the wounded can get access to care and those who want to rejoin their dear ones can do so
4980743 security and fundamental rights which can never ever be violated have to be guaranteed to the ethnic minorities caught up in the conflict
4980744 i hope in the end that the current ceasefire struck through the efforts of the european union will lead to a lasting peace
4980745 i would like the immediate opening of humanitarian corridors between south ossetia and the rest of georgia so that the dead can receive a dignified burial the wounded can get access to care and those who want to rejoin their dear ones can do so
4980746 paused and just stood there in limbo doing nothing for several long minutes
4980747 hardly knew any words to her songs and seemed to have no idea what she was supposed to do
4980748 i think after 9 11 my friends we should have told americans to join the peace corps expand the military serve a cause greater than your self interest
4980749 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4980750 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
4980751 i have to tell you up front both of these guys are my friends they both care deeply about america they are both patriots
4980752 they have very different ideas on how america can be strengthened
4980753 i was so obsessed with me and the reasons i might be dissatisfied i couldnt focus on other people
4980754 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4980755 means im saved and forgiven our faith encompasses not just america but the world
4980756 for a minute there we were just two christians worshipping together
4980757 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation
4980758 this nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
4980759 they achieved a revolution now the russians are coming in there in an act of aggression we have to not only bring about cease fire we have to have honor
4980760 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
4980761 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
4980762 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
4980763 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
4980764 solving big problems are not going to be easy we are all going to think about how we using things energy wise if we pretend like everything is free we are betraying the tradition of america
4980765 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4980766 we want freedom indians go home and kashmir is ours

4980788 by no means do i want to go through another year with what im going through now
4980789 but at the same time i dont think i want my career to end this way either i think that lends me to think i want to pitch next year i think its easier to walk away if you can honestly tell yourself you know what i cant do it anymore and i dont know that i can answer that question right now because my body hasnt allowed me to do it this year as much i wanted to
4980790 when i was healthy i pitched well when i wasnt i didnt that makes it harder to say i cant do it anymore

4980800 my mother was also against it for the obvious reasons
4980801 it was just one of those childhood dreams i never grew out of everybody was against it because nobody thinks of jewish people as police officers

4980832 he may go home or have an operation hes still in a lot of pain and its hard for him to swallow or to breathe deeply hes being fed intravenously
4980833 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead
4980834 the reason we are hosting this historic event is to stake out common ground for the common good

4980836 lo primero que me gustar a hacer es simplemente abrazar a mi madre literalmente la he visto unos 30 segundos en todo este tiempo
4980837 una de las cosas que quiero hacer de verdad es tirarme en la cama durante cinco minutos y simplemente relajarme
4980838 ella sencillamente dijo felicidades y entonces empez a llorar y yo empec a llorar y entonces mi hermana empez a llorar de verdad que no hemos pasado demasiado tiempo juntos

4980853 first time i ever saw the guy you know the expression a broken man
4980854 it doesnt surprise me the results would be so skewed con sidering it was conducted by a group led by the vice chairman of the democratic party
4980855 barack obama is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate you have helped build this movement from the bottom up and barack wants you to be the first to know his choice

4980858 shes so weak why doesnt she just keep to a diet if shes so unhappy
4980859 padraig has done ireland so proud again its great what hes done in the past month
4980860 i saw almost all the open and couldnt believe that shot he played on the 17th it was just inspirational and then he got over a bad round at oakland hills to win the us pga
4980861 for my part i can still win tournaments it was proved last season with marco fu and dominic dale winning from out of the top 16 i even have another world title in me
4980862 we are speaking to southampton and we have agreed a deal with them
4980863 hes got good experience but is also a young lad with good legs
4980864 you need that in the premier league but we will see because the deal is not finalised yet
4980865 if it was a true reflection of the game there should have been goals
4980866 im happy with the performance but obviously disappointed not to have won the game
4980867 the system worked well we played some good stuff and unfortunately we just couldnt take our chances
4980868 hes worked very very hard in the close season and i think there were many positive performances and a lot to build on
4980869 hes a quick player and one weve been watching for a couple of years
4980870 the margin of victory surprised us all right but we were capable of winning the game
4980871 the third goal put us in the comfort zone and games hinge on things like that
4980872 there will be no problem about a new contract for gary
4980873 he will be up for a new deal you can be sure about that because hes a remarkable person
4980874 the way he has come back after 18 months is remarkable and to then play to the level he played against portsmouth last sunday was perfect
4980875 st mirren had a couple of chances especially the one that hit the bar but we cancelled that out by hitting the bar also
4980876 i felt we were dangerous around their box and if striker conor sammon had a wee break he could have had a couple of goals
4980877 hes getting closer to his goal and i thought he was a handful today
4980878 hes only young and he has a willingness to run into corners and although he has a lot to learn he can only get better
4980879 we felt a little bit aggrieved as it was no worse than earlier challenges that went unpunished
4980880 i thought he was man of the match today he brings other players into the game
4980881 its a long season and if you look at the quality we now have competition for places
4980882 throughout my life i have gotten 7 piercings and 1 tattoo from zebra in berkeley and i have nothing but good things to say about this
4980883 oh yeah they just do that should have gotten a bigger one
4980884 i was coming around the track and came into a tight turn and i hit a cone and the cone got caught underneath the tire so the tire locked up and slammed into the wall
4980885 the margin of victory surprised us all right but we were capable of winning the game
4980886 the third goal put us in the comfort zone and games hinge on things like that
4980887 there will be no problem about a new contract for gary

4980900 i thought he was man of the match today he brings other players into the game
4980901 its a long season and if you look at the quality we now have competition for places
4980902 claire claire you know who claire is she came to visit here a couple of months ago
4980903 yes please i have no idea what these peoples real names are
4980904 though we have not increased the interest rates yet but there is a need to increase it by 50 basis points in about a months time we will do so
4980905 i do not think demand will come down if demand of auto loans for new vehicles go down then it will increase for the second hand cars
4980906 we will ask for subvention from companies if they do not give it we will have to increase the interest rates we do not want sales to get affected
4980907 currently commercial vehicle and construction equipment segment constitute about 3 4 per cent of our business we are working on expanding this
4980908 though we have not increased the interest rates yet but there is a need to increase it by 50 basis points in about a months time we will do so
4980909 i do not think demand will come down if demand of auto loans for new vehicles go down then it will increase for the second hand cars
4980910 we will ask for subvention from companies if they do not give it we will have to increase the interest rates we do not want sales to get affected
4980911 currently commercial vehicle and construction equipment segment constitute about 3 4 per cent of our business we are working on expanding this
4980912 i will try to get an eighty five or higher in all of my classes
4980913 were hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
4980914 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4980915 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4980916 like anybody else weve had a few borrowers lose their jobs and some bankruptcies
4980917 were only about 2 million in assets so if we lose a car loan to default its kind of a big hit
4980918 theres definitely a change in credit unions nonperforming assets and profitability either showing poor profitability or swinging over to a loss
4980919 we did see a slight decline in the star ratings
4980920 weve been hit hard in washington county for the last 15 years
4980921 its just a bleak economy and peoples wages dont rise with inflation
4980922 weve seen delinquencies and problem loans more in california florida nevada and arizona not in western pennsylvania it has been a relatively stable market
4980923 our examiner in may said we were out of the woods
4980924 but he doesnt want us to rest on our laurels
4980925 i guess its a function of the economy where we started getting some really slow payers
4980926 no team in baseball has been decimated by injuries like this
4980927 chien ming wang won 19 games two straight years joba chamberlain became the most dominating pitcher in baseball you cant lose two guys like that
4980928 the only way i want to see general so and so released is feet first in a box
4980929 remember how i talked this afternoon about releasing general so and so its time to release him now
4980930 if i dont betray my buddies and my country then this will be a fifteen minute movie
4980931 something we cant see is hunting us down and killing us one by one i know lets split up
4980932 this house is not prepared to die for king and country
4980933 this house is not prepared to die for gt king and country
4980934 this house is not prepared to die for king and gt gt country
4980935 serve their country and defend the interests of their fellow citizens
4980936 this house is not prepared to die for king and gt country
4980937 god will save her fear you not be you the men youve been
4980938 n s passamos esta semana toda tentando melhorar o moral dele mas ele estava em uma grande melancolia numa tristeza muito grande desistiu de comer desistiu de tudo mais ou menos como dizia minha cunhada um caso de romeu e julieta
4980939 a aus ncia de minha m e desde 29 de abril com ele sendo obrigado a completar os seus 94 anos de idade sem ela foi terr vel at quarta feira passada ele estava ouvindo m sica com a gente mas depois a vela apagou
4980940 tenho tanto para lembrar do meu pai desde a m sica e poesia at os grandes conselhos como ele costumava dizer tem que ter estilo tenho uma sorte muito grande porque eu tive pai burra velha e estou aqui
4980941 a gente mais ou menos estava esperando e aconteceu do jeito que a fam lia toda desejava que ele morresse em casa e com tranq ilidade infelizmente perdemos um grande cantor e um grande compositor mas fica a uma obra um legado muito grande
4980942 ele viveu estes anos 50 intensamente o rio de janeiro era um baiano carioca que amava esta cidade embora tenha esta carga toda da bahia ele sentia orgulha de al m de ser o grande baiano que era ter sido tamb m um grande carioca
4980943 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4980944 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
4980945 threatens the state of florida with a major disaster he wrote in an executive order that action puts the national guard on high alert and gives state officials authority to order evacuations and distribute recovery supplies wtnt31 knhc 171150
4980946 he didnt look good to me and i knew this could be it
4980947 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
4980948 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
4980949 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he
4980950 he said you never seen a black man as pretty as me
4980951 i said what do you have for me and he kissed me that was our first kiss
4980952 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold
4980953 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film released july 11 2007 which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
4980954 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
4980955 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the will not be affected by this change
4980956 i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of director david yates and our incomparable cast
4980957 i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer
4980958 even as we put finishing touches on this latest film
4980959 we are already beginning preparations on the final two films and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
4980960 rick ross orchestrated a brutal attack upon dj vlad carried out at his direction by his accomplices in retribution for media coverage of
4980961 painstakingly created his public persona to be that of a major drug dealer and gangster but is in reality a former correctional officer
4980962 ive been hearing things about me on your web site we gonna make a story we going to see each other we going to talk where are you
4980963 following a brief conversation between dj vlad and ross in which ross said we got beef ross accomplices who had surrounded dj vlad while he spoke with ross proceeded to strike and beat dj vlad in ross presence and without any protest on ross part
4980964 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
4980965 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
4980966 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
4980967 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
4980968 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
4980969 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
4980970 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
4980971 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming
4980972 idealnya kami memiliki empat striker tangguh dalam skuad sama seperti empat bomber yang pernah saya miliki ketika sukses merebut treble winner pada1999 saat itu saya punya andy cole dwight yorke teddy sheringham serta ole gunnar solskjaer
4980973 dengan barisan empat striker saya yakin tim ini bakal mampu bersaing di berbagai ajang yang diikuti hingga musim berakhir
4980974 in the same manner as if the increased asset average or asset value of the remaining securities had resulted from appreciation in the value of the portfolio securities or from an increase in income or from other results of expert investment management
4980975 if it looks like something your child produced you shouldnt take it
4980976 i dont see why anyone doesnt want to participate unless theyre wanting to hire illegal aliens or dont care
4980977 the system is not set up to correct all possible identity theft or fraud
4980978 for e verify to be an outstanding tool it needs that type of enhancement
4980979 right now the onus is on the employer to figure out what the fraud is
4980980 i believe it is a good tool i believe in having tools that assist employers to achieve the responsibility they have that the person theyre hiring is who he says he is
4980981 i recognize its limitations but its the best we have
4980982 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4980983 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4980984 i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part
4980985 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4980986 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4980987 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4980988 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4980989 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
4980990 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4980991 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest
4980992 i dont think its right we now impose the will of this bill on other councils
4980993 all of the appointment statutes are in and of themselves nonuniform as well
4980994 therefore the new appointment process may be made inapplicable to cities through the use of charter ordinance
4980995 this proposed ordinance is not being pushed by council members but by the legal department following their review of the new law
4980996 couple that with our unique form of government in which the mayor is a member of the governing body as well as the mayors ability to veto legislation and you can see why the legal department would suggest chartering out of such a law
4980997 there is no doubt that american workers are feeling the pressure from escalating energy and food prices as well as a slumping real estate market but the majority are making retirement a priority and staying the course
4980998 there have been a number of reports which have been based on anecdotal and regional information
4980999 the overall information were getting is that there has not been that much change
4981000 the project will play an integral role in attracting students from various regions and assist our institution in expanding its recruitment strategy and strategic plan initiatives
4981001 weve kept a lot of the really nice older features and weve modernized everything else
4981002 we had a wonderful footprint to work with and it would have been really different without that
4981003 its a very complex process and there are a lot of pieces that fit together but that was definitely important in making it a reality
4981004 i dont know how they could have done this type of a large scale project without it
4981005 it will have a positive impact on the neighborhood we had been losing businesses there
4981006 if you have 400 or 500 students i cant imagine little shops not opening up to cater to that kind of life
4981007 students now when they are looking at a college will turn it down because of the housing
4981008 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4981009 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4981010 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4981011 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4981012 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4981013 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4981014 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4981015 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4981016 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4981017 like anybody else weve had a few borrowers lose their jobs and some bankruptcies
4981018 were only about 2 million in assets so if we lose a car loan to default its kind of a big hit
4981019 theres definitely a change in credit unions nonperforming assets and profitability either showing poor profitability or swinging over to a loss

4981025 but he doesnt want us to rest on our laurels
4981026 i guess its a function of the economy where we started getting some really slow payers
4981027 in fact its so much fun having jay teach me all of noel s songs on the guitar hooray that im thinking of doing an jay z remix album a la the grey album potential titles are champagne superhova or definitely jay z ill keep you posted
4981028 p p s noel i did write a song called back to black which actually has 7 chords in it
4981029 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4981030 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4981031 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4981032 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4981033 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4981034 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4981035 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4981036 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4981037 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4981038 what joy that gives me to hear i see that they could have a future
4981039 it wounds my soul to think that i might not be able to give them what they desire to think that i might fail them
4981040 i wish people could put themselves in our situation for one moment what would they do if they were poor if they were in dire need wouldnt they risk coming here as well
4981041 i wish that the hearts of people with hearts of stone of ice the people of ice could be transformed into good hearts we came here to work not to do harm to anyone
4981042 they are serious offenses and we will not apologize for enforcing the nations laws if 305 u s citizens had committed identity theft and misuse of social security numbers would people expect us to look the other way
4981043 any disruption whether to families or communities should be put at the feet of those who violate the law
4981044 what happened here is a microcosm of whats happening in the country
4981045 if nothing is done there will be many many more postvilles around the country and thats not healthy for anyone
4981046 i hope our little town will survive i think it will
4981047 weve gotten through lots of things and well get through this too itll take awhile and its tough but were just a resilient bunch in iowa
4981048 i heard there was work here so i came first to get settled if it works out then i will bring them
4981049 i guess theres a big list of potential roots to the problem there are definitely frustrations in the youth which have been in our culture for quite a while
4981050 but no matter how many times you read about it it strikes you with total shock the lack of humanity or like i say in album track
4981051 you know theres actually saying grow a heart man how could you actually harm another person whats happening to us man
4981052 its been in the news a lot in london but in glasgow its always been like that if you grow up in glasgow youve been chased with something ive been chased with a five iron
4981053 well i wasnt going to say anything about it but your dog cant swim can he
4981054 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
4981055 the area has an ice base and the snow sometimes isnt stable
4981056 id say hes been there it the snow and ice has rolled and hes gone
4981057 it was a particularly good day up here this is just bad luck i presume
4981058 how can air climb the columns of cans when theres no hole at the bottom of the can
4981059 he doesnt listen carefully to people and make reasoned judgments
4981060 if john says im going with so and so you cant count on that the next morning
4981061 to see them go away and have to buckle down for another night it was pretty hard but you just got to try and hang in there and hope that you will get out
4981062 we were glad to get out of there because the weather was starting to deteriorate more and more
4981063 its a bit strange for us because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
4981064 as a matter of fact the second time my husband rang up they said they had the names they knew who they were but they couldnt tell us
4981065 we were speaking to them on friday night up until saturday morning
4981066 just the last couple of days sitting around in a tent watching helicopters go in the wrong direction looking for us not what i went there hoping for
4981067 you can get weather like that in summer you just get more of it in winter
4981068 it was a good time of year for us to go up there and its not crowded with other people
4981069 there were times when we could hear avalanches around us
4981070 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
4981071 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
4981072 there are ups and downs with a slight advantage to obama
4981073 if anybody had asked us a couple of months ago whether or not we would like to be where we are today which from what we can tell is a pretty even race we would have been pretty thrilled
4981074 i dont think its right we now impose the will of this bill on other councils
4981075 all of the appointment statutes are in and of themselves nonuniform as well
4981076 therefore the new appointment process may be made inapplicable to cities through the use of charter ordinance
4981077 this proposed ordinance is not being pushed by council members but by the legal department following their review of the new law
4981078 couple that with our unique form of government in which the mayor is a member of the governing body as well as the mayors ability to veto legislation and you can see why the legal department would suggest chartering out of such a law

4981091 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4981092 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
4981093 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives

4981102 britney and kevin wanted to settle but there were issues of how much time we wanted and there was an upcoming court hearing scheduled
4981103 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4981104 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that senator mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson

4981145 but were not doing it the chinese are in cooperation with the cuban government even the communists have figured out that a good answer to high prices is more supply
4981146 even china recognizes that oil and natural gas is readily available off our shores thanks to fidel castro theyve been given a permit to drill for oil setting aside the notion that major political figures are holding up the chinese government as worth emulating the idea that china is drilling off the coast of florida is simply not true

4981185 government has been the voice of big business not small business
4981186 voters dont like bad behavior on the part of c e o s but economic populism really doesnt work
4981187 and both guys have to show leadership on the economy
4981188 they have to be seen as thoughtful responsible stewards of economic policy who can get along with business and talk to business
4981189 john talks to and cares about big business but he has the greatest affinity for small business which creates more than 70 percent of the jobs in this country
4981190 his entire lens on economic policy is job creation and small business
4981191 ive gotten calls for a year and half saying tell me about this guy
4981192 says william m daley who served as secretary of commerce in the clinton administration before returning to chicago where he is a senior executive with jpmorgan chase
4981193 ive long admired john mccain and i told him i would be delighted to help him
4981194 and i said i have good news for you john
4981195 mccains style makes the big business crowd uncomfortable but they will back him in the election because of his conservative free market policies
4981196 the small business crowd likes him for reasons of both policy and persona
4981197 i have never run a small struggling business unless you count my presidential campaign last year
4981198 not to denigrate government but to make it better not to deride it but to restore its good name
4981199 when he tells you something i think he really means it
4981200 barack tended to attract the younger up and coming leaders at big firms and people in private equity
4981201 many of them had an interest in economic policy as well we didnt have as many gray hairs at the table so there was room for them
4981202 he was remarkably clear eyed and thoughtful about what the country needed to do
4981203 most businesspeople at the big business level are republicans either knee jerk or born into it
4981204 and no one has wrapped himself around the new technology and the new fund raising space like obama so to that crowd this is a message
4981205 he listened more than he talked which is always a good thing
4981206 he clearly sees himself as a clever synthesizer of other peoples ideas and i think that is an important skill in a president
4981207 i dont think senator obama has an agenda for big business
4981208 hes trying to affect the overall economy and hes got to find a way to help people who are worse off i dont think he loses any sleep worrying about how to craft a policy just for big business nor should he and i say that as a former commerce secretary
4981209 but on the big issues that will determine whether the u s is prosperous and whether we improve the living standards of working people i think hes right
4981210 to see them go away and have to buckle down for another night it was pretty hard but you just got to try and hang in there and hope that you will get out
4981211 we were glad to get out of there because the weather was starting to deteriorate more and more
4981212 its a bit strange for us because were kind of up on the mountain and i think its actually the people back down here at home that went through more trauma than we went through
4981213 as a matter of fact the second time my husband rang up they said they had the names they knew who they were but they couldnt tell us
4981214 we were speaking to them on friday night up until saturday morning
4981215 just the last couple of days sitting around in a tent watching helicopters go in the wrong direction looking for us not what i went there hoping for
4981216 you can get weather like that in summer you just get more of it in winter
4981217 it was a good time of year for us to go up there and its not crowded with other people
4981218 there were times when we could hear avalanches around us
4981219 we were aware that we were camped in a safe spot but of course the thought is still in the back of your mind youre not entirely safe and how long is it going to take for them to come and get us
4981220 the area has an ice base and the snow sometimes isnt stable
4981221 id say hes been there it the snow and ice has rolled and hes gone
4981222 it was a particularly good day up here this is just bad luck i presume
4981223 it looks like a bonnie and clyde car its different
4981224 there are a lot of neat cars here and the weather is wonderful
4981225 she is very proud of it and wanted to show it off
4981226 it is about the power i love every car here
4981227 the segment we filmed today is scheduled to air during national preparedness month in september specifically during the week that the today show will be focusing on first aid
4981228 we filmed about 35 minutes of footage from the class today
4981229 that will be sent off to be edited for the segment
4981230 we got a call from stephanie becker with the today show
4981231 she told us they were preparing a series for national preparedness month that will focus on ways citizens can become more prepared cpr is one area they are focusing on
4981232 i teach lots of classes like this for companies community groups and service organizations like the boy scouts
4981233 we teach full cpr which includes infant child and adult and first aid which covers cold and heat related injuries soft tissue muscle and joint injuries
4981234 she called to tell me that thered be a camera man and a producer at the cpr class i was signed up for on saturday
4981235 we had to make sure all the class participants today signed a release form saying it was ok for them to be filmed for the show
4981236 we also had to coordinate all the details with the red cross headquarters
4981237 if it hadnt been for you none of the others who also helped me would have mattered
4981238 during the race i apparently had a heart attack and fortunately i had a guardian angel maybe someday i can give back to someone else what she gave me
4981239 since i wasnt the only one who helped him i felt a little guilty getting all the attention but when they said it was to encourage others to take cpr and be prepared i decided it would be a good thing
4981240 it gave me the confidence to do what i had to do when i came upon keith after he collapsed when i first saw him during the race i was scared but i had to put that aside then the adrenaline kicked in i checked his pulse and when i realized he didnt have any i started chest compressions soon others came along and another woman started giving the rescue breaths and then someone else relieved me on the chest compressions
4981241 im glad to meet him again this time while hes conscious
4981242 this reunion today with the today show is a good message for all of us i learned cpr and got to help him and now hes taken cpr and maybe he can help someone else sometimes we have to get out of our comfort zones and not be embarrassed that others are watching especially when someones life is at stake
4981243 its what you learn after you know it all that counts
4981244 for god has not destined us for wrath but for obtaining salvation through our lord jesus christ who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we will live together with him therefore encourage one another and build up one another just as you also are doing
4981245 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also
4981246 i used to go to swap meets and sell my wares on weekends due to the price of fuel it was no longer profitable especially for the long distance ones
4981247 all of their costs are rising very quickly and they are getting hammered
4981248 four or five months ago thats when i noticed it and now i dont know how i didnt notice it before
4981249 my daughter is a senior this year and i havent saved any money for college and we were going to move and buy this bigger home i was kinda stressed out about it and i was thinking how am i going to do it all thats when i saw it so maybe i was meant to see it then
4981250 i figure ill put it on there and see what happens because i really can see it
4981251 some people laugh and some people are like wow some people are pretty shocked
4981252 the margin of victory surprised us all right but we were capable of winning the game
4981253 the third goal put us in the comfort zone and games hinge on things like that
4981254 if it was a true reflection of the game there should have been goals
4981255 im happy with the performance but obviously disappointed not to have won the game
4981256 the system worked well we played some good stuff and unfortunately we just couldnt take our chances
4981257 hes worked very very hard in the close season and i think there were many positive performances and a lot to build on
4981258 hes a quick player and one weve been watching for a couple of years
4981259 there will be no problem about a new contract for gary
4981260 he will be up for a new deal you can be sure about that because hes a remarkable person
4981261 the way he has come back after 18 months is remarkable and to then play to the level he played against portsmouth last sunday was perfect

4981269 st mirren had a couple of chances especially the one that hit the bar but we cancelled that out by hitting the bar also
4981270 i felt we were dangerous around their box and if striker conor sammon had a wee break he could have had a couple of goals
4981271 hes getting closer to his goal and i thought he was a handful today
4981272 hes only young and he has a willingness to run into corners and although he has a lot to learn he can only get better
4981273 we felt a little bit aggrieved as it was no worse than earlier challenges that went unpunished
4981274 i thought he was man of the match today he brings other players into the game
4981275 its a long season and if you look at the quality we now have competition for places

4981295 we would really like a freestanding library and we already have plans

4981306 sehwag is the sort who takes a bit of risk at times whenever he gets us that start we have a fair chance of winning hes in very good nick so is gambhir both played well in the tests so they have some added responsibility on them
4981307 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
4981308 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
4981309 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
4981310 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
4981311 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
4981312 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
4981313 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england

4981321 i have always thought that hospice is wonderful it touches everyones life at one time or another
4981322 i have set a new record each of the six years ive done this and hope to exceed last years
4981323 i had heard about it for a long time and wanted to play in it for a long time
4981324 its nice of paul to come to ohio we think ohio is a premiere state in horseshoe pitching
4981325 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
4981326 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
4981327 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
4981328 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
4981329 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
4981330 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
4981331 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
4981332 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future
4981333 we are using native plants and grasses identified in an 1819 land survey to return the site to the way it was then a haven for birds mammals amphibians reptiles and insects

4981338 today the iraqi oil ministry celebrates a return to work by iraqi oil exploration teams after 20 years of interruption
4981339 the ministry has begun to build new refineries in the country in the provinces of dhiqar kirkuk karbala and misan while renovating other refineries in baghdad basra and diwaniyah

4981341 as at today we have an oil reserve base of 33 6 billion barrels
4981342 a trans caspian gas pipeline can be considered a forever buried chimera
4981343 it became clear for all the participants of these energy games that nothing will go through the caspian sea
4981344 no civilization can survive the physical destruction of its resource base
4981345 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
4981346 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
4981347 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack

4981357 it is the madness of folly to expect mercy from those who have refused to do justice and even mercy where conquest is the object is only a trick of war the cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf
4981358 its an olive branch that we think will pay dividends in party unity
4981359 the one thing that obama should never have agreed to is a roll call vote with hillary clinton
4981360 so grateful that we are going to have a story which is hillary clintons attempt tacitly to take over the obama victory and that story will go through virtually every day of the convention

4981366 why isnt obama romping the obvious answer and both the excessively genteel obama campaign and a too compliant press bear responsibility for it is that the public doesnt know who on earth john mccain is

4981368 as i went on vacation at the end of july barack obama was leading john mccain by three to four percentage points in national polls when i returned last week he still was but lo and behold a whole new plot twist had rolled off the bloviation assembly line in those intervening two weeks obama had lost the election

4981375 there will be no problem about a new contract for gary
4981376 he will be up for a new deal you can be sure about that because hes a remarkable person
4981377 the way he has come back after 18 months is remarkable and to then play to the level he played against portsmouth last sunday was perfect

4981383 it has not started yet the question of withdrawal is being considered now and the decision will be taken as the situation in the region is stabilised
4981384 what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
4981385 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4981386 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens

4981394 ive been thinking about it ever since kyle hamilton told reporters sunday about the disappointing finish in 2004
4981395 i never thought id get the opportunity to be a favourite in an olympics again
4981396 just to come in as a favourite is an amazing experience to do it twice is just amazing and to win i cant say anymore
4981397 i knew that we had won it there was nobody coming back at that point coxswain brian price told reporters sunday in beijing as he talked about raising his arms near the finish line
4981398 we started everything we could in the first 500 to get ourselves into the race and essentially through the middle its a dogfight everybody wants a piece of it said ian brambell of the mens four crew
4981399 we knew that we had a really solid 500 and it was just a matter of not waiting for it but going everyone together we closed the eyes and went for it
4981400 coming into the last 500 we seemed to get our rhythm and ian said go for it we committed everything we had and went said parsons
4981401 we knew it was tight we really had no idea where we were when we started that sprint
4981402 it was exhausting there wasnt anything left in the end
4981403 when we looked over i could see that our bow ball was definitely in front of the germans it was just making sure the judges were with us
4981404 after our first two races we kind of had a tendency of sort of getting caught in the last 500 so we made it our mission to really execute that last 500 and lay it all down on the line and i think we did that

4981417 are you sister have i met your sister before is she playing with us today
4981418 eh girlfriend before me why does not one love me i want a girlfriend too
4981419 youd do aiba desu hes ohno but everyone either calls him riida or captain hes the handsome one im the cute one
4981420 the colours for that are all wrong why puce the design doesnt make sense
4981421 i hope you realise matsumoto san that youre only drawing unnecessary attention to yourself in that outfit students do not generally wear that to class in keio
4981422 thats you and thats aiba on the ground like a ball there sho with his hands in his hair there and chiaki there
4981423 thats really very good but why is this area blank
4981424 if you can tear him away from his gaming marathon he always says he wants to clear a level and before you know it he wants to finish the game
4981425 he wanted to go to todai more herbal tea maybe it was good remember
4981426 theres no herbal tea stall in todai my brother said so
4981427 when do we eat is the office lady bring it up now
4981428 you have no idea what were talking about do you riida
4981429 todai riida and why nino is going there when his drama there has finished we think matsujun thinks its a girl
4981430 ne why dont we follow him and see who or what hes doing today
4981431 iya ano ne he dressed very carefully which means hes going somewhere anywhere but home it must be to see his secret todai student girlfriend
4981432 what would a professor want with nino i still prefer an office lady a cute one with dimples when she smiles and a behind goes wosh wosh wosh from left to right when she walks
4981433 ohno kun as a point nino does not take kindly to intrusions into matters he regards as strictly private
4981434 theres only so much he can do to keep his girlfriend private arent you the least curious what sort of girl he has squirreled away
4981435 i dont know how to tell nino about something every time i try its like something is stopping me i know it sounds stupid but i really want to tell nino and only nino not the others i dont know how they will think nino doesnt know yet maybe he suspects because he can see through people
4981436 that partially elucidates why you have been studying him intently if you think i have any influence over him you are mistaken he knows his own mind as firmly as i know mine this may be impolite coming from a near complete stranger ohno san however it has to be said i do not approve of jealousy it often means that you are envious and envy is predicated on the belief that you think you are more deserving than the person in question whatever the freeloader is to me should not and will not spoil your friendship i can see that you are inordinately close i have no objections to that he needs good friends around him that you trust him implicitly is evident that he holds you in high regard is also evident you truly have the highest form of friendship and you have my sincere felicitations on that
4981437 iya its not rude i like people to be honest okaasan says the world would be less complicated if we were all honest with each other
4981438 i take it no one else at this table knows
4981439 nino should meet her i want him too hes my best friend i dont want to have to hide it from him the others i dont want them to know yet
4981440 every time i try to tell nino he cant make it or something comes up
4981441 then wait for him to suggest that you go out dispatch a convenient call or message to your lady to meet you at the appropriate place and time make an excuse that you have to meet someone along the way to pick something up et voila the desired meeting takes place and the freeloader will be forced to at least keep a civil tongue in his mouth
4981442 after nino meets her would you like to meet her too
4981443 maybe the four of us could go out together i hear that the tokyo opera city art gallery has a new exhibition kaoru would like that she studies art and is very very good at it we could all go and then have dinner together i think itd be fun
4981444 ah the asada hiroshi works are the special this season i would very much like to see that and perhaps kaoru san would be so kind as to explain how his works incorporates surrealistic themes in his familys traditional nihonga
4981445 you can make these up to one week in advance
4981446 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4981447 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4981448 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
4981449 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4981450 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4981451 to me a human life matters whether black or white beautiful or ugly tall or short rich or poor jew or christian or muslim or atheist sane or insane these are just labels that set us apart all have human dignity there would be no prejudice if we celebrated our similarities we all share and crave love and acceptance for who we are not as someone wants us to be it is difficult to reach out to another to love another without first loving ourselves everyone has a toothache and baggage and it keeps our love from emanating out to another person and up into the universe but when you come to realize that all we have on this earth is our time and our integrity and that we are here to serve each other we all have the capacity to become like mother teresa serving one person at a time one person hurting with a toothache at a time and it could be our spouse our child our neighbor our paper boy or that complete stranger standing over in the corner alone
4981452 of all i have received or given my daughter is the most precious of all having a family is the only gift i have ever given myself as i reflect back i often feel i will have passed through failing to have done anything worthy to deserve one line in the eons of history by many i may be remembered as a real estate agent but i want to be remembered as having given life to a child my life has been empty and meaningless until i reflect on my daughter and her mother my wife my daughter collins gave meaning to my brief tenure on this planet
4981453 how lucky i am to have found charlyn and to have chosen her out of all the choices i could have made there is no doubt i made the right choice
4981454 though i know exactly where my mother wants to be buried and that my father cringes at the thought of his body suffocating entombed in the ground we have not often spoken about death as a family i think that my father almost died in the hospital this past week and the abruptness with which i was reminded of his impending premature death struck with full force a lung transplant could extend his life another ten or fifteen years but the failure of such a major surgery seems to present the possibility of picking ones own date to die we sat huddled in the living room my mom and i on the floor my dad in his favorite chair with the dog on his lap crying grieving and finally talking about the decision that we that my father has to make
4981455 okay that all sounds fine now what can you do about my nose
4981456 dear donor family not too many people on this earth get a second chance at life i did because of a compassionate caring person in your family i was told before the surgery a new lung would improve the quality of my life but perhaps not the quantity i am so thankful to be alive for however long god grants me life i promise you i will honor your gift with my last breath thanksgiving now has a whole different meaning to me i was called to university of colorado hospital on november 23rd at 9 30 pm the surgery from 3 00 am to 8 00 am on thanksgiving put me on the road to a new life only a week before my wife was concerned i would never see 2006 after struggling for breath for ten long years especially the last six months where i had to concentrate on each breath i took the first step in the icu without supplemental oxygen was worth the struggle i now find enormous gratification in the smallest most elemental pleasures taking my first shower after surgery was heavenly waking up in my hospital bed before dawn to the most beautiful winter landscape i have ever experienced living in colorado walking at dawn in washington park when it is still so peaceful with only the soft nuzzling sounds of the geese still snoozing and a few eager squirrels darting about sharing the experience with an occasional jogger or an early riser like myself i find myself weeping for no reason at all except in finding pure joy in my new life thanks to someone who cared enough to become a donor i weep for your family in your loss what a courageous and compassionate gesture to offer part of oneself so that someone might live we are a very active family who enjoy colorado to the fullest we hiked jogged biked swam skied and traveled together until i was about fifty four when i went on oxygen twenty four hours a day since 1996 i missed so many wonderful experiences with my family but i encouraged them not to quit doing the things we once enjoyed together many times my wife and daughter came home from a hike in tears because i was not able to share in some wonderful experience they had encountered that day well now i have nothing to hold me back and a lot to look forward to at age sixty three i feel like i am twenty again in honor of the gift from your family i am exercising daily in anticipation of hiking and the many other things i can enjoy with healthy lungs i will continue to honor my lung as long as i am able by doing my part to keep your gift alive by giving back to pay the good fortune forward and to spread the word of this blessing i will always keep your loved one and your family who gave me a second chance at life in my prayers sincerely and gratefully yours dean
4981457 stuart was always my best buddy my mentor my hero my advocate and i being bashful my spokesman he was kind and gentle never teased embarrassed or was jealous of his younger brother he included me in every thing he did of all the memories i will remember him most for always being my friend and for his eternal optimism and humor
4981458 although as ernesto guevara said friendship ends where duty starts and we are representing the venezuelan people here
4981459 we have spent a lot of time in cuba we even know the players homes it is the cuban school of the past 40 years that we stand for so we had mixed feelings in todays game
4981460 it was still a good experience we learnt a lot
4981461 i want to see that his father and brother are nihonga artists but he was western trained his style combines both the nihonga themes and western style paintings oh satoshi kun are we really going to see it if we do i could write a dissertation on his works when i start the doctoral next year
4981462 im hoping that you know that youd think a double date with nino and his girlfriend would be okay if we go see the exhibition even if they dont want to go ill take you there but i think theyll go because alys sensei thats his girlfriend likes art i can tell i only had to mention the tokyo opera city art gallery and she instantly said she wanted to see the asada hiroshi exhibition shes nice youll like her im sure she has this very clear and careful of way of speaking that i think youd like shes a bit like okaasan she got aiba to sit still if she can get aiba to be quiet and sit down she can get nino to be nicer then you dont have to worry about nino saying cutting things to you
4981463 ninomiya kun cant be as caustic as you say he is not all the time
4981464 his tongue runs away with him alys is just as bad as him but she only talks to him that way she was nice enough to rest of us but i have a feeling she can use to her words to bite when shes angry but shes really very kind she said we would all have lemon barley water tomorrow shes very giving ne but her colouring shes pale you know no makeup and shes pale i think shes very sick her hands shake you know and i dont know why she doesnt eat much either she and nino shared ramen but she let him eat most of it
4981465 she sounds interesting and very caring i would like to meet her and chiaki san too they sound like delightful women so different from my friends one sounds like a very careful thinker the other sounds like she has an eye for the picturesque wouldnt it be nice if we could all be friends
4981466 but nino first if were lucky maybe wed get to see him tomorrow after dance rehearsals in the studio and then when we get back from tour we could go to the asada exhibition
4981467 look if you want to confess your undying love for me i already know
4981468 hmm yeah i know you know and i think you should know because you always know these kinds of things and i dont know how i am going to
4981469 nothing i need you to go to ueno park with me
4981470 i want you to meet someone and you cant tell anyone else because they dont know but im telling you because i think you know and i think you know because you see a lot of things that i dont and i thought you would know because you have the sensei you know alys and she seems to know and alys said to tell you because she said it was obvious that i trusted you the most
4981471 i know i could see that she didnt tell people things that others tell her
4981472 what was it that she advised you to trust me with
4981473 whats so important at geidai its not like theyre loaning their exhibition hall to you for your work dont tell me you got yourself a sensei too
4981474 ive brought him at last kaoru my closest and best friend
4981475 she has a thyroid problem and a weak heart no doubt she finds me as exciting as i find my games
4981476 i dont know about your music and television stints but youre very ordinary
4981477 if you think im ordinary what must you think of matsujun ha ha i can just imagine thats perfectly rich not all of us are blessed with good looks
4981478 hes not handsome hes just satoshi kun with regular features like everyone else hes himself i like him for it
4981479 the guys will have no self respect left if she talks to them she thinks that youre not handsome and im ordinary kami sama knows what she thinks of the rest of the guys it will give them a great set down
4981480 everyone gets set downs at work or at school enough i think friends should encourage one another dont you
4981481 youre either a thorough innocent or a very good actress youre accomplished oh chan usually falls hard for the accomplished ones
4981482 however i can say that youve done well with kaoru chan shell manage you better than your mother if i were you oh chan i would keep kaoru chan away from alys chan i wouldnt want my girl to corrupt yours you dont know alys chan shes poisonous in every way and her temper ha let her words pierce you and youre already contaminated
4981483 its not proper to speak of your girlfriend that way
4981484 she threatens to do all kinds of things to me and she carries them out most of the time i dont want oh chan to be tortured the way my alys chan tortures me i can take it but oh chan he wouldnt survive if you insist on meeting her i think we can arrange something
4981485 after we get return from tour ne she has a conference at hiroshima too shell be busy
4981486 does this place allow us to bring back leftovers shell forget to eat if she continues like this
4981487 this mou solidifies our long standing partnership with and support for whc and their programs nssga and our members have long supported the goal of whc to increase biodiversity on corporate lands
4981488 whc also values our long term partnership with nssga and their members this agreement reinforces the industrys commitment to voluntary efforts that curb the global loss of habitat and biodiversity

4981494 naja ich habe es gar nicht als so positiv gefunden die atmosph re war so unruhig dass ich mich gar nicht auf gott und sein wort konzentrieren konnte

4981502 come on ive been playing this game for hours and this is why this is happening
4981503 the idea came to him from the irregular blinking of his left eye which eventually went blind after being struck by a champagne cork on his wedding night
4981504 whilst this was a particularly nasty offence incidents of this nature are fortunately very rare in scunthorpe

4981509 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4981510 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4981511 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4981512 weve come to a mutual conclusion on what we shall present to the leaders of the coalition government
4981513 president musharraf says he will not bow to these pressures will not quit and will defend himself
4981514 we want stability in the country we want political stability we want to make progress in the light of the mandate that has been given to our government
4981515 the construction boom and increased demand on the products and services we provide has created a large number of opportunities for saudis nationals within the construction sector in saudi readymix for example we nearly doubled our workforce over the past two years alone
4981516 to meet these demands and achieve our expansion plans we need to attract a young and ambitious workforce and we possess the necessary advantages to cultivate a rich working environment that encourages knowledge and learning for example we recently created the corporate development department which will be responsible for putting together intensive training programs for all our employees in all specialties in addition we are planning to build a large research and development center in concrete technology to elevate our industry and build the future of our country
4981517 we follow a very progressive philosophy regarding the training and education of our employees as a result the development of our employees is a prime objective for us through internationally accredited programs such as the concrete technologist amp construction certificate from the city amp guilds of london institute cgli in england and courses in the operation and maintenance of heavy duty equipment in germany in addition to several in house training courses in the end we strive to provide an exciting future for everyone who works with us
4981518 create an environment of trust and prevent any disruptive actions by the enemy
4981519 in the past week we have received numerous very disturbing reports from tourists and locals alike regarding the wholesale killing of wildlife in particular elephants
4981520 myself and a friend were trying to go to miami one weekend and it was expensive comparing it to europe which we could afford to fly to even when we were at university we joked about starting a low cost airline but then i started to seriously look into it and found strong feedback from the caribbean private and public sector
4981521 we are not from ryanair we are just students of ryanair
4981522 there are enough examples around the world that show that an air jamaica and an airone can sit together
4981523 i think that the jamaican government has always been very friendly and receptive but we understood and they made it very clear that they had a policy issue with air jamaica and that the timing was wrong we understood that and said that we would have to take the business plan to barbados but would want to come back and begin service when the time was right
4981524 intra caribbean travel is an important part of our growth because it already accounts for a four per cent share of stop overs in jamaica
4981525 i believe that there is a strong movement within the caribbean and jamaica to travel within the region people are moving to study and work on other islands and of course the whole caricom integration process helps this
4981526 what made it particularly disappointing was the empty seats in the stadiums and those seats could have been filled by people who could have bought them had air tickets been more affordable

4981534 that would be a question for nino not for me ive already met kaoru chan im very happy to hear you say that you dont care about her condition and that you want her to meet your friend it is a very very nice gesture the only question im seeing here is why are you bothering him when hes sick he should be allowed to rest think of health satoshi do you want her to catch one of those infections that have been floating around shes not as robust as you mind
4981535 ill make some nice hot chicken soup and you can bring it to the poor boy he never seems to take care of himself its high time he found himself someone who can take care of him do you think kaoru chan knows any nice girls she could introduce to him
4981536 i dont think theres anyone made to stand nino he looks cute and has nice lips but thats all
4981537 thats a very mean and tawdry way to talk about your best friend
4981538 he has many strong points he can be responsible when he wants to be and he knows how to laugh at himself not many people can
4981539 hes quick in the head ne maybe it means hell have problems finding a girl to keep up with the turns of his mind
4981540 ill be going out tomorrow evening to musashino kaorus teaching a class and i want to go see if i can learn something will you be all right on your own

4981547 okaasan nino says hes going to sleep what are we going to do about the soup
4981548 we eat it tomorrow my son what a question to ask
4981549 at times i wonder whether any of the five of you boys have any ounce of commonsense amongst you
4981550 it just means that your work is consistent consistency is always good in a person
4981551 if they didnt they wouldnt be here however theres one thing i dont understand why do they all make so much noise at an art exhibition i had to turn it off because everything was too high pitched i dont think they take art very serious maybe after tomorrow when toyomi sensei and his friends have a look well have the official post mortem
4981552 that only means the reviews will be in after the art critics have taken a good look at the exhibit
4981553 dont worry so much art always speaks for itself every piece here says that it was made with dedication believe in yourself ne i have to go class in an hour and i dont want to miss the train
4981554 remember if you dont think much of your own art you cant expect others to think much of it either text me if you want to talk ill be out of class by four today
4981555 kaoru chan liked it she has to work on an art project you cant expect her to stay out this long i already picked her up from musashino where her lesson had just ended she didnt want to come at first because she said she wasnt properly dressed the silly girl thinks she would disgrace you if she came as she was if you complain about the casual way she was dressed ill cuff your ear you hear satoshi be grateful that you have such a wonderful and understanding girlfriend who took time out of her own schedule for you next time do something nice for her dont mess this up son i like the girl and i have my heart set on her as a daughter in law
4981556 the part where it says set background concept designer for act two by morimoto kaoru
4981557 did she notice it she designed the background for act two wasnt it pretty
4981558 thats something you have to ask her come on satoshi

4981563 i was too cheap to buy you flowers so i sent myself hugs are free and better than flowers besides i brought supper left over from the set but im sure okaasama wont mind ne okaasama
4981564 its a shame to waste food especially when there are people starving elsewhere
4981565 i knew okaasama and oh chan wouldnt turn me away for supper unlike some others who persist in ignoring me despite several text messages you wouldnt ignore me would you oh chan
4981566 im sorry for thinking that you ignored me i didnt know about your hearing problem please dont stay angry with me
4981567 im not angry i was but not anymore bad day at work ne
4981568 different people do different things when theyre very stressed i throw paint on canvas from a height what do you do
4981569 youre more sanguine than i am thats a good thing
4981570 of course thats why you take life as it comes
4981571 maybe i should have asked why you were always staring at me i thought you thought there was something on my face
4981572 thats funny there must have been a mis communiqu i thought you knew i was mostly deaf because i dont like to paint with the hearing aid on
4981573 i read lips however i can hear very loud sounds sometimes and when i turn the hearing aid on
4981574 its not good for you to keep it off all the time you know you could get hurt if you cant hear things falling or dropping
4981575 embarrassing me its not like i cant take care of myself
4981576 okaasan says its gentlemanly for guys to take care of girls
4981577 she sounds like very good mother i would like to meet her sometime
4981578 ill bring her to your senseis exhibition when is that
4981579 it opens friday next week at the geidai expo hall therell be signs you wont get lost senseis name is toyomi hoshina you cant miss it its mainly oils with some mixed medium
4981580 guess ill see you on friday then sleep well okay
4981581 how many times must i tell you that eating dessert before dinner will spoil your appetite
4981582 whats the matter did ninomiya tease you about something again the boy doesnt mean it
4981583 i endured hours of labour to bring you into this world satoshi i can tell when my son protrudes his lower lip in that way that hes upset about something dont give me that look it only makes your chin look weak
4981584 eat and tell me whats troubling you if its not work its a girl how many times must okaasan tell you son sitting around and moping will not get the girl to notice you you have to say something to her smile be courteous
4981585 good that means shes not a fan of yours and shes not after the trappings of fame fortune and everything that goes with it how long as it been going on
4981586 a week maybe two i think its two you know when i had that week off i dont know
4981587 i saw her across the road you know the one between vincy art supplies and the train station with the line to musashino and geidai i called out to her but she didnt even see me then she asked me if i wanted to go to her senseis art exhibition with her but i thought she was ignoring me and so i got sulky and told her i wont go with her and now i think shes really ignoring because she said she was sorry for disturbing me and i want to see her but now i cant
4981588 i take it that you like this girl who is she
4981589 i just want to know why she ignored me when i called out to her
4981590 there is an explanation for everything perhaps she was distracted by something and couldnt hear you now tell me satoshi who is she and why havent you brought her home yet okaasan wont mind so long as the girl is respectable and accepts you for what you are
4981591 thats why i keeping telling you to think before you say or do anything
4981592 if this girl really likes you for you then she will understand that youre like this and theres nothing she can do about it if shes ignoring you because youre like this then shes very unsuitable
4981593 shes sweet and lovely and smells like bread she taught me how to mix paint and how to look at paintings and she sees what i see when i look at things but i think i know i made her angry and now shell really ignore me
4981594 there there satoshi mama knows you meant no harm so you like this girl and you only think you made her angry no one can stay angry with you for long who is she
4981595 morimoto kaoru her elder brother and sister in law run the six petals bakery her father threatened to gut me like a fish if i made her cry
4981596 what if her father decides to gut me like a fish now that i made her angry what am i going to do okaasan
4981597 morimoto morimoto is the bamboo grove fish stall in the square on the other side of this town her fathers
4981598 their fish is the freshest in the neighbourhood and rather fairly priced as well considering that the husband de scales and guts the fish for the customers all the neighbourhood obaasans patronise that shop
4981599 she helps out at the stall now and then a sweet young thing but deaf in one ear she needs a hearing device on the other ear the poor thing
4981600 so thats why she couldnt hear me when i called out to her just now
4981601 now finish dinner and go apologise to her bring her home next week i want to meet her

4981604 iya ninos blanket smelled like that when it took it to work today
4981605 for nino it is he doesnt smell like that its only the blanket that smells like that i think its strange
4981606 perhaps it soothes him you said hes been busy with a new drama series some use lavender to relieve stress perhaps for him its lily of the valley

4981618 okaasans downstairs waiting for me ill be back later maybe bye
4981619 you have very good taste honoured guests ive noticed you standing here studying this piece for a while she has a vision
4981620 the brush work is very strong and the whole changes perspectives dependent on the direction one looks at the painting it could be as hopeful or depressing as you want depending on where one looks on as the centre of the painting
4981621 work is frequently evocative of the feelings of despair but with this
4981622 she has incorporated depth of the possibility of sound in the area of sight she has another piece featured over there a photographic self portrait
4981623 she wanted to juxtapose the beauty of art with the suffering the artist has to endure before gaining any recognition however from that smile she also reveals that the artist does not care for just any recognition but that of the art itself morimoto kun has potential ive recommended that she advance to the doctoral programme in the next year mark my words she will be one of this countrys leading contemporary artists
4981624 she will be pleased to hear the praise from you personally
4981625 kobayashi kun her hearing aid is on today bring her over
4981626 morimoto kun i wasnt sure you could hear me from that distance even if your ear piece is on your work has drawn a discerning admirer already
4981627 toyomi sensei dont tease me like that my work cant compare to yours yet give me another ten years and maybe ill catch up

4981648 he caught himself and started again at one time there was a president named ronald reagan who spoke very strongly about americas advocacy for democracy and freedom
4981649 the extent of mccains involvement in the military conflict in georgia appears remarkable among presidential candidates who traditionally have kept some distance from unfolding crises out of deference to whoever is occupying the white house

4981692 in our time political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible
4981693 for the power of man to make himself what he pleases means as we have seen the power of some men to make other men what they please
4981694 our liberties do not come from charters for these are only the declaration of pre existing rights
4981695 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness
4981696 it is impossible to further the common good without acknowledging and defending the right to life upon which all the other inalienable rights of individuals are founded and from which they develop
4981697 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class

4981705 im a federalist i believe that states should make those decisions in my state i hope we will make that decision in other states they have to recognize the unique status of marriage between man and woman

4981714 this feeling is truly amazing and its a massive relief i can open the champagne now and rightfully so
4981715 there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4981716 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible
4981717 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4981718 any time jeremiah wright appears in conjunction with the discussion of race it cannot help the campaign of barack obama not for a nanosecond
4981719 there is a complete disconnect between the message of rev wright and the perception of mainstream white americans this explains why as jeremiah wright has risen in terms of news media coverage barack obamas popularity has fallen in the polls
4981720 if i were barack obama i would be very bitter that rev wright continues to cling to the public and media spotlight
4981721 i dont think wright helped or hurt obama anymore than he already has with his speech at the freedom dinner
4981722 fairly or unfairly i think that wright has become one of those public figures that people either love or hate theres just not going to be a lot folks who are in the mushy middle on wright and because of that the amount of help or harm he can do for obama is limited to what has already happened
4981723 however youve got to think that the john mccain folks are loving the picture of wright and mayor kwame kilpatrick thats been published
4981724 youre kidding yourself if you dont think thats going to be used by mccain at some point to drive a wedge between obama and older white voters especially in the older detroit suburbs if obama is the nominee
4981725 marginally but i dont think obama was hurt that much by the reverends remarks in the first place at least not yet
4981726 and it must get very tiresome for wright to hear and read repeatedly that everything he has said and done throughout his life must now be viewed through the prism of one of his parishoners candidacy for public office
4981727 wright has every right to speak out now and defend himself against some of the scurrilous characterizations of his words and sermons
4981728 we could go to any of martin luther king jr s sermons back in the 50s and 60s and extract sound bites and regurgitate them out of context in a way that would make them appear as outrageous as anything wright has said
4981729 unless a lot of the signatures are thrown out it appears a recall may well occur
4981730 id still give speaker dillon about 2 1 odds to survive that is he has about twice as much chance to beat the rap as to be thrown out of office
4981731 if the recall is held in august however thats more than three months away and a lot can happen between now and then
4981732 i think it would be somewhat of a victory for the petitioners to get this on the ballot because it will get major statewide publicity and give anti tax conservatives mainly republicans something to rally around for a good portion of the election season whether dillon is recalled or not it will also ramp up the pressure on pro tax incumbents running for re election in other districts
4981733 i believe drolet will hand in enough signatures to put the recall on the ballot but dillon will defeat the recall in the election and then win re election and stay in the legislature
4981734 if all it took to recall someone was signatures i think hed be done a recall requires a vote however and the house democrats have more than 1 million in the bank and a lot of staff and establishment resources available to fight the effort drolet and mta face a tough tough road
4981735 if the recall effort were really registering with voters you would assume drolet would have success in other districts but hes not
4981736 the irony in all of this of course is that if it does get on the ballot drolet will end up costing the taxpayers thousands and thousands of dollars for what will end up being a futile exercise
4981737 only because i dont think either side on either issue has been able to cut through to the general public with their simplified narrative to date whether its been jobs versus choice on the energy side or long term viability for blue cross blue shield versus insurance competition on the insurance market reform side until one side or the other can start getting some traction with their simplified narrative with voters beyond the capitol community i just think voters will tend to have glazed over looks on their faces when these issues come up
4981738 only if passage of either or both sends a message to voters that theyre destined to be walloped by increased utility rates or insurance costs
4981739 but of course theres no way voters are actually going to feel the pain of such projected cost hikes in their pocketbooks before the nov 4 general election therefore its unlikely to have an effect unless one party or the other or individual candidates can figure out a way to package a message involving pro blue cross or pro utility votes that makes the votes look like part of a pattern in their opponents political behavior that should be punished at the polls
4981740 these issues in and of themselves will not be factors in the election
4981741 they will not have any statistically significant effect the public perception of these types of issues is garbled the only time the public really reacts on these kinds of issues is later on if theyre affected negatively
4981742 unless one of these packages is tie barred to a cut in the income tax or a repeal of the mbt surcharge neither will be major issues this fall
4981743 tax hikes will be the focus thats the houses record thats the legacy of the democrat majority that will be the issue that will affect the upcoming election
4981744 its a classic case of it sure sounded good when i signed the petition but i didnt know it would do that
4981745 once voters realize that this proposal hires the same people who shutdown the government and raised everyones taxes to set up a health care plan for everyone in michigan the proposals days are numbered
4981746 i know the conspiracy theorists dont want to believe this but this effort really wasnt started as a way to drive turn out in the general election or to persuade certain voters or any of the other reasons ive heard people claim is the real motive behind it
4981747 it was simply a group of folks who believed that this was the best way under the circumstances to move the ball forward on the healthcare issue
4981748 even saying that it would be naive to think its not going to have some effect on the electorate this fall and because of that people on both sides of the issue are going to be monitoring things pretty closely
4981749 john freeman is an excellent organizer and he understands better than most what needs to happen on the ground in this type of campaign due to that i think youre going to see a lot of the traditional democratic support groups become more engaged with the proposal once its officially on the ballot at the same time freeman has been pretty aggressive in courting the business community along with the health professional community to build bipartisan and wide ranging support for the proposal it may end up being one of those campaigns with strange bedfellows where everybody tries to take credit for their own purposes
4981750 id say the same dynamics that were behind the effort in 2002 to get all the money from the states tobacco settlement earmarked for health care rather than going to merit awards or other programs
4981751 efforts by interest groups be they health related educational insurance or whatever to amend the constitution to guarantee taxpayer funding for their particular commodity will always be with us that doesnt mean the voters should support such proposals and fortunately they usually dont
4981752 i guess i really dont know enough about whats behind it to comment on the political angle
4981753 usually the proponents of these kinds of thing have a vested interest even if its just to bring attention to a certain issue in our channel surfing society most people just arent paying attention and so sometimes a lot of noise has to made just to get their attention

4981791 im finding out more and more families have gone through the same thing and theres just got to be a stop to it
4981792 it is no longer the issue of land in the jammu region or that of fruit transportation in the valley aijay hussain a local journalist told ians
4981793 the dangerous dimensions taken by the agitations in the jammu region and the valley plainly indicate the jammuites want secession from the valley and the valley wants secession from the rest of the country
4981794 mirwaiz umer farooq and syed ali geelani two iconic leaders of the separatist movement in kashmir were taken out by crowds to lead the funeral procession of the slain hurriyat leader sheikh abdul aziz
4981795 the huge crowds defied both the restrictions imposed by the authorities and also the appeals by the separatist leaders to remain peaceful
4981796 they continued curfew in jammu for days and only four people died there in firing by the security forces in just two days more than 17 people have been killed here by the security forces and dozens injured with bullets who are now admitted in various hospitals do you call this even handed treatment
4981797 there is a bandh called by the vhp vishwa hindu parishad in force outside the valley today what does this mean i dont think it would be easy for anybody to reinstill the previous confidence between the two regions of the state
4981798 let us not indulge in self deceit jammu wants to break from the valley and the people here want to break from the rest of the country if journalists do not give the real picture they would only be cheating themselves and those who read them

4981805 damage was sustained to the right frontal and middle section of the hood
4981806 in my opinion the accident did not occur due to the wheel or brakes
4981807 ms mcalister was uncooperative and refused to produce identification or insurance information it was a good amount of time before she finally gave the documents to me
4981808 talking to others and acting as if the accident didnt occur
4981809 the section of tiger creek road is actually private road and not subject to vehicle codes as public roads
4981810 if private property is damaged on a private road there is usually no report but due to ms mcalisters uncooperative nature and based upon my judgment i documented the accident
4981811 her inconsistent statements her mental instability and the demeanor she displayed toward law enforcement on the day of the accident show she is a danger to herself and we ask you to revoke bail

4981842 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4981843 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4981854 vorrei oggi proporre unaltra intenzione per cui pregare date le notizie che giungono specialmente in questo periodo di numerosi e gravi incidenti stradali non dobbiamo abituarci a questa triste realt
4981855 troppo prezioso infatti il bene della vita umana osserva il papa nel corso dellangelus recitato dalla residenza estiva di castel gandolfo e troppo indegno delluomo morire o ritrovarsi invalido per cause che nella maggior parte dei casi si potrebbero evitare
4981856 anzitutto da parte degli automobilisti perch gli incidenti sono dovuti spesso alleccessiva velocit e a comportamenti imprudenti
4981857 condurre un veicolo sulle pubbliche strade prosegue il papa richiede senso morale e senso civico a promozione di questultimo indispensabile la costante opera di prevenzione vigilanza e repressione da parte delle autorit preposte come chiesa invece ci sentiamo direttamente interpellati sul piano etico i cristiani devono prima di tutto fare un esame di coscienza personale sulla propria condotta di automobilisti le comunit inoltre conclude ratzinger educhino tutti a considerare anche la guida un campo in cui difendere la vita ed esercitare concretamente lamore del prossimo
4981858 si tratta ha detto prima della preghiera dellangelus di manifestazioni preoccupanti legate spesso a problemi sociali e economici che tuttavia mai possono giustificare il disprezzo e la discriminazione razziale serve una reciproca accoglienza di tutti
4981859 soprattutto nel nostro tempo che ogni comunit cristiana approfondisca sempre pi questa sua consapevolezza al fine di aiutare anche la societ civile a superare ogni possibile tentazione di intolleranza

4981889 over the past 2 years viet nam has shown some moderate improvement in overall transparency moving up one tier within our global index from opaque to low transparency
4981890 improvement particularly in the regulatory and legal environment with respect to real estate investment and law has been primarily responsible for this change
4981891 it is important to note that transparency enhancements should not be viewed as the sole determinant of regional capital flows instead market fundamentals appear to be the main driving force behind transaction volumes
4981892 nevertheless higher transparency is resulting in a more dispersed flow of capital between countries across the region

4981900 we have only just arrived so we are just letting everything sink in at the moment
4981901 i have seen a couple of friends and i have a couple of hours to kill i have come here to play a great show
4981902 it is a comprehensive report and the minister will need time to review it
4981903 we are confident mr martin has done everything that has been asked of him and he was part of a chain of command
4981904 as far as we are concerned he has followed all the guidelines and it has now been almost six months and we still havent been given an indication of what is in that report
4981905 for me its to get more of an idea of what we could do for a wedding its good to have everything in the one place
4981906 couples are older its not unusual to shoot a wedding where people have already bought their home and have their careers up and going
4981907 people not only want to be married they want something special and unique about it it makes it great for us photographers its a lot more relaxed and creative
4981908 there has been interest from border to border even from tasmania
4981909 the purpose is to provide a forum for rural women to express concerns they might have as there will be a level of government representation
4981910 its about capacity and community building at a local level and a forum for women to do things they wouldnt normally have an opportunity to do outside metropolitan areas
4981911 if we can understand more about what drives their behaviour their psychological development and their health and well being then we are better placed to keep them well
4981912 i think its an interesting study particularly as its focusing on rural students
4981913 i hope that the results offer some advice and guidance for parents
4981914 for parents its such an unknown area wed like to know what triggers their behaviour
4981915 the more we understand how students learn and the effects of outside factors the more our students and teachers benefit

4981920 madonna detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother it showed a side of her that made her very human
4981921 but i think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him
4981922 dard e sherlyn too has become successful she felt that only a decent price could keep her inside the house for three months
4981923 right from the beginning of her career sherlyn has a very bold outspoken daring and sensational diva like image one cant really blame her for thinking of her colourful bikinis
4981924 nowadays everyone from kareena kapoor to priyanka chopra is being talked about for wearing bikinis in their movies so why should we have double standards for reality shows after all they are just another medium of expression
4981925 the things one has to do for ones brother but seriously c kkompany is an important film for tusski normally id do nothing to promote our films but this one is for my kid brother
4981926 when he tusshar asked me to make an appearance in the film i agreed then i made an exception and appeared on the reality show with him
4981927 tusshar has a release my cousin gattu abhishek kapoor has directed rock on that too releases aug 29 as tusshars c kkompany
4981928 both my brothers will have to gift me something special for raksha bandhan and the quality of the gift would depend on whose film is a bigger hit
4981929 we believe aafia has been in custody ever since she disappeared
4981930 and were not willing to believe that the discovery of aafia in afghanistan is coincidence

4981941 poverty and backwardness are my enemies i will fight against them
4981942 i would have committed a historical blunder had i not entered politics
4981943 essentially sodium bicarbonate is an alkali substance that increases the ph of the blood
4981944 very very unfair and uncharitable comment against the nation and the majority community
4981945 nowhere in the world minorities get such importance than in india
4981946 we have done everything that had to be done and now we expect the nsg exemption without any change to the draft that was circulated to them recently
4981947 we expect the process to move consistent with the july 18 2005 understanding and any change in their nsg position is problematic
4981948 we can not agree to further demands and there is no way we can
4981949 it is difficult to make out from the video footages about his bowling the more you play the more comfortable you will get
4981950 you have to take chances against him in the sense you got to make sure when he bowls a loose delivery you get the most out of it so that you can put pressure on the bowler of course inputs from sehwag and gambhir they would really help
4981951 in any form of cricket whether in test cricket or one dayers the start is very important but it does not mean the entire pressure is on the openers to always give you a good start sehwag is sort of a player who takes a bit of risk
4981952 of course it is crucial he is in a very good nick he and gautam gambhir have played well in the test series also of course they will have some added responsibility but no real pressure
4981953 some dignitaries have arrived here to mediate a saudi royal air force plane is parked at chaklala air base so the matter could be a day or two
4981954 some foreign dignitaries might have arrived but we dont know and none of the foreign visitors contacted mr zardari
4981955 our position is very clear that its up to the coalition and parliament to decide on the issue
4981956 the draft has been given a final shape and by tomorrow or the day after itll be presented to the coalition leadership and hopefully an impeachment motion with charge sheet will be moved this week
4981957 we are not interested in politics of vendetta we want political stability and the governments focus should be on the peoples betterment
4981958 the countdown has begun we are all set to fly to london from bangalore on september 3
4981959 these things definitely wont make the same kind of pretty pictures on the sky that previous stream discoveries did
4981960 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
4981961 moderation in temper is always a virtue but moderation in principle is always a vice
4981962 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4981963 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4981964 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4981965 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4981966 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4981967 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4981968 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4981969 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4981970 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4981971 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4981972 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4981973 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4981974 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4981975 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4981976 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4981977 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4981978 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4981979 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4981980 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4981981 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4981982 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4981983 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
4981984 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
4981985 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
4981986 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
4981987 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
4981988 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
4981989 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
4981990 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
4981991 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4981992 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4981993 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4981994 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4981995 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4981996 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4981997 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
4981998 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
4981999 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
4982000 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4982001 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4982002 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4982003 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4982004 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4982005 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
4982006 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
4982007 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
4982008 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
4982009 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine
4982010 try not to become a man of success but rather try to become a man of value
4982011 and now he cant feel the warmth of a human touch
4982012 and now he cant feel the warmth of a human touch
4982013 and now he cant feel the warmth of a human touch

4982020 was signed at a time of a very difficult crisis in relations between russia and the us over the situation in georgia shows that of course the missile defence system will be deployed not against iran but against the strategic potential of russia
4982021 the us is concerned with its own anti missile defence not polands but poland by deploying the shield will be exposed to attack
4982022 in view of america s determination to set up a missile defense shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response said the source
4982023 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike
4982024 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them

4982052 we hear all the time the message that exercise is important and yet many of us dont take any notice
4982053 what we have found is that the person delivering the message needs to be someone the audience identifies with and respects in order to bring about a desired change in behaviour

4982061 he should be sick after leaving mama so upset she loves him and when shes sick he doesnt even email her he cant treat her like that
4982062 magnificent apology going to your girlfriends apartment complex ne standing at the bottom of her window calling her keitai ne and asking her for the time and telling her youre there because you are there eh whoever wrote the script to that drama should be clubbed with a golf club ne
4982063 a nine iron should be about right for ninos head
4982064 sho kun emergency alys is on the line she wants to know managers home number
4982065 feverish ohno kun see that aiba chan gets home safely
4982066 do you want to stay here i can stay here with you
4982067 hes with alys shes clever shed know what to do until sho and the rest get there
4982068 ne riida do you think nino finally sees that shes perfect
4982069 no one is perfect aiba chan nino knows that alys knows that
4982070 ne riida why would he go see mama if he was going to collapse
4982071 does nino love her you think i know he likes her but does he love her because i can see she loves him you know that time at the ramen place she only took a few bites and gave him the rest when he wants to drink she will give him her cup i can see how she looks at him then whenever i phone her to ask questions she will always ask whether ninos eating and sleeping okay before she disconnects the call nino doesnt look at her in the same way she looks at him he looks at her like he looks at you from behind his game with that evil smirk what if he treats mama badly again
4982072 riida am i very bad to be jealous of nino
4982073 jealous because he has a girlfriend dont let sho hear you hell laugh at you you know daijoubu shos very silly and he got a girlfriend youll get a girlfriend too if you meet a nice girl
4982074 you dont understand i think i love mama and it hurts riida it really hurts i dont like it when she cries because she quarrelled with nino mama shouldnt have to cry mama should be laughing and teaching stuff to people but its painful when she cries it hurts here
4982075 the insides there go squish squish so hard and so quickly that it hurts
4982076 then ill tell him that i dont like it when he ignores her with his ugh and the way he tosses his hand like he doesnt care i dont like it when nino says things like he doesnt need her
4982077 riida am i very bad to be angry with nino he cant see that mamas really pretty in the old fashioned traditional way he talks about her like shes nothing special but she is and whats worse is that i love her and i know she doesnt love me like she loves nino i cant stand seeing her with nino or asking about nino im very bad ne riida what am i going to do it hurts and i dont know what to do
4982078 aww shh just cry it all out youll feel better okaasan always says so
4982079 you cant help how you feel just cry it all out
4982080 i dont like myself right now i want to see mama now but i know i shouldnt because shes busy with nino now that hes fainted i really dislike myself
4982081 someone once told me that if you dont like yourself you cant expect other people to like you
4982082 it is good news for him yes however he must still be smarting from the fact that she hasnt so much as asked for him
4982083 he doesnt know she doesnt want us to tell him
4982084 he cant go see her if he doesnt know shes ill
4982085 im going to see him to see if he wants to go see her maybe he does i think i know he does hes been going everywhere with the yellow buttoned blanket she gave him
4982086 tell him the truth about alys and let him know that shes been ill and that shes thinking of him tell him that she wants to see him but doesnt know how to say it the type where you have to use the soft approach instead of forcing him to do something that will set him thinking and he would go see her just to check up on things on his own the trick with him is to do things in such a way that he thinks hes doing what he does because he wants to
4982087 only time will tell but you should see him to let him know that his friends care and worry about him and when you do see him bring in the topic of alys slowly its like adding a layer of paint slowly over the old coat do you see
4982088 if anyone can gently push nino kun in the right direction its you because you can see the shadows as well as the light
4982089 nino chan you didnt see me i didnt want to come but kaoru said i should because you had to know but the guys while they want you to know they feel that you shouldnt know because it was said to be a promise not to let you know
4982090 if the guys found out they wouldnt like because it would be like i didnt respect her wishes and told you what she told us not to you
4982091 but now that im not with her we can have more alone time just you and me oh chan chocolates flowers midnight strolls and yelling obscenities at sho
4982092 but you need to see alys the sensei shes been in hospital
4982093 she always said i would be the death of her is she dead yet
4982094 she was discharged this morning something about an epi epi something seizure
4982095 she must have allowed her students to agitate her she never learns to just let them be
4982096 jun was with her when it happened she made him and us promise not to tell you when we said we wanted to
4982097 that you shouldnt have told me if youve made a promise
4982098 she didnt rest you know the whole time she was laid up she asked for her lesson notes and books she gave a lesson by teleconferencing and spent her free time writing or listening to european music where people sing in high voices and crying
4982099 either tears of guilt or regret women are good at those things
4982100 shes well enough to teach from her sick bed and free enough to cry while listening to tragic operas then she doesnt miss anything except maybe sleeping in her own bed
4982101 manager met her you know he likes her said that she was a clever woman said that even the boss would like her he said he could see that she didnt tell other people things she had been told she made him laugh
4982102 we all make him laugh at times its not that difficult
4982103 i still think you should see her there ive told you kaoru said i should i should go home or okasan will be worried you should really go see her nino
4982104 riida daiseiko you got them to see each other youre truly great at last riida does something marvellous

4982107 im paranoid im paranoid thats what it does to you its just a chemical imbalance nothing more
4982108 it was an advantage to be more anxious in a dangerous environment
4982109 the number of dead zones has approximately doubled each decade since the 1960s
4982110 ninos going to make a mess of things if he sees her in this mood
4982111 shes not going to be pleased to see him either we cant just sit around idly while this is ongoing nino and alys san will be at each others throats and then we will really be in trouble
4982112 its been three days i cant imagine that the philosophy department or todai has been kind to her
4982113 how about we meet at my place at noon well discuss what is to be done sho kun see if chiaki can spare us some of her time we may have to send her to alys sensei if nino does something stupid it may be easier for her to talk to another woman than to one of us
4982114 shes really clever enough nino doesnt know it but she is

4982150 men usually gamble with their lives lots of women too face physical risks but more typically the emphasis in their stories is on the threatened loss of their sanity and their sense of self the struggles described in literature are often internal and psychological rather than life and death contests in technicolor

4982174 it is possible to imagine the world economy becoming less integrated it has happened before the fairly free world economy of the late 19th century was riddled with protectionism by the 1930s
4982175 the wto discussions in geneva have confirmed that the balance of power in global trade has shifted irrevocably with the rise of china

4982184 were very proud of him we were always very proud of him
4982185 its one of the first trophies uncle duncan won as an athlete
4982186 we are not quite sure what he won it for its been a treasure in my parents home and my aunts home and now i have it
4982187 i think he may have had to fudge his age at some point in time because we came across so many dates but we went with what was in the parish records
4982188 at the time he was considered one of the greatest athletes of his day
4982189 before the 1912 olympics the new york times did a profile on athletes to watch at the stockholm olympics the only canadian mentioned was duncan gillis and that is why he carried the flag
4982190 were just a small community and when someone from here does well we just latch onto it
4982191 we came out of the stadium just absolutely stunned at the magic and completely inspired at the opportunity that we have to go off and think and dream
4982192 our goal of course will be to be just as inspiring
4982193 despite the heat and humidity the entire stadium was riveted
4982194 they couldnt have done a better job i dont think
4982195 were still in the planning phase for sure but thats why this is so critical to learn the lessons that we see in beijing to make it a better experience here in vancouver for 2010
4982196 id like the world to feel think they know a little more about canada as our opening ceremonies close
4982197 its canadas olympics its canadas opportunity to remind the world what were going to be in the 21st century

4982211 it would be better to die in our own motherland
4982212 our relatives were being forced to write these letters out of fear and that returnees are actually getting killed
4982213 we have a very big family so we felt safe there were so many of us in afghanistan that we knew we could protect each other
4982214 there are certain tajiks in afghanistan whose lives would be in danger if they were to return to tajikistan because of the role they played in the civil war these people are afraid that if the majority of refugees returns to tajikistan those remaining will be so few in number that united nations high commissioner for refugees and other international assistance will disappear so theyspread false information that scares people and keeps them in afghanistan
4982215 the unhcr was going to continue to supply food until the fall but that we would be on our own after that
4982216 nothing has happened to me since i returned four months ago but that is because i have not left the village once i know that the kulabis assume that i was a fighter simply because i fled to afghanistan i cant take the risk of walking around kurgan teppe city because i am afraid they will beat me up or maybe something worse
4982217 they were armed but they did not use their arms they were shouting at us that we were vovchiki opposition fighters the police came around afterwards they asked questions and said that these people had just been drunk but they were not drunk it was only 4 p m
4982218 certain circumstances must be present in order for government organs such as the police to perform their functions as long as there is unrest on the border 37 these organs have to attend to that unrest and cannot fulfill their duties now if the cease fire is observed things will change
4982219 i tried to take our case to court about a year ago but the people who are occupying our house found out and they beat me and threatened me i am a widow and i am scared i would rather continue to live with relatives even if we are cramped than to risk that again
4982220 there is a very powerful kulabi occupying my house even the local officials dont dare to try to make him leave what kind of system is this if those who are powerful or armed can continue to break the law
4982221 even if there is a legal order to evict someone from a home if that person has strong connections or is armed why would he feel that he needed to comply
4982222 the kulabis who took him were not from the government but the authoritiesknow this is going on of course they have no interest in stopping it
4982223 reprimanded security forces and police at checkpoints and told them they must respect people we have a problem intajikistan because no one receives salaries we need time to train the forces at the checkpoints and punish these people
4982224 when we came back from afghanistan the uzbeks had looted and burned all of our homes you ask about occupied homes but there are none here they were all destroyed
4982225 we were brought here forcibly from gharm in the 1950s by stalin to work in the cotton fields our children were born here now the uzbeks say that we should return to gharm
4982226 everything is calm between tajiks and uzbeks here the uzbeks are definitely in charge but they bother us less than the kulabis
4982227 they were screaming that we should leave this area the kolkhoz authorities who are all uzbek did nothing to stop the violence if the police had not been brought in the uzbeks would have killed people
4982228 the incident was started by the tajiks and people on both sides were injured but people came from the oblast level to encourage peacemaking and now there are no problems here between tajiks and uzbeks
4982229 the government has already disarmed the opposition so now the rest of the population has to be disarmed
4982230 we fled across the valley but we could see what was happening some houses were on fire and others were being looted in our village nine homes out of forty were completely destroyed the other homes were damaged or looted when we came back there was nothing left
4982231 the only way we have to survive is by selling apples but we have no gasoline or vehicles to transport the apples to dushanbe even when we do they are confiscated from us by the soldiers at the checkpoints and it is not worth while to make the trip
4982232 for each of our brothers fighting in the army who is killed well kill one of you
4982233 we cant even protect our own citizens how do you expect us to guarantee the safety of afghans or assume responsibility for them

4982237 were not looking to cut back were looking to drill for more oil offshore and in alaska and in anybodys backyard where we can sniff some out a majority of americans agree and both candidates running for president have endorsed it
4982238 even though that offshore oil is ten years or more away we want it
4982239 drilling for more oil now is like applying anti itch powder for a skin cancer rash
4982240 dude im telling you that if you are still using oil in ten years the way you do today
4982241 then you will have sentenced yourselves to the gas chamber that now surrounds the earth and it will be a classic example of choosing to punish yourself you dont actually need a crystal ball to see it coming marching into the gas chamber youll make it more modern and convenient by offering the drive through option with your choice of ipod playlist

4982244 ill tell you whats dumber than a bag of hammers and more extreme than the x games
4982245 and that is to care more about the cost of gasoline today than the far higher costs to every single person you claim to care about and love
4982246 those costs will be paid before that off shore oil ever fills anybodys gas tank
4982247 ten years from now your kids are going to want to suffocate you in your sleep for being so selfish and stupid when you still had the chance to save them
4982248 well that just goes to show how much you really know

4982281 its endurance its strength its pressure he made the pressure putt in the u s open he won the tour de france and he knocked out the best fighter in the world in the 16th round with an uppercut
4982282 he did absolutely everything sport is supposed to be and he did it with a smile on his face and hes a good kid
4982283 the only thing that i would have wanted to change
4982284 was the 200 fly i think i can go faster in that event it was a wardrobe malfunction but it was something we took care of and we were able to fix
4982285 other than that i think this was a perfect week
4982286 hes beginning to set a whole new standard for his sport and for america

4982295 wittgenstein showed us how many other paths there are than just two
4982296 hard to understand why weininger is generally taken to be nothing but a solemn zealous and bigoted stickler for nasty and stupid principles
4982297 let us call the weininger a priori absolute and ascribe the concept of a relative a priori to wittgenstein

4982335 there is nothing to suggest at this early stage that the incident was gang related

4982343 in any form of cricket whether in test cricket or one dayers the start is very important but it does not mean the entire pressure is on the openers to always give you a good start sehwag is sort of a player who takes a bit of risk
4982344 of course it is crucial he is in a very good nick he and gautam gambhir have played well in the test series also of course they will have some added responsibility but no real pressure

4982348 then youve not only accepted an unnecessarily complicated and unintuitive way of describing the language but youve also made it impossible for yourself to think clearly about how the words
4982349 clearly contain different forms of the verb but they look identical in
4982350 and most other verbs they are the same form but when you try to describe how the language works youll find its useful to give them different names so that you can name the forms that belong in

4982380 ever since i heard the news i cant tell you how excited ive been
4982381 its a good system for me to play in to play for a coach that was a point guard himself i enjoyed it under nate mcmillan and im going to enjoy it under coach skiles its just his competitiveness and toughness ill try to bring that to the court
4982382 one way or another we are going to be a much better defensive team
4982383 right behind that we want to be a good rebounding team and we want to push the ball in that order
4982384 thats two out of three there not that luke cant scrap around for some rebounds the first person who receives that outlet pass the decision they make right there is critical hes always been a very good decision maker
4982385 we want to push that ball we want to look at early offense then if we dont get anything settle into our offense
4982386 the connection the supersonics had with rashard lewis ray allen and luke comes over here with michael redd and richard jefferson
4982387 andrew bogut is going to get more touches inside and thats great for team chemistry
4982388 the other part of it is scott is going to know he has an extension of himself out on the floor hes going to have a guy who knows the offensive sets and knows who to get the ball to at the right time
4982389 i think we have a good combination to make ourselves very good at the point guard position
4982390 youve got luke who is in the prime of his career at 27 years old youve got the veteran backup in ty lue who has been in almost every situation possible hes always been a great teammate and hes going to be supportive of luke and ramon
4982391 and with ramon we have a good young piece who has value in this league and a piece we want to keep here long term
4982392 hes the kind of guy people like to play with
4982393 when you classify him theres no discussion hes a point guard
4982394 obviously you dont trade a starting point guard and not acquire a piece capable of filling that position
4982395 when you evaluate our team here its not to say michael redd and richard jefferson are ray allen and rashard lewis but if you put luke ridnour in our lineup and have michael redd on one wing and richard jefferson on the other wing it puts him in a position to be as successful as he was in the past
4982396 i think from a personnel standpoint weve improved our roster
4982397 were a better team than we were three months ago the second part of it is we did have some financial issues that needed to be addressed
4982398 we cannot allow this burmese regime to prosper financially while they continue to violate the human rights of their own people
4982399 this bill hits the burmese leaders where it hurts in the wallet its our hope that these sanctions will push other countries to examine their own financial dealings with burma
4982400 these brutal actions demonstrate the regimes moral bankruptcy but unfortunately it is far from financially bankrupt
4982401 the blood color of rubies not only brings than shwes military regime 300 million per year it signifies all the blood lost by innocent civilians in our struggle for human rights
4982402 we want to thank the united states congress for taking strong and meaningful action
4982403 the higher prices of gold have made illegal mining become an issue in areas where there wasnt any problem before
4982404 high commodity prices and declining resources around them artisanal miners in other areas are going to mean this is a growing phenomenon in many countries
4982405 companies have realized this is their biggest social problem and it is growing all the time there are mines that are getting 6 000 people illegal miners on their sites a week
4982406 the illegal miners are all from burkina faso togo and benin and even cote divoire ivory coast now too they are not poor locals
4982407 they are mostly men aged between 15 and 40 and there is a real cowboy macho culture that exists around them
4982408 instead of earning 1 a day by farming the land people prefer to earn 2 3 by standing in a river these miners often do not fully benefit from higher world prices because they usually live in remote areas where one buyer dominates the market and they cannot afford to stockpile
4982409 the tragedy in all this is that the smaller miner is not being lifted out of poverty
4982410 it is the financier and the chain of middle people who are involved who are making more of the money
4982411 in the democratic republic of congo as the war finished in the northeast a lot of the youth were militia they put down the gun and it was easy to take up the spade and start digging
4982412 that is why the situation is particularly fragile for those who want to get rid of artisanal mining there is a high chance they will put down the spade and pick up the gun
4982413 the problems are bonded labor exploitation of the workers safety and the environment
4982414 in places like ghana we are not armed but when our security encounter a group of 30 to 40 people with machetes and clubs we have incidents
4982415 the risk of this becoming a more common event is certainly there
4982416 once they are formalized and operate under a regulatory umbrella then we can go in and provide them with equipment and provide them with loans and so on
4982417 if we look at the issue pragmatically what needs to be done is that these companies have to free up areas they are not using and that is not happening
4982418 we must also find solution to the problem of fake kp certificates it undermines the very core of what kpcs wants to achieve the problem must be addressed

4982433 the judges clearly understood the issues at stake in this case when they rejected the plaintiffs demand for special treatment

4982435 the kpcs is a voluntary system nobody is forcing venezuela to be a member if it wants to assist in the fight against the conflict diamonds that ravaged africa that is good if it wants to be a respected member of the worlds diamond producing and trading countries that too is good but it must meet kpcs minimum standards
4982436 venezuela has blatantly rejected several administrative decisions calling for kp peer review visits venezuela should stop wasting the time of the kimberley process and the kimberley process should stop wasting its own time on venezuela kp ineptitude sends a disastrous message to other countries for whom participation is expensive and time consuming the kimberley process must now expel venezuela from its ranks

4982443 just a few weeks ago predictions of arctic ice collapse were buzzing all over the internet
4982444 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4982445 the arctic melt season is nearly done for this year the sun is now very low above the horizon and will set for the winter at the north pole in five weeks and none of these dire predictions have come to pass yet there is however something odd going on with the ice data
4982446 the national snow and ice data center nsidc in boulder colorado released an alarming graph on august 11 showing that arctic ice was rapidly disappearing back towards last years record minimum
4982447 arctic ice extent was 30 per cent greater on august 11 2008 than it was on the august 12 2007 2008 is a leap year so the dates are offset by one
4982448 the nsidc graph appears to disagree with the maps by a factor of three 10 per cent vs 30 per cent hardly a trivial discrepancy
4982449 the arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by nsidc and the norwegian polar year secretariat

4982451 agnes sat at her desk and thought even the umbrellas mock me seven umbrellas stood propped at the door but only six of them were wet hers played the oddball
4982452 dont you see the umbrellas are a metaphor they really were mocking her
4982453 you have to read between the lines she was a secretary obviously it was raining that day but if all the umbrellas were wet except for hers she must have gotten to work before the storm
4982454 not as bad as it is sad theyre umbrellas theyre supposed to get wet not only is she the first one to get into the office but she had to carry protection that she didnt even need
4982455 the movie is second place so far as we are concerned being accepted by cooperstown was the greatest thing that happened to any of us

4982465 there will be no problem about a new contract for gary
4982466 he will be up for a new deal you can be sure about that because hes a remarkable person
4982467 the way he has come back after 18 months is remarkable and to then play to the level he played against portsmouth last sunday was perfect

4982471 its a wonderful day for jamaica it was a stunning performance and were so proud of you
4982472 the games are not yet over and we expect a lot more from the team in the days ahead but i can assure you that we are planning a massive welcome home party for all of you
4982473 we have chances in the mens 200m womens 200m the womens 100m hurdles the mens 400m hurdles the womens 400m and all four relays
4982474 so we have a lot of expectations that there are more medals to be won
4982475 i knew he had it in him i cant wait for him to break the 200m record and then run 42 seconds in the 400m
4982476 he has taken jamaica on his back and demolished the whole world that is the respect to be given to the greatest sprinter of all time
4982477 it was euphoria it was the greatest feeling ive had in all my life because jamaica has never had the joy and glory of a gold medal in the 100m sprint in my 60 years
4982478 and in addition to getting our first gold he broke the world record it is an experience that is almost unspeakable it brought me out in goose bumps
4982479 that wasnt just my feeling but the whole of jamaica i got reports from the districts and cities back home where people were out on the streets hailing the victory
4982480 it was good old vintage reggae it was tremendous of the organisers they were able to find a piece of music that helped us celebrate
4982481 we are expecting at least another five medals from the track and we feel very confident if we do that then i would not be surprised if we declared a national holiday
4982482 its ridiculous to say he was disrespectful in the way he finished
4982483 hes a young athlete hes having a great time and this sport of all sports needs that hes carefree hes got the talent he did not do it in a disrespectful way he is just excited about his sport
4982484 when bolt broke the world record at the national championships and at all the championships in which he has participated in between he and the other jamaican sprinters have been tested
4982485 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
4982486 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4982487 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4982488 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4982489 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs
4982490 its fine to tell people about hope and change but you have to have plenty of concrete pragmatic ideas that bring hope and change to life
4982491 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives

4982504 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4982505 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4982506 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4982507 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4982508 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

4982531 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4982532 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4982533 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system

4982551 this had been the issue with regard to the riddle of the wedding and this is the issue regarding the riddle of samsons strength
4982552 he simply does not take it seriously like his strength and the people around him it is a toy to be played with not a calling to be fulfilled
4982553 given the character and conduct of the man the narrator probably was relieved to have samson put it this way it limited the damage he was causing for the reputation of the god of israel
4982554 the riddle in 14 18 sweetness has won over strength
4982555 overnight a man with the highest conceivable calling the divinely commissioned agent of deliverance for israel is cast down to the lowest position imaginable grinding flour for others in prison

4982557 to the man who has been placed in the center of the crowd and of the building the man who was the victim of philistine torture and the butt of philistine jokes
4982558 he killed many more when he died than while he lived

4982597 thats none of your business why do you ask such a thing
4982598 i just want to know please tell me how much do you make an hour
4982599 if the only reason you asked that is so you can borrow some money to buy a silly toy or some other nonsense then you march yourself straight to your room and go to bed think about why you are being so selfish i work hard everyday for such this childish behavior
4982600 ive been thinking maybe i was too hard on you earlier
4982601 its been a long day and i took out my aggravation on you heres the 10 you asked for

4982608 were hoping to have the building completely down by summer 2009
4982609 this is probably the safest job in the city but its also the slowest moving ive never experienced anything like this
4982610 this was a very serious outbreak and it was preventable
4982611 for a long time she thought thats how kids who do the wrong thing are punished
4982612 what made this person think they could do this especially to a child with a speech delay its like the ultimate betrayal
4982613 i just wanted an answer and i didnt get one
4982614 she used to be a lot more calm and cool more collected she used to be happy
4982615 now she whines a lot shes antsy always looking for attention or an affirmation she is such an easy kid to get along with that someone would do this is outrageous
4982616 this is part of a relentless and ongoing attack on the sons henry and matthew since theyve been appointed guardianship of his personal needs and health care
4982617 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4982618 ecstatic and couldnt keep the smiles off their faces or their eyes off each other
4982619 my mother was also against it for the obvious reasons
4982620 it was just one of those childhood dreams i never grew out of everybody was against it because nobody thinks of jewish people as police officers
4982621 i always wanted to be a cop but my wife sharona was against it
4982622 but i convinced her it took her two years she thinks its a dangerous job i was sick of my other job because there was no room to grow i wanted a future
4982623 the next class is going to have 30 or 40

4982627 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4982628 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4982629 i think the biggest thing is that nothing is impossible
4982630 so many people said it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4982631 no reasonable person would believe that the college degrees especially the bachelor of arts the bachelor of science the ph d s were legitimate
4982632 it was a grocery store of whatever you wanted you paid for it and then it came in the mail
4982633 no my desk is next to the door but that is a good point the man sitting in the cubicle next to me is under a window and his printer is working fine

4982636 aiba chan were going to see them now but you mustnt say anything to upset alys okay shes already upset over nino
4982637 dont you want to go home its not good for you to stay here if youre tired
4982638 you two should rest i know what your schedules are like
4982639 nino wouldnt want you to get sick over him ill take mama home
4982640 hes right you can come see him tomorrow its not like manager san doesnt know about you
4982641 how can anyone with such a face have the disposition he has
4982642 simultaneously sweet and cruel and i wouldnt have him any other way
4982643 she yawned and muttered in what i think was english
4982644 want me to take you home ninos fine look at him smirking in his sleep like something good had happened to him
4982645 take him home ill be here to knock sense into him when he comes to dont worry jun will come in the morning
4982646 well come back and see him tomorrow you rest too okay night
4982647 i dont know many things but i know that you cannot just do what you just did in there i know how you feel but its not right
4982648 riidas right nino needs mama more than i do ill be better tomorrow ill be good ill bring something from keikarou for mama and everyone
4982649 oh chan how long will it take for you to design a clasp for a white gold necklace that only those in the know can undo
4982650 i want you to design a clasp for a necklace i want this clasp to be special so that i can put the necklace around my alyss neck and she cant take it off unless she knows how to trigger the mechanism
4982651 she will figure out how to open it after a while
4982652 yeah i know that but it will take her a while
4982653 how long will you take you to design such a clasp
4982654 it depends on the mechanism and whether you want a design on the clasp
4982655 how about a design on the clasp that would match the design on the pendant a black pearl pendant how long would it take
4982656 two weeks if im fast a month if im slow
4982657 also drop earrings bracelet and ring all with black pearls make it part of a set
4982658 while youre at it i want it all in white gold nothing weird on the design something classy oh chan
4982659 its best that i get the designs from you first so you wouldnt complain that i keep coming back to you when i need something
4982660 concentrate first on the clasp and the pendant first if you dont want to do the rest
4982661 the necklace for this year the rest are like insurance policies the idea is to give her a piece every year that were together im not that stupid to spend that much in one go what kind of a lunatic gets more than one piece of jewellery made
4982662 didnt you hear me riida the rest are insurance policies i have everything carefully planned out theres only so much money im willing to spend on her in a year
4982663 these are for sets of earrings and rings why would you make so many designs hmm
4982664 i was bored and thought i could do better than the designs in the shop
4982665 yeah right try telling that to kaoru chan and see whether she believes you
4982666 you already have so many prelim sketches then just give me one of these designs and expand upon it with a bracelet and pendant it would save you the trouble of designing from scratch
4982667 ne isnt it cheaper to just go to a shop and buy alys something
4982668 a necklace is like a collar i want people to look at alys and think that she has a long and elegant neck a store bought one would be beautiful on her but it wouldnt have any meaning shes mine oh chan
4982669 i want the guys who look at her to know that shes mine when they see that pendant hanging from her neck i want them to know that this kakkoi woman is off limits you know what i mean dont you
4982670 but you do satoshi i do see things clearer from behind the ds and the psp
4982671 alys treats him like a kid she treats him the same way okaasan treats you and me
4982672 i know you know i know i know you know were very knowledgeable the two of us i also know that he hasnt said anything about it to her he hasnt done anything but look at her with a stupid smile like a kid looking at pudding
4982673 why else do you think i still behave normally around him i know him and how he thinks he has no intention of making a move even if that baka bought her a panda why couldnt she have told me she wanted it i would have asked the duet photo shoot idiots to give me that panda i would have gotten it for her
4982674 that panda be damned she says its cuter than me than me
4982675 the point is he bought it for her she could have asked me for it i would have gotten it for her
4982676 theres nothing to worry about we all know you love alys
4982677 does he know that that day when she visited us at fuji tv in the kimono aiba was watching her every move and he even dared to show me that disgusted face the glances he gives me when he thinks im not paying attention seem to indicate that he doesnt think i have much regard for her i do not ever want her to think like that i want alys chan to know that she is valued and rarer than a limited edition game a store bought something that someone else out there could also have isnt good enough for her
4982678 we dont talk about you know those kind of things
4982679 half the time were like whatever and we talk about ordinary stuff sometimes lots of times we dont talk shes just there doing her thing and im doing my thing its comfortable to have her around just once i want to hear her say that she needs me
4982680 shes into skinship as much as you i swear she touches you almost as much as you touch me sometimes
4982681 she kicks when she sleeps thats not the kind of skinship i want
4982682 occasionally she would flick her wrist at me and tell me to keep my hands to myself especially if shes writing a paper or reading and her temper ha where do i start she needs a lot of alone time when shes reading writing or something to do with academia what if hypothetically speaking she kicks me away one day because she thinks i dont care enough for her before that happens i should do something ne
4982683 i need at least two trial runs before the actual concert
4982684 what has all this got to do with concerts we dont tour again until next month for summer
4982685 necklace equals dry run number one earrings equal dry run number two bracelet equals actual show ring equals encore
4982686 you only see what you want to see anyway concentrate on your designs my alys chan deserves the best
4982687 do you want to stay for dinner son number two because if you are bring daughter in law number two over that girl doesnt eat enough
4982688 she has a late evening lecture she cant make it today
4982689 ill tell her to eat well i had better get going ive another shoot tonight so oh chan will do it for me
4982690 self confidence is always a good thing its good for art it breeds inspiration
4982691 moods affect art it can change your work for better or worse
4982692 you were happy because the end result represents fluidity its the same with your dance steps ne i watched the video of your dancing with okaasama the other day and i noticed that your steps reflect the mood you had when you choreographed the steps what you feel at the time gives you the inspiration to create it to begin with and thats a good thing it means you believe in yourself
4982693 what about aiba its not normal for him to pretend to be excited about everything when he says hes hurting i dont think thats good for him
4982694 once nino kun gets better and alys nee chan gets back aiba san will see that the two of them are happy he will then be happy for them because they are both friends he needs time and if he wants to talk listen it helps him if he knows theres someone to listen to him
4982695 its getting nino to talk thats a problem he talks a lot to me about everything but when it comes to you know alys he becomes all sarcastic
4982696 its like a topic in art you tell a class of students to draw a fish and everyone will draw a fish differently its exactly the same thing i dont know how nino kun and alys nee chan are together because ive not seen them together however from that which ive seen of them separately they do think of each other a lot
4982697 this baka decided that it would be hilarious to catch everyone unawares
4982698 i bring this here to commemorate the occasion of our fearless leaders closing performance and you dont even show a bit of interest in it say something funny
4982699 i brought you here to keep everyone in check and not drive manager san up the wall youre not supposed to be prodding me like your amoeba
4982700 is this one of ninos jokes for a ni no arashi thing
4982701 nino said he would be here later mamas cooking dinner for us they said we would have orange chicken russian salad dumpling soup and cake
4982702 knowing them they would janken for it and the loser pays
4982703 i paid for it mama nino and i went to the supermarket yesterday
4982704 aiba chan i hate to tell you this but youve just been swindled by the worlds stingiest couple
4982705 uwah this is classy if a little cheap paper plates
4982706 how can the worlds two evilest and most perverse people look like that in their sleep
4982707 she said that they werent interested in buying whatever we were selling
4982708 ne do you two sleeping beauties ever think about anything but money
4982709 do you guys have a death wish creeping up on us like that
4982710 aww come on guys they brought food you guys shouldnt have done that
4982711 dinner will cost you 1450 yen per head with the exception of ohno kun
4982712 well we could exclude baby chan and still make a profit
4982713 we were able to meet with the towns governor who has two members of the georgian parliament assigned to help him but there is no police force russian or georgian the arriving humanitarian help consistently reaches its recipients we were warned not to stay out during the night due to crime and theft the town square has to shell holes but the statue of stalin is there intact
4982714 if we compare data from july of 2008 with data from july of 2007 we will see that the numbers are going down
4982715 victory at the next parliamentary elections is our most important task now
4982716 why are they undertaking measures against bulgaria if they can go around our country then they do not have a problem
4982717 they are preparing the situation this clique around the bulgarian socialist party and the movement for rights and freedoms so that if something happens with me they would be able to attribute it to some conflicts in the past
4982718 it was a laugh on the yard that his wife was still a hottie
4982719 mr black had no clue of what was going on and or what to do
4982720 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4982721 i really dont know if im looking for anybody to apologize its not going to do me any good
4982722 i will be at my husbands firehouse with my family and friends and joeys friends attending the plaque dedication
4982723 i want those that are responsible for the condition of that building for the condition of what those firefighters faced to be held responsible and accountable
4982724 the office was there for eight years and i continued the lease
4982725 when i became a member i inherited an office not accessible to the handicapped or anyone with any walking disabilities even for myself it was difficult to get up the stairs
4982726 answering that question with any specificity is above my pay grade
4982727 a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis
4982728 the full circumstances of this serious incident are being investigated by a dedicated team of detectives
4982729 incidents of this nature are very rare in north wales but we are appealing to the general public to give us information to help us apprehend the people responsible for this crime as soon as possible
4982730 even love the beloved republic that feeds upon freedom and lives
4982731 the coup detat appears to have failed and admiral tomas where abouts is at present unknown
4982732 well at all events i m still here i don t like it very much but how are you

4982734 o thou who lovest me set this love in order
4982735 i feel sorry for people who dont drink they wake up in the morning and thats the best theyre going to feel all day
4982736 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement that will end this conflict
4982737 i am convinced that with the end of the cold war bloc discipline simply disappeared
4982738 it was really hard to go back into the gym after what happened but i kept training
4982739 we hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
4982740 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4982741 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4982742 i thought it was just tendons they get hypersensitive leading up to a marathon i was icing it this week it didnt affect how i was training it was a bit sore when i woke up i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon in a bus

4982790 however a jihad also has peaceful and positive meanings and it is unfortunate if the authorities repeat it and strengthen the extremists use of the word
4982791 the danish intelligence agency has introduced new guidelines for discussing terrorism advising authorities to avoid words like jihad and martyr

4982848 in the u s however entire living areas are designed so as to make it hell for pedestrians
4982849 seven american utopias combines cultural history design analysis and political theory it is thus a conceptually ambitious book and a good one a sophisticated study of the politics of design
4982850 this is a book to startle and inspire feminists today an architect herself hayden has brought history to life by insisting that social problems are also spatial problems and must be addressed as such
4982851 womens work is not done the design of our place to live some still call it the built environment still follows mens visions for most women the old household drudgeries have merely been replaced by new suburban drudgeries
4982852 we now have women architects all of 3 percent of a total of 37 000 members of the american institute of architects but few if any of them are addressing the issues of residential and community design that are still keeping women in their place and that a century and a half ago led to what dolores hayden calls material feminism
4982853 the most cynical anti planner and the scrappiest tenant organizer will be pleasantly surprised to see that hayden includes positions of class race and the economic underpinnings of womens position
4982854 essential reading for preservationists and anyone interested in urban america
4982855 hayden invents a totally original method of storytelling with the shapes of time the result is an almost poetic invocation of the resilience of the human condition grounded in both theoretical understanding and practical experiences of place making and preservation
4982856 the power of place is a graceful manifesto that enlists dolores haydens formidable skills as a writer and architectural historian to argue for new ways to understand and represent the social history of urban space

4982879 i watched the race and saw him with his mother they look like a good family
4982880 when he won his first or second medal he looked so confident
4982881 that is going to be critically important because right now there is really no data to make a scientific judgment one way or the other
4982882 the information that has been put out there is really very little scientific information in there
4982883 the case is built from a number of pieces of circumstantial evidence and for a case this important its troubling to have so many loose ends the briefing pointed out even more loose ends than i thought there were before
4982884 its very hard to get the sense of whether this was scientifically good or bad we didnt really get the question settled other than taking their word for it
4982885 spitz sure hes done well but if i was allowed to run every race forwards backwards and in a freestyle and get medals for each i could also rack up the same number of medals without too much trouble

4982891 what if we designed city life around the happiness of the people who live there instead of the ease of moving cars around for those who dont
4982892 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
4982893 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
4982894 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
4982895 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
4982896 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
4982897 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily

4982899 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4982900 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4982901 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4982902 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4982903 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4982904 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4982905 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4982906 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4982907 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4982908 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
4982909 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
4982910 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4982911 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
4982912 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
4982913 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
4982914 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
4982915 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
4982916 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
4982917 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
4982918 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
4982919 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
4982920 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
4982921 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
4982922 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
4982923 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
4982924 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
4982925 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
4982926 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
4982927 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
4982928 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile
4982929 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

4982931 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
4982932 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

4982942 statin therapy is well established for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the general population but its effectiveness in patients with kidney disease is unclear
4982943 we showed that statin therapy was indeed associated with a lower risk of death in renal transplant recipients
4982944 notwithstanding the encouraging findings of our trial it has to be acknowledged that even the most state of the art statistical techniques can adjust only for measured confounders
4982945 unmeasured confounders are not taken into account and they can be addressed only by truly randomized clinical trials
4982946 this study provides evidence that statin treatment is associated with reduced all cause mortality in renal transplant recipients however the nonrandomized nature of our trial does not provide definitive evidence as to whether the observed associations are truly causal
4982947 statin use is associated with prolonged survival of renal transplant recipients
4982948 these findings suggest that kidneys obtained from black donors after cardiac death may afford the best long term survival for black recipients
4982949 these data suggest that among black recipients transplantation with kidneys donated after cardiac death may be more beneficial than transplantation with kidneys donated after brain death
4982950 but rather view our results as additional support for the increased recovery and use of kidneys donated after cardiac death
4982951 donor ethnicity influences outcomes following deceased donor kidney transplantation in black recipients
4982952 provided appropriate selection criteria are applied with regard to fitness for surgery
4982953 there seems no justification for withholding total knee arthroplasty from patients who are obese
4982954 however it suggests that if appropriate selection criteria are applied total knee arthroplasty can be worthwhile in patients who are obese
4982955 any osteoarthritis in the controls was not sufficiently severe to have them placed on a waiting list for total knee arthroplasty the patients were considered to have advanced osteoarthritis hence the need for arthroplasty
4982956 i think a minimum of 10 years would be required to have this be a meaningful statistic
4982957 long term outcome following total knee arthroplasty a controlled longitudinal study
4982958 women in subsistence economies producing and reproducing wealth in partnership with nature have been experts in their own right of holistic and ecological knowledge of natures processes but these alternative modes of knowing which are oriented to the social benefits and sustenance needs are not recognised by the capitalist reductionist paradigm because it fails to perceive the interconnectedness of nature or the connection of womens lives work and knowledge with the creation of wealth
4982959 overall patient and graft survival in hcv positive recipients is comparable with that in hcv negative patients and there seems to be little if any adverse effect on sort and medium term follow up with the use of carefully selected older donor grafts in recipients with hcv
4982960 data from this series suggest that the continued use of selected older donors is a safe method of expanding the liver donor pool even for hcv positive recipients
4982961 it remains possible that longer follow up will demonstrate a difference in graft or patient survival
4982962 however we have not observed the accelerated graft loss due to recurrent hcv in recipients of older donor grafts that has been previously suggested leading us to believe that this practice is safe
4982963 i am not ready to accept that a general broadening to marginal donors including all older donors those with steatosis and those with longer ischemia times will continue to give equally good results for patients receiving liver transplantation for hcv
4982964 based on our data we would not say that a 65 year old or a 70 year old donor is going to be the same as a 40 year old donor with other variables and can be used equally donor age has to be considered just like other important variables
4982965 i think its a variable thats important but i think certainly based on our data we feel that in properly selected donors who otherwise appear to be suitable that donor age alone should not be an exclusion criteria even in patients who have hcv
4982966 when a child gets antibiotics appears to be one of the most critical yet most easily modifiable risk factors for preventing infection and may matter just as much as the type and dosage of the medication
4982967 the moral of this is that an ounce of timely prevention is indeed worth a pound of treatment
4982968 timing of preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis a modifiable risk factor for deep surgical site infections after pediatric spinal fusion
4982969 our feeling is that there is enough study in the area of fall prevention and now its just a matter of getting it out and getting it disseminated
4982970 our project was the first attempt to disseminate evidence regarding fall related injuries from randomized controlled trials to clinicians from multiple disciplines
4982971 first there were no other known secular trends that might explain the differences observed second the lower rates were specific to fall related use of medical services whereas rates of use for any cause increased slightly more in the intervention region than in the usual care region third the divergence in rates coincided with intervention rates

4982974 he deserves every ounce of respect and admiration and attention that he gets because what hes doing is incredibly phenomenal

4982978 i think i forced myself to get back in too early after athens

4982980 ive got my wedding come up so i want to be in good shape
4982981 it took a lot of pressure off me for the rest of the meet
4982982 i remember leaving athens i was like wow i dont remember that
4982983 i was just overwhelmed with the entire experience i think that gave me a bit of an advantage this time i did make a conscious effort to stay present in the moment

4983016 educational efforts focusing on healthy relationships should begin during childhood
4983017 further studies are needed that explore emotional violence particularly its relationship to future violence
4983018 it is unclear whether female perpetration is reflective of women initiating violence within a relationship female female violence within same gender relationships self defense or retaliation for past abuse
4983019 men may underreport victimization because of shame embarrassment and fear that their masculinity may be questioned
4983020 i was once so connected with a female human body that we shared the same blood the same oxygen the same food if it werent for that woman i would not exist look here is the evidence
4983021 the lack of superiority of combination therapy over epinephrine alone regardless of the patient subgroup suggests that it may be futile to add vasopressin to epinephrine during cardiopulmonary resuscitation with advanced cardiac life support
4983022 but it more realistically reflects the effects of cardiopulmonary resuscitation interventions because medical care in the intensive care units wards and rehabilitation facilities could not be standardized in our study protocol although differences in care may have profoundly influenced the outcomes
4983023 intimate partner violence among men prevalence chronicity and health effects
4983024 patients perceived difficulty with comprehension only 20 of the time when they demonstrated deficient comprehension
4983025 it is disturbing that so many patients do not understand their post emergency department care and that they do not even recognize where the gaps in knowledge are
4983026 patients who fail to follow discharge instructions may have a greater likelihood of complications after leaving the emergency department
4983027 patient comprehension of emergency department care and instructions are patients aware of them they do not understand
4983028 we believe our study is the first to demonstrate that patients who leave the hospital following cardiac arrest without severe neurological disabilities may expect fair long term survival and quality of life for reasonable expenses to the healthcare system
4983029 restricting the demands for futile medical services by limiting access to the icu at least for patients likely to die anyway has been proposed as a theoretical model to lower expenditures
4983030 healthcare costs long term survival and quality of life following icu admission after cardiac arrest
4983031 consider a man age 72 years and is from a highly deprived area has previous emergency admissions eight previous admissions and 106 total bed days in the previous three years and is in receipt of multiple prescriptions for different classes of drugs the absolute risk of admission in the next year is 52 8 percent
4983032 in a typical family practice with 3 000 people 40 or older a cutoff point of greater than 46 would identify 29 high risk people for potential intervention case management
4983033 six of every 10 people identified by the algorithm would have gone on to have emergency admissions without any intervention although sensitivity is low
4983034 at the other end of the spectrum a cutoff score of 23 or greater for high risk would give better sensitivity but more resources would be wasted in that only one of every five people would have gone on to be admitted this would represent about 790 people for case management
4983035 development and validation of a model for predicting emergency admissions over the next year peony
4983036 of course trauma physicians want to get the blood flowing as soon as possible and increasing the viscosity of blood may not make any sense to them
4983037 however our results are highly suggestive that increasing viscosity rather than partially restoring blood volume is a better way to increase blood flow through tissues
4983038 the idea has always been that blood is thick so the sick should be treated by bleeding in order to thin the blood
4983039 even as late as world war ii and the vietnam war it was thought that adding isotonic fluids to replace blood lost on the battlefield would be good because it lowered blood viscosity making it easier for the heart to pump
4983040 increased plasma viscosity prolongs microhemodynamic conditions during small volume resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock

4983069 i have to tell you up front both of these guys are my friends they both care deeply about america they are both patriots
4983070 they have very different ideas on how america can be strengthened
4983071 were not really sure perhaps it is in case we need to access your information
4983072 you really think that would work just because we have computers doesnt mean we know how to use them for such things what do you think theyll do fire us all and replace us all
4983073 dont you think the united states and these other big countries are just coming into sudan not because they care about the country but because theyre trying to make money and profit do you really think they help make things better or are they really just making things worse
4983074 but really your question is irrelevant we should be one african country united in our politics and goals and opinions it is because we have failed that weve had to turn to the great powers to start with and where are we to go if we go to the african union the arab sudanese will not accept any sort of ruling and will continue to repress the people with arms if we go to the arab league the african sudanese will not accept it either and will continue the armed struggle therefore since were clearly not solving the problems ourselves where else can we possibly turn to
4983075 look more closely to apples strategy before we can say more about what kind of opportunities this will bring us

4983092 it album art survived from the lp to the cd but if that becomes obsolete then i guess album art wont exist i think it would be a big loss
4983093 either we are going to decide that we dont want to go to the olympics that we are going to be non competitive that we are going to sit here and watch other countries compete or we are going to join in

4983104 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4983105 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4983106 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4983107 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4983112 you know how when a family breaks up in most instances the child stays with the mother she is the more reliable caretaker it is the same with a country i simply think that we are more reliable and we are more able to give up living a normal life in order honourably to fulfil our responsibilities
4983113 every man thinks he is more capable than any woman this is normal women dont criticise them for this in fact we support them in their sense of superiority
4983114 the president says we are addicted to oil and yet we are feeding that addiction rather than pushing for newer technologies that can wean us away from that

4983118 some people dont like to see a drilling rig operating out there but it looks great to me
4983119 because the price of crude is up the engineers and geologists have developed a backlog of potential wells to drill
4983120 these are tiny little projects inside huge companies and they dont get the attention they deserve
4983121 we look at old orphaned assets and we redevelop them
4983122 we came up with a phased approach of returning eureka to production
4983123 since it had been so long since it had been on you had to show you could still produce it and get some money flowing to pay for the other phases
4983124 we are all proud to be a part of something as special as this

4983129 theres greater police presence in some areas many of the usual suspects acknowledge that and are displaced from the area
4983130 the areas been bad for a while but within the last couple of months its gotten a lot better
4983131 activity is still going on but not like it was
4983132 at one time you couldnt walk out on the street you couldnt sit on your porch
4983133 it would be on the verge of out of control
4983134 how do you convince people that its not acceptable to tear up your own neighborhood
4983135 people who live in those neighborhoods know why the problems are there
4983136 its 2 oclock in the morning theres no reason to be standing on the corner
4983137 if you dont take care of it today eventually youre going to have to deal with it

4983143 right now eastport is one of the safest places in town
4983144 theyre there to make money if they cant make money its not good for business
4983145 weve been trying to wage a war on drugs for a long time
4983146 if theyre seeing less drug dealing then were excited about that
4983147 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4983148 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work

4983177 they do demonstrate that 10 hz stimulation induced changes can be measured in normal visual cortex
4983178 it is not possible to conclusively identify the mechanisms responsible for the sensitivity improvements that we report here
4983179 however we can assume that explanations based simply on global excitation or inhibition are unlikely to be satisfactory because both 1 hz and 10 hz stimulation were effective in the majority of subjects

4983212 i was gunna be a rockstar but work got in the way
4983213 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4983214 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4983215 but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january
4983216 we came out on offense and executed and threw and caught the ball and the offensive line did an excellent job of run blocking
4983217 michael smith and dennis johnson made big runs defensively we created some turnovers among the takeaways was an interception return for a touchdown by ford against the second offense and an interception by cornerback ramon broadway in the end zone against dick
4983218 we made a lot of big plays a lot of big runs a lot of big throws
4983219 everybody was on the same page dick was gunning for a fifth touchdown pass when he was picked off on a fade route by broadway who leads the team in camp interceptions
4983220 he did throw the one pick in the end zone but what i liked is he came back later in the scrimmage called the exact same play and threw it for a touchdown
4983221 we came out and played hard we just got off to a slow start again
4983222 hes got a knack for rushing the passer robinsons linemates were happy to see him
4983223 they came in on him at the last minute and offered him second round money
4983224 zack held true to everything he told us all year long and thats rare these days
4983225 did you take a left turn get lost and end up here it was explained we were on an sec road trip and he immediately wanted to know where all we had been he shook his head when we told him we had driven almost 2 200 miles in five days
4983226 if you arent having fun it is your own fault during the course of the interview he was asked if he thought as defending national champions the tigers should have been the preseason no 1

4983240 will not compete for the razorbacks in the 2008 2009 basketball season
4983241 i violated ncaa rules and what happened went over the coaches heads
4983242 a lot of people thought it was because of grades but i go to class every day
4983243 im going overseas for a year and hopefully ill be able to come back and get picked in the draft
4983244 this was hard because i was working out with the team at arkansas every day and getting ready for the season
4983245 its going pretty good for the first day in pads
4983246 im excited and everything and glad to get the whole recruiting process done with bailey and his family took an unofficial visit to arkansas on aug 1 and he said that pretty much solidified the choice for him and removed any doubts
4983247 the environment over there wasnt like the rest of them
4983248 it was different the rest of them felt the same but not long after i got there i knew it was the place for me bailey is also complimentary of mcgee and how he handled the recruiting process
4983249 him and my dad have become really good friends throughout the entire process
4983250 we have talked a lot lately bailey said he feels with his recruiting decision out of the way he can now concentrate on helping broken arrow succeed this fall
4983251 i think we have a chance to be really good if we keep working hard
4983252 i have quick feet im pretty athletic and im quick off the ball
4983253 thats a pretty good combination baileys father alvin played basketball at arkansas and lettered for the 1979 team out of helena west helena central bailey said even though his father was a razorback he didnt force arkansas on him
4983254 he told me it was a good school and everything but throughout the whole process he wasnt wanting me to go there really bad or anything
4983255 he just basically told me it was my decision when i did make the decision he was pretty excited as well as was my whole family prior to fridays practice in pads the tigers had three days of practicing in shorts
4983256 i think they are focusing too much on who left and a new system
4983257 i dont think its going to be a big deal really bailey said his final decision came down to arkansas and oklahoma after also getting offers from kansas kansas state michigan state iowa state and nebraska

4983265 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
4983266 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their election day all in an almost 10 week period
4983267 there are ups and downs with a slight advantage to obama
4983268 if anybody had asked us a couple of months ago whether or not we would like to be where we are today which from what we can tell is a pretty even race we would have been pretty thrilled
4983269 this risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture is further increased in those over age 60 in kidney heart and lung transplant recipients and with use of concomitant steroid therapy
4983270 physicians should advise patients at the first sign of tendon pain swelling or inflammation to stop taking the fluoroquinolone to avoid exercise and use of the affected area and to promptly contact their doctor about changing to a non fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug selection of a fluoroquinolone for the treatment or prevention of an infection should be limited to those conditions that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by bacteria
4983271 the next generation srx is the result of the continued exploration and refining of cadillac design language with the goal of creating dramatic presence in the luxury crossover space
4983272 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with atodays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
4983273 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
4983274 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
4983275 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
4983276 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
4983277 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
4983278 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
4983279 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

4983305 gay misses 100 meter finals after sailing through the prelims and the quarterfinals disaster struck tyson gay when he finished fifth in his semifinal heat and did not advance to the finals
4983306 toward the finish line i couldnt tell if i made it to the finals or not
4983307 ben has gotten better hes shown a lot of improvement in the passing game
4983308 ive been happy with the way hes been catching the ball catching the ball in traffic
4983309 his routes have really improved he now has to make strides in the running game being a reliable blocker
4983310 its always better to be out here competing with the guys trying to fight for a job instead of sitting on the sidelines
4983311 as a player you want to be on the field and if youre not thats depressing
4983312 thats all you want to do is go make plays and i wasnt able to do that in the spring
4983313 im getting a lot of reps at a fast pace and a key is being mentally tough enough to think while im tired
4983314 when you get your chance you need to make plays
4983315 coach petrino likes to get the ball to people that can make plays and thats what im trying to do
4983316 it was rough in the summer i didnt like coach veltkamp for a little while
4983317 but now i just give him thanks for all that hes done pushing me through those workouts and not letting me sit out
4983318 he helped get me mentally tougher so i could fight through some pain
4983319 we have sets where were out there with three tight ends at one time
4983320 weve got to have three somewhat big tight ends who can play at this level so its definitely important for ben to be healthy
4983321 he knows hes going to be a big part of our offense and hes getting ready for it
4983322 sometimes youd walk off after practice and really think about if you still wanted to be here
4983323 but ive waited through a lot of things and god just told me to be patient be patient and your time is coming
4983324 but its similar to a strong safety the usual descriptions from past regimes and i am playing the jack position
4983325 the tight safety just goes to the tight end side all the time and really the strong safety did too
4983326 we had some great examples of film where he was a blitzer and up inside the line and the ball is being thrown and weve lost force and the next thing you know he is in on the equation
4983327 hes a factor on the play even though the ball has broken outside
4983328 as a tight safety he is starting to do a lot better and understand things
4983329 my role this year is to step up and be a leader
4983330 show the younger guys as well as some of the other guys how to do it
4983331 as a team the hogs arent picked to do much
4983332 i just look at it that weve got to work harder
4983333 they offered but coach nutt and the recruiters he brought in really caught my eye
4983334 the main thing i wanted was to play in the sec
4983335 and decori of course had an influence on me as someone i knew and was familiar with
4983336 i violated ncaa rules and what happened went over the coaches heads
4983337 the university of arkansas including its administrators and coaches will have no further comment
4983338 im going overseas for a year and hopefully ill be able to come back and get picked in the draft
4983339 this was hard because i was working out with the team every day and getting ready for the season
4983340 this state is on fire for football like it hasnt been in a long time
4983341 i didnt know if i was going to be first in line or last
4983342 hes been wanting to go to a practice but its been too hot to go to a practice
4983343 i knew this was going to be inside so i thought he would be a little more active with the players
4983344 i can remember hanging out outside the stadium when the games were over and when youre at that age you really dont know who the players are
4983345 but the big guys would walk by and you would just assume they were players
4983346 we still need a little more pass rush and still need to get everyone to the football better
4983347 he blocked a punt and picked that up for a touchdown
4983348 any time the coach calls you out you really want to show them different
4983349 but what i liked is he came back later in the scrimmage called the exact same play and threw it for a touchdown
4983350 nathan moved the team and then tyler got in shotgun and threw the ball all over the place
4983351 without god and the future life how will man be after that it means everything is permitted now

4983354 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site
4983355 i have placed 3 quarks daily at the head of my list of web bookmarks
4983356 just wanted you to know im one of many who reads and enjoys 3 quarks almost daily
4983357 im so sorry but we have to talk were at the pulp chamber right now and you are going to need a root canal
4983358 for we know that god causes everything to work together for the good of those who love god and are called according to his purpose for them

4983361 a person was killed in the city of fond verettes and another was missing in the southern part of the country where local authorities have begun evacuating areas at risk
4983362 they develop in pale sun exposed skin are related to degree of exposure and latitude are fewer with avoidance and protection are readily produced experimentally and are the overwhelmingly predominant tumor in xeroderma pigmentosum where dna repair of ultraviolet light damage is impaired
4983363 its obvious that sunlight is far from the whole story with melanoma but i think it is indisputable that it is part of the story
4983364 there is no evidence for this and it is unlikely that any will be found because sunburn occurs in sun exposed sites and these are not the sites at which melanomas occur
4983365 these are areas that you would likely sunburn on your vacation versus say your arms and your hands which get everyday exposure
4983366 nobody wants to lose an eyelid or a piece of his nose
4983367 the preponderance of evidence suggests a causal relationship between ultraviolet exposure and malignant melanoma but not in an obvious and direct fashion
4983368 baby boomers were a sun worshiping generation far more than their depression era parents
4983369 its clearly multi factorial there has got to be a genetic component
4983370 i am obsessed with margo morrisons jewelry i wear it everyday her pieces can make any outfit from jeans and a t shirt to a red carpet ensemble
4983371 i feel a little tired not because of the climb but because of the heat and humidity

4983379 we clearly still need to do better and clinical trials must continue
4983380 are not so final yet 3 8 years median follow up is too short for final conclusions especially about the n1 population of patients

4983383 while men also reported some of these same tattoo problems leading to removal there seemed to be more societal fallout for women with tattoos as the tattoos began to cause embarrassment negative comments and clothes problems and no longer satisfied the need for uniqueness
4983384 women may still want to choose self controlled body site placement even in our contemporary society
4983385 while the tattoos were acquired for internal expectations of self identity at an early age
4983386 tattoo removal also seemed to be internally motivated to dissociate from the past and to improve self identity
4983387 strong tattoo support from their significant others and friends was counterbalanced by negative remarks about the tattoos from their fathers physicians and the public
4983388 it is evident then that negative societal connotations still exist for women with tattoos
4983389 that cat exposure may be a surrogate marker for other unknown environmental influences penetrating the imperfect skin barrier because of defective profilaggrin synthesis
4983390 early detection of melanoma has dramatic potential to save lives because of the exceptionally good outcome for thin melanomas and poor prognosis for advanced melanomas
4983391 we have shown a direct benefit to carriers of the cdkn2a p16 mutation and a lack of significant risk to any of the groups tested
4983392 cdkn2a p16 genetic test reporting improves early detection intentions and practices in high risk melanoma families

4983434 no all four rounds he didnt do what we were telling him

4983436 in that last round i went in there with my hands up i know i hit him with a straight left he caught me with the hook ill give them that but i think i caught him with two more punches and should have won the fight 8 7
4983437 we wanted him to box but the main thing we wanted him to do was get up early get ahead first we knew he had faster hands and more power so we wanted him to engage and make the guy have to come to him
4983438 instead they started playing the waiting game from the beginning we yelled at him talked to him between rounds but he basically did the opposite of what we asked him to do
4983439 one of the things we know is that these kids have been calling home so often
4983440 what happens is they get instructions all the way from the united states you can tell the difference because once the bell rings they start doing what their other coaches tell them
4983441 they were trying to tell me to just go at him go at him
4983442 im not that type of fighter to go out there and throw punches if i do that im going to get caught with shots i want to go out there and play it smart
4983443 luis was actually a very aggressive boxer until tonight one of the things thats always helped luis is his aggression but for some reason tonight he decided to stand back and wait and it cost him

4983691 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4983692 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4983693 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4983694 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

4983710 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4983711 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4983712 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4983713 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4983714 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4983715 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4983716 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4983717 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4983718 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4983719 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4983720 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4983721 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4983722 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4983723 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4983724 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4983725 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4983726 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

4983758 unlike you maryse i have at least accomplished something that you have not and likely never will i beat melina to become the womens champion what have you done you couldnt even win the diva search
4983759 candice was boasting earlier how she should have been the head of household maryse just smiled at her
4983760 i chose to put candice and finlay up for eviction a decision that was not an easy one but behaviour as well as maturity levels factored in my decision good luck in the power of vito ceremony

4983766 we are excited for him and have confidence in his ability to perform well at the olympic games
4983767 im trying to hold it together what an immense achievement
4983768 my philosophy is i would trade anything for an olympic medal so it means a lot
4983769 two years ago wendy was a dentist and rebecca was a rower and now theyre olympic champion and olympic silver medalist
4983770 to get them both into the olympic final i couldnt be more proud
4983771 i was never any good at any sports i dont think im even that good at riding a bike ive done what ive done through hard work
4983772 i think weve got a great model a great system weve got athletes whove got a great camaraderie no one wants to be the failure weve got the best of everything and thats why it works

4983777 in chinese to yell defense or charge sounds silly but i want to invent some catchy chinese slogans for future games

4983786 hoy chile est conforme con su statu quo territorial y no tiene reclamaciones pendientes con sus vecinos por lo tanto su gran objetivo no es ofensivo sino defensivo para materializar su defensa ha escogido una estrategia disuasiva
4983787 no ha incrementado su gasto en defensa sino que lo mantiene constante y eso es bueno porque quiere decir que no est en una carrera armamentista

4983816 we know he can score those type of goals but the rest of the team still needs to play well and keep a clean sheet
4983817 we dropped off torres 25 yards from goal and he pulled the trigger thats why he cost a few bob and thats the beauty of the premier league
4983818 we tired and that probably affected our decision making until then we had defended very well but a lot of teams do score late in the premier league
4983819 i was really pleased with the performance though i think we played some good stuff and created one or two good chances but when you play the big boys youve got to take those chances it would have been very hard for liverpool if we had gone in front
4983820 im encouraged by the performance when we played teams like liverpool last season i hoped we would get a good result this morning i thought we would get a good result liverpool will be delighted to see the back of us and thats a decent sign for us
4983821 most studies have reported an increased risk for migraine with aura among carriers of the tt variant
4983822 these results establish a strong mechanistic link among early nicotine exposure common haplotypes and adult nicotine addiction in three independent populations of european origins
4983823 the identification of an age dependent susceptibility haplotype reinforces the importance of preventing early exposure to tobacco through public health policies
4983824 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes are likely candidates for harboring functional variants contributing to nicotine addiction since these ligand gated ion channels are the initial physiological targets of nicotine in the central and peripheral nervous system
4983825 because disease risk from the adverse health effects of tobacco smoke is related to lifetime tobacco exposure the finding that an age dependent effect of these haplotypes has a strong influence on lifetime smoking behavior reinforces the public health significance of delaying smoking onset
4983826 a candidate gene approach identifies the chrna5 a3 b4 region as a risk factor for age dependent nicotine addiction
4983827 breast cancer arising in young women is a unique disease entity driven by complex biologic processes extending beyond hormone receptors and hereditary cancer syndromes
4983828 represents a new diagnostic approach that may bring us closer to an era of individualized medicine
4983829 we speculate that this molecular marker may be a way of distinguishing patients who are likely to have a prolonged response to erlotinib or gefitinib from those whose response is short lived
4983830 and who may be appropriate candidates for second generation irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors or combination targeted therapy regimens
4983831 detection of mutations in egfr in circulating lung cancer cells
4983832 applying family history related criteria in an unselected population could result in the screening of many women who will not develop breast cancer at an early age
4983833 if the model would be used in clinical decision settings it would be an easy to use method to reassure a large number of women regarding their personal breast cancer risk at an early age and their need to be referred to early screening programs or genetic centers
4983834 a family history of breast cancer will not predict female early onset breast cancer in a population based setting
4983835 may point the way towards underlying pathogenic pathways in the disease furthermore high resolution scans for copy number variants may well identify more copy number variations associated with the disease and given the high odds ratio these are likely to be clinically useful in diagnosis and risk assessment
4983836 only account for a very small fraction of the genetic risk of schizophrenia
4983837 an exciting step towards what promises to be a fruitful field for further investigation
4983838 we can therefore now posit that some cases of schizophrenia are genomic disorders although we do not yet know whether the risk is specific for schizophrenia as opposed to a more general risk factor for neuropsychiatric or central nervous system illness
4983839 exactly how a subtle 1 15 fold increase in copy number variation burden translates mechanistically into illness in a given patient is currently unknown

4983841 the negative outcome of this trial suggests that simvastatin should not be prescribed to ameliorate the cognitive deficits associated with neurofibromatosis type 1
4983842 whether the observed improvement in object assembly is a real effect and whether simvastatin would improve academic achievement remain to be confirmed
4983843 genotyping of sclo1b1 polymorphisms may be useful in the future for tailoring both the statin dose and safety monitoring
4983844 the study by the search collaborative group shows an unequivocal association
4983845 since approximately 60 of the cases of simvastatin induced myopathy were attributed to variant sclo1b1 avoiding the administration of high dose simvastatin to those who are homozygous or heterozygous for the variant allele could reduce the incidence of myopathy by nearly 60

4983897 were beginning to see that epigenetics stands at the center of modern medicine because epigenetic changes unlike dna sequence which is the same in every cell can occur as a result of dietary and other environmental exposure
4983898 epigenetics might very well play a role in diseases like diabetes autism and cancer
4983899 what we saw was a detectable change over time which showed us proof of the principle that an individuals epigenetics does change with age
4983900 what we still didnt know was why or how but we thought maybe this too is something thats heritable and could explain why certain families are more susceptible to certain diseases
4983901 these data support the idea of age related loss of normal epigenetic patterns as a mechanism for late onset of common human diseases common disease genetic and epigenetic model which could arise through the loss of functionally important epigenetic modifications as well as through the release of epigenetic buffering of intrinsic genetic variation

4983906 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico

4983908 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas

4984003 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

4984007 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4984008 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4984009 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4984010 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4984011 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4984012 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4984013 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4984014 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4984015 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4984016 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4984017 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4984018 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4984019 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4984020 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4984029 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4984030 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4984031 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4984032 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4984033 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4984034 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4984039 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4984040 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4984041 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4984042 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4984043 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4984044 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4984045 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4984046 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4984047 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4984048 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

4984050 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4984051 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4984052 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4984053 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4984054 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4984055 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4984056 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

4984067 he has destroyed the economy nationalized the only industries that were functional and created shortages of pretty much everything imported from outside the country
4984068 fueled by high oil prices record government spending helped to boost gdp in 2006 by about 9 and in 2007 by about 8
4984069 this spending combined with recent minimum wage hikes and improved access to domestic credit has created a consumption boom but has come at the cost of higher inflation roughly 20 percent in 2007 imports also have jumped significantly

4984073 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
4984074 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
4984075 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule

4984078 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4984079 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4984080 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4984081 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4984082 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4984083 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4984084 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4984085 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4984086 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4984087 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4984088 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4984089 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4984090 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4984098 o governo foi a voz das grandes corpora es mas n o dos pequenos empres rios
4984099 de longe a quest o mais importante tendo sido citada por 60 das pessoas entrevistadas apenas 20 dos entrevistados citaram o iraque como sua preocupa o principal ficando em segundo na lista de prioridades dos eleitores
4984100 os eleitores n o gostam de pr ticas desonestas por parte de l deres corporativos mas populismo econ mico tamb m n o funciona
4984101 ambos os candidatos representam uma inc gnita ao mundo dos neg cios
4984102 eles t m que se mostrar atentos e respons veis para com as pol ticas econ micas e serem capazes de lidar com o empresariado e tratar de neg cios
4984103 john fala aos grandes empres rios e se preocupa com eles mas sua grande afinidade com os pequenos empres rios respons veis por 70 dos empregos nos eua
4984104 sua vis o da pol tica econ mica est inteiramente focada na gera o de empregos e no pequeno empresariado
4984105 faz um ano e meio que tenho recebido liga es dizendo me conte sobre ele
4984106 admirava john mccain h muito tempo e disse a ele que ficaria muito feliz em ajud lo
4984107 contei a ele tenho boas not cias para voc john
4984108 o estilo de mccain n o deixa as grandes corpora es vontade mas elas o apoiar o na elei o por suas pol ticas conservadoras e a favor do livre mercado
4984109 os pequenos empres rios gostam dele por sua pol tica econ mica e personalidade
4984110 naquele recinto estava a base do eleitorado de john mccain
4984111 nunca comandei uma pequena empresa em dificuldade a n o ser que considerem minha campanha presidencial no ano passado
4984112 n o desacreditar o governo mas torn lo melhor n o ridiculariz lo mas restaurar o seu bom nome
4984113 quando ele diz algo n o da boca para fora
4984114 barack atraiu os l deres jovens e promissores de grandes empresas e os envolvidos com private equity
4984115 muitos deles tamb m tinham interesse em pol ticas econ micas n o havia tantos cabelos grisalhos sentados mesa e por isso sobrou espa o para os mais jovens
4984116 se convenceu de que ele era um candidato que gostaria de apoiar
4984117 ele tinha uma vis o incrivelmente clara e cuidadosa sobre o que o pa s precisava fazer
4984118 ele transmite a id ia da mudan a de gera es
4984119 e ningu m se envolveu com a inova o tecnol gica e a nova arrecada o de fundos como obama ent o para esse setor isso uma mensagem
4984120 ele mais ouviu do que falou o que sempre uma boa coisa
4984121 ele claramente se considera algu m capaz de sintetizar as id ias dos outros acho que isso uma habilidade importante em um presidente
4984122 n o acredito que o senador obama tenha uma programa para os grandes neg cios
4984123 ele est tentando agir na economia como um todo e precisa encontrar uma maneira de ajudar as pessoas em situa o pior n o acredito que ele perca seu sono se preocupando com pol ticas que beneficiem os grandes neg cios nem deveria e digo isso como ex secret rio de com rcio
4984124 mas em assuntos importantes que determinar o a prosperidade dos eua e a melhoria das condi es de vida dos trabalhadores estou com ele

4984139 medicaid was billed for disproportionately more stays principally for asthma 30 2 of stays for asthma versus 19 5 of all stays while medicare was billed with greater frequency when asthma was listed as a secondary diagnosis 47 4 of secondary cases of asthma compared to 37 2 of all stays
4984140 for patients whose asthma is not well controlled on moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids additional salmeterol can give symptomatic benefit
4984141 but this may be at the expense of an increased risk of serious adverse events and asthma related mortality
4984142 the rarity of mortality and serious adverse events means that there is still considerable uncertainty in relation to the size of the effects being investigated
4984143 so it cannot be concluded that the inhaled corticosteroids abolish the risks of regular salmeterol
4984144 regular salmeterol should be discontinued if no symptomatic benefit is achieved and the manufacturers advice not to increase the dose of salmeterol during exacerbations should be made clear
4984145 salmeterol should not be used as a substitute for inhaled corticosteroids and adherence with inhaled steroids should be kept under review if separate inhalers are used
4984146 regular treatment with salmeterol for chronic asthma serious adverse events

4984148 despite the clear benefit of a low sodium diet on cardiovascular risk factors
4984149 there is no therapeutic benefit in the use of a low sodium diet based on a dietary information sheet on asthma control in our study population
4984150 this is probably due to the fact that the participants already had a relatively low baseline sodium intake
4984151 and we consider that this is not likely to be clinically important at the level of the individual patient relative to the benefits that can be derived from other interventions
4984152 does a low sodium diet improve asthma control a randomized controlled trial
4984153 maternal diet during pregnancy was strongly associated with the childs diet
4984154 however the observed associations between maternal diet during pregnancy and childhood asthma outcomes were independent from the childs diet including the childs diet did not change the results
4984155 the findings of this study need to be replicated by other studies before influencing dietary advice given to pregnant women
4984156 maternal food consumption during pregnancy and the longitudinal development of childhood asthma
4984157 substantial numbers of adverse health effects likely were avoided by timely evacuation orders school closures health communications and other measures implemented by local authorities
4984158 local state and federal public health personnel should continue collaborative efforts to expand and monitor automated surveillance systems so that timely information is available during emergencies
4984159 asthma medications can have serious albeit infrequent side effects and while under treatment is undeniably a big problem not stepping down treatment when a child is doing well may be too
4984160 past research shows that when parents are concerned about side effects and their child is doing well they may take action without a doctors approval
4984161 the area has an ice base and the snow sometimes isnt stable
4984162 id say hes been there it the snow and ice has rolled and hes gone
4984163 it was a particularly good day up here this is just bad luck i presume
4984164 if i was doing this alone i would bring it in next year
4984165 if the ecb do not get this programme in place by 2010 they have missed the boat that is the latest they can possibly be
4984166 i think the county format gives you the best structure
4984167 it has been there a long time it works it is the basis it the new league builds from now it is a question whether you build on that county structure and take that into a city structure which may be on some peoples minds from a commercial aspect you might have say kent v liverpool or something like that and maybe create more rivalry
4984168 absolutely that brings the crowds in that makes it international brings television revenue in i think that is a given
4984169 english cricket sometimes works slower than the rest of the modern sports world does but sometimes that is good as long as you dont move too slow
4984170 with the right money organisation and goals in place it can be an olympic sport within a 10 year span
4984171 we want to be the dominant team sport in the world we want to bring it to the u s take it into markets where it hasnt been before and take it back into markets like the uk it is now in the modern era
4984172 when you buy high and sell low it is very hard to make money even if you do it with great enthusiasm
4984173 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4984174 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4984175 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4984187 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
4984188 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4984189 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4984190 we have no guarantee that the russians will keep to their agreement
4984191 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4984192 it is difficult to make out from the video footages about his bowling
4984193 you have to take chances against him in the sense you got to make sure when he bowls a loose delivery you get the most out of it so that you can put pressure on the bowler of course inputs from sehwag and gambhir they would really help
4984194 in any form of cricket whether in test cricket or one dayers the start is very important
4984195 of course it is crucial he is in very good nick he and gautam gambhir have played well in the test series also of course they will have some added responsibility but no real pressure
4984196 its a first game of the season and we had a physical match on the wednesday night and i was a little bit worried before that we would not be very sharp but we started well and were in control and we just couldnt finish them off
4984197 you have that old story that you feel you probably deserved to be punished in the end but i am pleased we did not let in a goal
4984198 when everybody is here we can create more clear cut chances because today the final ball was not good enough
4984199 but overall it has been a good week for us
4984200 is a trophy to finish 12 and win the carling cup not for me
4984201 but you have no quality and are not there at the end of the championship
4984202 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title
4984203 if you dont win it of course you are frustrated
4984204 after you can say it is not good enough to win it okay but you have to accept levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and in the end two or three points is not a big gap
4984205 we were very close to doing it last season and were the most unlucky team with so many bad injuries
4984206 we finished with 83 points last season lost only three games and we have stability in our club which allows us to feel we will be better this year
4984207 i know we are not making the headlines with big names but what is important is what we produce on the pitch
4984208 nasri has shown that he is an intelligent player with a good technique who can integrate well with the rest of the team
4984209 he has shown also that he can add goals to his game which is what he started to do last season
4984210 we could have had a good hiding and after four minutes that was always going to be a possibility
4984211 but we worked very hard all over the pitch and as the game wore on we started posing a real threat and looked as if we could have scored a goal
4984212 if the goalkeeper hadnt pulled off some good saves and for a clearance off the line we might have been sitting here at 1 1
4984213 there are positives although we dont take much solace out of losing
4984214 but we came with a game plan trying to counter their slick passing play and although they created chances so did we

4984233 we need to be very consistent after the world cup we lacked a bit of consistency probably lack of form and a few personal changes but no excuses
4984234 we didnt consistently maintain our standards in the asia cup we managed to turn things around we were very consistent with the bat ball and in the field thats the toughest thing for most of the international teams to consistently be in that competitive level we need to do the hard work that we have done
4984235 they have got lot of talent and they play a different game as a team they have their strengths and weakness thats the area that we need to focus and execute our game plan
4984236 its a combined effort ajantha is just a trump card we have an attacking option but there are so many others as well
4984237 if you take generally batting plays a big role whether you are batting first or chasing bowling is a factor as well but in odi cricket in general putting runs on the board is crucial
4984238 but having a bowling attack that picks up wickets you can fall back on that but not everyday we need to be very consistent
4984239 sanath is in form its a great thing not only with the bat even with the ball he can contribute the starts that he gets makes a huge different if he stays for 10 15 overs its likely we get a good start hes like virender sehwag for india that gives a different dimension for our set up
4984240 we had a look at the wicket we need to have a chat and speak to the selectors and finalise the team this is the first we practiced here in a while
4984241 the wicket seems to have a bit on in as well for both seamers and spinners and that could be a contributing factor for low scores having looked at the wicket it looks good fresh hard wicket

4984248 the adverse outcomes of assisted fertilization that we noted compared with those in the general population could therefore be attributable to the factors leading to infertility rather than to factors related to reproductive technology
4984249 the key factor about perinatal health is presence or absence of infertility
4984250 nevertheless we have to be aware that serious iatrogenic health consequences of assisted reproduction exist as long as the multiple delivery rates are 23 in europe

4984264 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4984265 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4984266 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4984267 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

4984272 hip bone density predicts breast cancer risk independently of gail score results from the womens health initiative
4984273 the critical issue in the development of diabetes mellitus is total caloric intake and subsequent weight gain rather than individual macronutrient composition although the studies indicate that modification of specific macronutrients might make it easier to decrease total calories
4984274 to some extent then soft drink consumption was correlated with unhealthy behaviors and fruit drink consumption with healthy behaviors
4984275 many of those at risk for diabetes mellitus in the group would have already developed hyperglycemia and have been excluded from the study
4984276 a level associated with a high incidence of abnormal glucose tolerance
4984277 not really a study of primary prevention of diabetes mellitus in healthy women via reduction of fat intake
4984278 reduction in diabetes risk appear ed to be related to weight loss rather than to the macronutrient composition of the diet
4984279 excess intake of sweetened drinks seems to make it easier to consume too many calories chronically
4984280 but until we have more information we have to assume that calories trump everything else and that our number one goal for the reduction of new cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus should be to reduce the intake of high energy low benefit foods

4984289 a substantial proportion of their borrowing costs come down when the rba takes the decision to move rates down

4984296 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4984297 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4984298 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4984299 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4984300 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4984301 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4984302 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4984303 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4984304 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4984305 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4984306 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4984307 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4984308 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4984309 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4984310 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4984311 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4984312 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4984313 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4984314 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4984315 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4984316 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4984317 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4984318 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4984319 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4984320 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4984321 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4984322 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4984323 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4984324 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4984325 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4984326 the independence venue has been changed to a secret site it will not be held in public as it was in recent years
4984327 it has been changed in order to not cause disruption in the traffic and peoples movement
4984328 the independence anniversary comes at time that the country is actually under foreign invasion by the armies of britain and america among 40 other infidel countries
4984329 yes dan radcliffe does have dyspraxia this is something he has never hidden thankfully his condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoelaces and bad handwriting
4984330 you were a timorous little soul when you came here
4984331 im a big fan of the whole harry potter series and i am surprised daniel radcliffe suffers from dyspraxia
4984332 he clearly suffers from a mild form but the fact he shows no sign of it at all is a great tribute to his acting skills and makes him a role model for other people with this condition
4984333 im gonna spit in their assholes and youre gonna fist em
4984334 as i stand before this microphone i am reminded that every time i have returned home from conference so many people have said president sloan we heard your voice over the radio in our mission today thousands and thousands of people are listening to the services of this great conference and as i have pleaded with my people in the years that have passed so i plead today with you following the president of this church to those who may be in alaska who know my voice keep your eyes on the president of this church and you will never go astray god bless this work
4984335 our primary is doing fine i have been able to work in some more teachers and they seem to like it almost as well as i do one lady who is teaching the boys is a non member but she certainly loves the work with all her heart she has about twenty boys in her class it is just wonderful to walk into the church on saturday afternoon and see the many beautiful faces that are waiting to greet us the saints of this branch are proud of them and they allo take active parts in the programs our sunday school is doing well also and so is the relief society
4984336 last sunday we visited the empire branch the attendance at their sunday school and meeting was large a number of those present were non members the sisters of that branch expressed the desire to have a relief society organized at a cottage meeting we held monday night elder taylor spoke on the book of mormon after meeting we sold one to an influential business man and another man asked for a copy of the sacred record thursday evening we held another meeting and at its close a young married couple applied for baptism elder taylor performed the ordinance the next morning
4984337 about a month ago she sister tsune nachie came to see us and said she felt as though she would enjoy living with a japanese hawaiian sister in honolulu arrangements were made in accord with her expressed desire and at the present time she appears to be very happy because of her new opportunity to meet the japanese people and to preach the word of the lord to them sister nachie desires that i convey to those of her missionary sons who still remain and remember her a tender greeting of good will and best wishes
4984338 for two years i have tried to live as near a perfect life as i could and during this time i have studied and prayed that i might have the true religion revealed unto me in answer to my prayers i have been guided into the acceptance of the church of jesus christ of latter day saints i know it is true
4984339 i know this is true church i want elders to come here to stay so they can pray for us so things will be better for us
4984340 we gave the child a blessing and with tear dimmed eyes the mother thanked us for calling late that night the child walked out into the furthest room of the house and joyfully exclaimed i can see you now mamma before she couldnt recognize her parent across the room her eyes were examined the following week and they were found to be normal
4984341 we were returning from our usual sunday meeting it was late at night and we were about sixteen miles from home when the car stopped after trying unsuccessfully to remedy the trouble we were chilled through as there was a strong wind blowing and the thermometer registered about fifteen degrees below zero we offered prayer and went to the nearest farm house we told them our trouble and without any questions they invited us in we talked while we were warming up and afterward we were given the best bed they had and breakfast the following morning they also went and brought us our car for their kindness they would accept nothing but a few tracts and a book of mormon giving us an invitation to return next time we came that way
4984342 i am now experiencing the happiest days of my life
4984343 fought a good fight finished their course and kept the faith
4984344 non piangere se un amico ti ha lasciato solo quando ti avr dimenticato potrai dire di averlo perso x sempre
4984345 we expect the process to move consistent with the july 18 2005 understanding and any change in their nsg position is problematic
4984346 e pi bella la medaglia di bronzo che quella dargento vinta in questo modo e con la russia uno degli avversari pi temibili
4984347 avevamo paura ma abbiamo reagito bene pastore ha tirato da gran fenomeno
4984348 e stato bello oggi avremmo potuto vincere loro ma abbiamo avuto un po di sfortuna ci siamo giocati il bronzo in modo eccelso
4984349 ci voleva perch tanto tempo che aspettavamo questo momento con la russia abbiamo dimostrato un grandissimo carattere
4984350 siamo contenti per il bronzo ma oggi era la volta buona per vincere loro peccato per la seminfinale
4984351 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4984352 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4984353 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4984354 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4984355 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4984356 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4984357 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4984358 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4984359 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4984360 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4984361 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4984362 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4984363 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4984364 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4984365 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4984366 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4984367 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4984368 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4984369 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4984370 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4984371 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4984372 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4984373 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4984374 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4984375 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4984376 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4984377 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4984378 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4984379 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4984380 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4984381 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4984382 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4984383 who are open to doing something on the production side
4984384 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4984385 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4984386 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4984387 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4984388 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4984389 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4984390 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4984391 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4984392 were hate to inconvenience those visitors that had plans to be in the keys the next few days but their well being is our top priority
4984393 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4984394 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4984395 die schie ereien an schulen fingen erst an als die schulen von der regierung zu waffenfreien zonen erkl rt wurden aber warum sollte man es zulassen dass es leute dort drau en gibt die sich nicht verteidigen k nnen
4984396 das ist doch als befehle man einem hund fass sie
4984397 when you are nervous about everything else you put your money in a toll road
4984398 thats the logic of infrastructure returns are stable and predictable you wont get fabulously rich but youll get stable cash flow
4984399 were just looking at ways to be more efficient and thats why i used the term public private partnerships trying to find some creative solutions
4984400 the reason im avoiding taxes is because i think taxes are addictive
4984401 economic conditions are tough and are going to be very harsh on the performance of state budgets in 2008 and 2009
4984402 states are looking for long term solutions in running businesses a public private partnership is a tool in their toolboxes
4984403 were very committed to this space our business activity has increased dramatically even this year
4984404 the argument for a public private partnership is the private sector is a lot smarter about paying attention to costs and because it has skin in the game will be more attentive to maintaining an asset over its life
4984405 elected officials often shortchange funding of maintenance because they dont want to increase user fees or taxes to pay for it
4984406 their election cycle is four years they can pass it on to someone elses watch
4984407 lotteries have infrastructure characteristics in that they have stable cash flows and high barriers to entry
4984408 they could even attract private equity investment because they are self financeable and require minimal capital expenses
4984409 lower and more predictable landing fees and terminal rentals for airlines which certainly arent flush
4984410 vim a pequim para ganhar alguma medalha e se eu perdesse a final eu tamb m ficaria contente mas como ganhei a de ouro claro que fico mais feliz
4984411 estou contente por mim e pela espanha e esta medalha para todos que me ap iam l e tamb m para todo meu corpo t cnico e as pessoas que me acompanham estou muito feliz por tudo que esta acontecendo comigo nesta temporada
4984412 isso um sonho algo inimagin vel o que esta acontecendo comigo nesta temporada nem eu mesmo posso acreditar ganhar uma medalha de ouro ser o n mero um do mundo
4984413 uma excelente temporada mas tenho que estar tranq ilo porque depois poder o vir momento ruins
4984414 nas ltimas corridas que realizamos a rapidez nas curvas tem aumentado incrivelmente em laguna seca a velocidade em linha reta foi quase a mesma que no ltimo ano por m as voltas foram 1 5 segundos mais r pidas
4984415 acho que fizemos uma grande transi o defesa ataque embora seja preciso reconhecer que o bloqueio nos ajudou muito a n o passar nenhum aperto durante toda a partida
4984416 quest o de concentra o trabalho e um pouco de sorte algu m faz o fundamento mas toda a equipe trabalha
4984417 todas as equipes sacam forte e dif cil fazer uma boa recep o para a transi o ao ataque esse o aspecto no qual acho que devemos estar mais concentradas para o resto da competi o
4984418 eu acho que cresci durante a competi o quanto mais voc compete se sente melhor com voc mesmo eu aprendi a competir eu diria a jade est melhor dentro da competi o
4984419 estou muito feliz com tudo o brasil melhorou como equipe e no individual estou feliz de ter participado da minha primeira olimp ada vindo aqui para china nesse gin sio grande e maravilhoso eu classifiquei em s timo n ent o se eu tivesse ficado em oitava eu ia ter ficado triste mas como fiquei em s timo est bom para mim
4984420 a experi ncia foi muito importante pensando em londres o meu primeiro dia eu achei muito mais dif cil do que agora no ltimo dia agora eu j estava melhor porque j conhe o a aparelhagem voc se sente bem colocada no gin sio ent o foi muito melhor
4984421 n o arrisquei queria fazer uma coisa mais segura porque eu sabia que medalha era muito muito muito dif cil pelas notas das outras meninas
4984422 estou rezando muito para o papai do c u proteger elas
4984423 a china envolve o advers rio uma equipe extremamente perigosa
4984424 um time mais alto que o jap o e tem uma levantadora excepcional
4984425 agora outro campeonato nervoso e complicado por conta da press o e da ansiedade de n o se poder perder
4984426 estamos muito bem no bloqueio mas ningu m esperava que a gente fosse fazer 3 a 0 em cinco jogos a gente tem que manter a concentra o porque o campeonato come a agora
4984427 a gente est numa crescente melhorando a rela o bloqueio e defesa todo mundo est de parab ns porque esse fundamento tem ajudado muito
4984428 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4984429 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4984430 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4984431 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4984432 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4984433 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4984434 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4984435 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4984436 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4984437 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4984438 obviously it was bad enough to come off yesterday and with injuries like that it usually takes about 48 hours for them to settle or get worse
4984439 hes got a big flight we have to manage it to ensure he gets plenty of ice on it on the way home if we keep the swelling down then he shouldnt be out for too long
4984440 they appear to be better today than they were yesterday so its encouraging
4984441 claro que consideramos este jogo uma decis o mas n o final o campeonato n o termina no domingo estamos todos conscientes sobre a import ncia do jogo importante vencermos mas teremos tamb m outras decis es depois
4984442 vai ser um jogo diferente contra o gr mio de muita correria por isso demos um descanso aos atletas e nos refor amos contra a bola rea
4984443 sem d vida falta entrosamento mas isso s se conquista jogando sei da grandeza do clube da responsabilidade que jogar aqui mas estou tranq ilo focado se come ar jogando vou dar meu melhor para ajudar o time a conquistar um bom resultado

4984461 these results suggest that the combination of insulin and other diabetes medications may beneficially influence brain changes
4984462 this also points to biological pathways in the brain such as insulin signaling that might be a focus for developing new treatment strategies
4984463 en principio no parece necesario porque esas penas ya existen aunque nada impide que se pudieran alargar o crear otras nuevas
4984464 el c digo penal de 1995 estableci que las medidas de seguridad s lo se pod an aplicar a personas inimputables o imputables parcialmente como por ejemplo personas con enfermedades mentales por lo que aplicarlas tambi n a terroristas o violadores ser a una modificaci n m s profunda
4984465 siempre se puede hacer pero tengo dudas de que pueda ser obligatorio para este tipo de delitos parece descabellado porque muy pocos terroristas reinciden al salir de la c rcel lo que lo convertir a en innecesario en esos casos perder a el sentido de vigilancia para convertirse nicamente en una pena adicional encubierta
4984466 tanto el c digo de 1973 como el de 1995 contemplan la posibilidad de que el condenado por delitos graves no se acerque al lugar de residencia de la v ctima durante cinco a os la pregunta es por qu los fiscales no la pidieron en el caso de juana
4984467 la obligaci n legal de las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad es vigilar a todo el que sea potencialmente peligroso aunque sin controlar su correspondencia sin pincharle el tel fono es decir respetando sus derechos fundamentales
4984468 en caso de que esa vigilancia se establezca con car cter general se estar a sometiendo a estos delincuentes a libertad vigilada lo que supondr a en realidad otra pena
4984469 crear una nueva pena de libertad vigilada como pretende el pp que obligue a controlar a todos los etarras que hayan cumplido esos per odos de c rcel tan prolongados parece absurdo son medidas que de aprobarse s lo se aplicar an pasadas varias d cadas mientras que los condenados por el c digo de 1973 seguir n saliendo
4984470 parece l gico desde la legalidad y t cnicamente se puede hacer pero los etarras que salgan de prisi n pr ximamente podr n establecerse donde quieran porque nada se lo impide
4984471 los de libertad personal la libertad de residencia la intimidad y la igualdad

4984747 a pesar de las resoluciones de la concejal a de urbanismo la desidia del ayuntamiento ha derivado en que el citado enclave sigue desprotegido y desde hace meses es utilizado por algunas personas como vivienda
4984748 desde entonces el pspv de valencia ha presentado dos mociones en el ayuntamiento vot a favor de una moci n en este sentido en la diputaci n de valencia

4984751 durante este tiempo el gobierno municipal encabezado por la alcaldesa de valencia rita barber no ha hecho ning n esfuerzo para que este espacio de cultura historia y de un gran valor etnol gico sea un referente cultural del centro hist rico de la ciudad y especialmente del barrio de velluters

4984761 the biology underlying this association is speculative and the relative importance of fetal nutrition versus genotype is unknown

4984767 the multitarget therapy reduces the dosages of each immunosuppressant and accordingly bears no increase in adverse effects
4984768 this strategy provides us with the opportunity to select an optimized immunosuppressive treatment for patients whose disease is refractory to the conventional therapy
4984769 multivariate analysis showed that patients under multitargeted therapy were 6 47 times more likely to enter complete remission compared with those treated with the cyclophosphamide regimen
4984770 a prolonged follow up period is needed for the exploration of this treatments impact on long term prognosis and the recurrence rate during the maintenance therapy period
4984771 successful treatment of class v iv lupus nephritis with multitarget therapy
4984772 these outcomes appear to be achieved without exposing patients to significant additional risk
4984773 experts in health economics can apply rigorous formulae to establish whether the promising data reported in these investigations are sustained and whether the new biological agents are cost effective

4984775 further research will be needed to establish the proper role of abatacept in comparison with other biological agents and to address functional outcomes the prevention and healing of joint erosions and other structural damage in juvenile idiopathic arthritis
4984776 because the study design preselects responders to placebo the possibility that an equal 30 of the active treatment group responded to a placebo effect cannot be dismissed easily indeed despite statistical significance the differences between those randomly assigned to the continued active treatment or subsequent placebo were small if we assume an equal placebo response in both groups
4984777 pediatric rheumatologists should consider the countervailing responsibility not to unnecessarily enter children into studies that subject them to placebo control with the possibility of flare and worsening of their condition when the studies are inadequately designed or powered to provide convincing proof of efficacy and safety

4984782 our study shows that if you consume oily fish at least one time per month it has a protective effect
4984783 we need to do more studies in this area because we dont know the biological mechanisms behind these findings
4984784 in regard to clinical advice i dont think we can say anything about it just yet
4984785 there might be some similar mechanisms behind cardiovascular disease and rheumatoid arthritis in regard to omega 3 fatty acids
4984786 so what doctors and patients want to know is how long it will last
4984787 could i come see you in your chambers my lady
4984788 youre a dear man but you really do worry too much
4984789 you told me once my lady that youd seen time run backwards
4984790 women who are younger than 32 are very interested in preserving fertility
4984791 thus we would recommend short term cyclophosphamide as the treatment of choice for these women
4984792 within six months we see a significant decrease in pain and significant improvement in functional ability
4984793 patients start at 80 of the maximum pain score which is severe pain and it decreases to about 20 functional ability improves to 80 or 90 within a short period after the distraction is stopped patients continue to improve over a period afterwards until they have almost complete normalization of the joint
4984794 we expect the benefits to last for at least 10 years including normal function
4984795 people who are very restricted can resume and maintain an active life
4984796 we found that total hip arthroplasty improves everyday life for patients and is as beneficial to people in their 80s or 90s as it is for someone in their 60s
4984797 physicians are less likely to present this option to the very old
4984798 but they should feel confident in recommending this procedure to those who are eligible for it
4984799 these results suggest that effective treatment for osteoporosis and successful strategies for weight control can have positive effects for joint replacement as well as overall health

4984801 one of the surprising things is that retailers are still spending money even though their businesses are under pressure now
4984802 these guys have a nice chunk of their business that comes from retail
4984803 retailers arent often on the front edge of the adopters but the good news is that if you have an attractive and functional piece of software you can really run the tables
4984804 everything we do is to drive a retailers topline sales minimize labor and reduce costs
4984805 we know that labor is the biggest cost to the retailer
4984806 its important for the buyers at the company to be able to intelligently purchase the merchandise so they know what to order for the upcoming season
4984807 it tracks transactions by customer and can allow a retailer to do more marketing campaigns based on their customer base
4984808 it allows employees to pull up a customers history and see what styles they prefer or what size they wear it also helps retailers cater to repeat customers on their birthdays and anniversaries and launch product marketing campaigns on the demographic level
4984809 dont have a large budget but they do need the technology
4984810 weve done quite well with it in the last few years
4984811 both companies we bought have relationships with ibm we resell their hardware and they sell our software
4984812 it put us in a very wonderful position to leverage that volume business and gel closer to them
4984813 i want someone to play with i dont want to play by myself i want to play with a grown up
4984814 as long as everything is exactly the way i want it im flexible
4984815 der vorgang kann nicht vollst ndig ausgef hrt werden weil ein unbekannter fehler aufgetreten ist
4984816 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4984817 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4984818 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4984819 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
4984820 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4984821 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4984822 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4984823 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4984824 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4984825 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4984826 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4984827 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4984828 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4984829 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4984830 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4984831 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4984832 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4984833 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4984834 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4984835 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4984836 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4984837 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4984838 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4984839 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4984840 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4984841 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4984842 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4984843 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4984844 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4984845 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4984846 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4984847 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4984848 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4984849 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4984850 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

4984853 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4984854 this is a planning took where all things are going
4984855 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4984856 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4984857 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4984858 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4984859 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4984860 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4984861 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4984862 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4984863 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4984864 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4984865 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4984866 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4984867 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4984868 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4984869 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4984870 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4984871 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4984872 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4984873 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4984874 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4984875 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4984876 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4984877 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4984878 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4984879 i dont think evocation is so popular in china i think a doom metal band in hong kong is more popular than us
4984880 in thailand japan and even in hong kong you have many bands which have heart quality but some bands in china beijing are not friendly as well
4984881 to reach the markets of the foreign countries is a hard thing thats because hong kong isnt a place for art and music so just some people plays we cant do many things in hong kong to let another market get to know us and many people in hong kong just have few bandsenses they dont know what a band is we just had a show in hong kong the furthest away we have played is guang zhou we still havent toured in china even in another country so we have to work hard for the result
4984882 we like black elements and music with its own style we would like to write something on what happens in our surroundings such as abortion promises the world
4984883 i think most people playing in bands dont want to do something done by others we are the same we want to create new stuff in our music non stop
4984884 i think it is our bandsenses for a hong kong band to be able to release a cd is seldom it is because recording the disc in hong kong is a hard thing its about money members time many problems afflict us being a band in hong kong is a very hard thing
4984885 i dont know if we have distribution in hong kong we just found some small cd shop to consign for sale we want to distribute to the world but still havent signed to any label and just one label replied to my e mail saying it wasnt suitable
4984886 somebody said the drumparts was terrible some that the music was messy arranged and some said it was awesome but the songs on take your soul are very old and the reason for us not recording the songs earlier is because the members werent stable until 2007 so we will be stricter from now on
4984887 the songs of evocation mainly talks about our surroundings for example there are many promises made by people without any deep thoughts those promises are usually and eventually ruined by people themselves until one dies there can be thousands or millions of broken promises made 1942 uses battle to describe how promises are broken between two persons people just like to betray each other take your soul is written to remind young people to think twice before they initiate any sexual relationship they have to think about the consequence of it if you are not well prepared you should never bring an innocent life to the cruel world otherwise you are just building up your joy on the sacrifice of the innocent baby
4984888 hong kong have professional studios but its for the rich people such as popidols to use hong kong hasnt any metalbased studios and we also lacks venues for liveshows we only have a couple and we have to buy all the recording equipment ourselves
4984889 if people are playing in their bands with heart i think buying the equipment is reasonable it isnt cheap to purchase the equipment but we save hard to buy it
4984890 we are the first black deathmetal band to release an album but we dont know who was the first band to play the black genre in hong kong
4984891 forestall or prevent the onset of the symptoms of pre eclampsia
4984892 angiotensin receptor agonistic autoantibodies induce pre eclampsia in pregnant mice
4984893 in the context of the current epidemics of obesity hypertension atrial fibrillation and heart failure the prevalence and consequences of both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea are likely to increase
4984894 the relative lack of definitive outcomes data to guide clinical practice necessitates a highly individualized approach to evaluation and management of those patients with comorbid cardiovascular disease and sleep apnea
4984895 there are no randomized trials of the effects of treatment of obstructive sleep apnea on risk of developing coronary artery disease risk of myocardial infarction or risk of cardiovascular death
4984896 there is no consensus as to whether central sleep apnea should be treated and if so what the optimal therapeutic strategy may be
4984897 sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease an american heart association american college of cardiology foundation scientific statement from the american heart association council for high blood pressure research professional education committee council on clinical cardiology stroke council and council on cardiovascular nursing
4984898 embolization of varicoceles in infertile men may be considered a useful adjunct to in vitro fertilization

4984900 embolization of varicocles pretreatment sperm motility predicts later pregnancy in partners of infertile men
4984901 the clinical significance of these findings remains to be determined
4984902 owing to the scarcity of human data in this area it is very important that this issue is examined further ideally in randomized trials

4984906 they were safe warm well fed as long as you toed the mark and went to work you were going to have a wonderful life there you got to listen to her stories hear her laughter
4984907 she says then quickly bends from the waist puts her fingertips on the ground and does alternate toe touches
4984908 i am going to laugh about it till the day i die but i am having memory problems
4984909 about three years ago when she was 79 one of her favorite alcoholic residents hed get thrown out every time he was drunk came into the common kitchen he was blubbering away and wanted to give her a big kiss she cold cocked him with a big right
4984910 i told the department of corrections dont send any hardened criminals to my moms place they said oh we wouldnt do that six months later theres a guy there who got out on a manslaughter rap as soon as my back was turned they started sending sex offenders out there
4984911 she had wonderful success with the people minnehaha county sheriff mike milstead sent out there i remember the guys in orange suits from minnehaha county they loved to come out there shed feed them and not talk down to them
4984912 many of them were dealing with the same issues she was trying to address with the men at timothys house
4984913 she was always a true champion at giving people another chance
4984914 her approach was to put her arm around their shoulder tell them youve hit rock bottom and youre going to start climbing back up and she was there to help them
4984915 cooking meals pushing people challenging them to do their best be their best it was a beautiful ministry
4984916 one guy told me one time i used to get off my tractor and come in at 4 oclock and listen to those brown kiddies
4984917 arlene carried that on she taught dancing and choreographed dancing at washington high school we all kept that stuff going and she did a lot of it
4984918 it was tough love for the whole person thats what arlene did
4984919 would be ashamed to tell god i have any complaints
4984920 somebody will walk in the door and ill know him well enough to throw my arm around him and give him a big kiss but i cant remember his name
4984921 people in this neighborhood who dont know me are going to wonder what kind of business im running

4984924 dan akan aku suruh mereka mengubah ciptaan allah lalu mereka benar benar mengubahnya
4984925 aku mendengar rasulullah saw melaknat wanita yang mengerik bulu alisnya wanita yang merenggangkan giginya agar terlihat cantik dan merubah ciptaan allah
4984926 wanita wanita yang merenggangkan giginya agar terlihat cantik yang merubah ciptaan allah
4984927 dan janganlah kamu berlebih lebihan sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang berlebih lebihan

4984930 nabi shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam telah melaknat kaum laki laki yang berpenampilan seperti wanita dan wanita yang berpenampilan laki laki
4984931 ada tiga golongan manusia yang tidak akan dipandang oleh allah azza wajalla pada hari kiamat orang yang durhaka kepada orang tua wanita yang menyerupai laki laki dan dayuts orang yang tidak punya rasa cemburu pent
4984932 rasul shallallaahu alaihi wa sallam melaknat wanita yang meniru niru laki laki
4984933 diantara perbuatan yang menyebabkan terlaknatnya wanita adalah menampakkan perhiasan emas dan berlian di balik cadar hijab dan memakai wangi wangian ketika keluar atau memakai pakaian yang mencolok norak semua itu termasuk tabarruj yang dimurkai allah dan dimurkai pula orang yang melakukannya di dunia dan akhirat

4984938 kirsten reminded me at the start gold shoes golden race
4984939 i thought we had the bronze i saw the big surge 4 100ths of a second we stayed efficient and effective through the middle 1000m and had a fairly effective start we knew in the last 500m we had to dig a lot deeper weve enjoyed rowing with each other its been fun
4984940 im ecstatic its an amazing result weve put something on the board for canada lets keep the momentum going
4984941 we were really happy to be in the final were a very stable crew and have been finalists for the past three years of course we hoped for something better but its hard to win the fight for medals well definitely be at the european championships in athens
4984942 we put in the hard work when it was needed so that we could enjoy the last 250m all according to the race plan there was no panic the whole british team is doing so well with the rowing yesterday and the swimming and the cycling and i hope it continues in the second week it bodes well for four years time
4984943 that was a very satisfactory race this is my first olympic games and its great to have a medal we had a good final sprint if there had been 50m more left we might have won but now we cant say anything gbr won and we were second
4984944 of course youre never satisfied if youre 2nd or 3rd but it hasnt been working well for us this season i guess this is the best race weve had this year we had a very good first 1000m but couldnt go any faster after that of course as world champions we are disappointed to be third weve been together for 8 years already mads rasmussen is going to take a year off and im going to try something else perhaps the lm4

4984949 i had been waiting two long years for it to make it over from japan while my 1973 mercedes 280 was falling apart beneath me
4984950 in 2005 i had a 70 mile commute from summerville to manning
4984951 i was driving a 1996 acura and was spending 15 to 20 a day for gas i purchased a used 2001 honda insight and was able to almost get to work on 1 gallon
4984952 some of the local rednecks at work would tease me
4984953 but shortly after that gas shot up to over 3 a gallon and their teasing turned into questions about how much mileage i was getting
4984954 but on a run to walterboro i got 80 mpg
4984955 it was nice to drive two weeks before having to fill up with about 8 9 gallons
4984956 fastest i have driven the car 90 mph scary at that speed
4984957 the vehicle was designed strictly for mileage it was a little loud inside and the stereo was terrible
4984958 if someone did not change their driving habits they could drain the battery in just a few miles in the city
4984959 of course gas has shot up exponentially since we sold it
4984960 lack of parts and fear of the cost to replace the hybrid battery since it was only warranted for 80 000 miles at that time hindsight is 20 20 i should have kept it
4984961 at first it was like a video game to see how high and for how long i could drive above say 100 mpg i found out where all the sweet spots were in the engine
4984962 to say that driving an insight is a zen experience may sound hokey but ive spoken to other insight owners who have claimed the same
4984963 its just a shame that honda never seriously marketed the car and closed down production in 2006
4984964 i miss the strange looks and conversations that resulted from driving this car
4984965 it was a good vehicle for its purpose and i would drive one later on when my kids get older
4984966 has more power than a mercedes smart car and is more versatile easy to drive very easy to shift and loved the engine shutting down when the car is stopped
4984967 i love my new life as a nasty cam slut

4984975 troops have captured one of ltte training bases with 100 underground bunkers
4984976 whenever we come across these types of bases and camps we will attack them and cause maximum casualties to them and this will affect their fighting capacity

4984978 i prefer to release palestinian prisoners to president mahmud abbas and prime minister salam fayyad than to hamas
4984979 this is a wrong decision its outrageous because it reduces the chances of bringing gilad shalit home
4984980 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
4984981 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4984982 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4984983 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4984984 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4984985 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
4984986 in todays and yesterdays clashes at least 23 people have been killed on both sides and 28 others were injured
4984987 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
4984988 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
4984989 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
4984990 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
4984991 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
4984992 it was as though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
4984993 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england

4984995 john was up a ladder when it collapsed i saw him fall backwards hit his head on the rockery and lose consciousness
4984996 it was almost unbearable to watch i felt sick to my stomach
4984997 i was completely wrong i should have got on the next plane home to look after my wife i am ashamed i did not
4984998 he had been gradually passing away for some time so his death seemed less of a shock than her dads accident
4984999 i picked up eight month old ellie and realised she didnt recognise me
4985000 i noticed her crying a couple of times and trying not to show it
4985001 an overwhelming wave of sadness and anxiety swept over me
4985002 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
4985003 watching mothers pressing their babies at the car windows tore my heart to shreds they made me think of ellie the tears swept over me but im pretty sure no one else noticed
4985004 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
4985005 soon pictures emerged in my head enormous terrifying images was hayley ok was my ellie all right
4985006 am i actually here and now in this room going mad
4985007 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
4985008 i never saw the ball that got me out i knew i was going to crack i threw my helmet in my bag and there in the middle of the dressing room i let it all out i said ive got to go home then i began sobbing
4985009 i rushed outside i was nervous uptight and retching and i didnt want to cause any more of a scene in front of the other players but fletch england coach duncan fletcher grabbed me to get me out of sight at that point i was a shell i didnt care id lost the will to do anything else
4985010 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
4985011 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
4985012 i asked the umpire if i could go off for a leak and i never came back
4985013 it was though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
4985014 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the bastard had returned and the shadow cast by its black wings consumed me again
4985015 the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts
4985016 i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england
4985017 i wouldnt have wished my illness on my worst enemy but for now i can go home pick up my kids give hayley a squeeze and know i am so blessed that i have come back

4985027 acting is definitely harder for women women kind of wilt as men sort of achieve as they get older like wine or whatever its like oh shes past her prime and she cant play a sex symbol its just a preconceived notion about women in general and particularly in this industry its a very vain vain industry

4985030 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4985031 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4985032 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4985033 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4985034 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4985035 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4985036 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4985037 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4985038 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4985039 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4985040 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4985041 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4985042 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4985043 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4985044 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4985045 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4985046 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4985047 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4985048 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4985049 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4985050 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4985051 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4985052 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4985053 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4985054 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4985055 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4985056 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4985057 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4985058 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4985059 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4985060 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4985061 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4985062 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4985063 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4985064 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4985065 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4985066 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4985067 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4985068 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4985069 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4985070 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4985071 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4985072 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

4985080 the community housing group have been very non plussed it has been very difficult to get anything out of them they have not helped at all
4985081 i was very upset by what i saw people are being neglected in this ward and something has to be done about it things definitely have to start to improve
4985082 we have upgraded and replaced the water pipes to a number of homes in upton road so that residents can have individual supplies with stop taps at each property instead of being on a group main
4985083 although problems with getting access to some homes have caused a delay in completing the works we are now awaiting connection to the mains supply by severn trent
4985084 our economy has become more vibrant and diversified we lack talent and workers without their participation there will not be enough singapore workers to grow the economy foreign talent also strengthen our ranks in sports because we welcome talent we can compete above our class
4985085 the problem is acute for chinese whose tfr is 1 14 this is below the national average this means each family is only replacing either the father or mother the numbers will decline rapidly in a few generations
4985086 quanto importante soprattutto nel nostro tempo che ogni comunit cristiana approfondisca sempre pi questa sua consapevolezza al fine di aiutare anche la societ civile a superare ogni possibile tentazione di razzismo di intolleranza e di esclusione e ad organizzarsi con scelte rispettose della dignit di ogni essere umano
4985087 una delle grandi conquiste dellumanit infatti proprio il superamento del razzismo purtroppo per di esso si registrano in diversi paesi nuove manifestazioni preoccupanti legate spesso a problemi sociali ed economici che tuttavia mai possono giustificare il disprezzo e la discriminazione razziale
4985088 preghiamo perch dovunque cresca il rispetto per ogni persona insieme alla responsabile consapevolezza che solo nella reciproca accoglienza di tutti possibile costruire un mondo segnato da autentica giustizia e pace vera

4985095 when i find myself taking the wrong step i find that a lot of the time it is because i am trying to protect myself and not do gods work
4985096 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4985097 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me

4985115 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
4985116 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4985117 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4985118 there was collaboration between baghdad police and neighbouring provinces of karbala there were special forces from the who also took part
4985119 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4985120 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4985121 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
4985122 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4985123 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4985124 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4985125 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4985126 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4985127 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4985155 i would have taken yesterdays result anyway but im much happier to have gone out and beaten people like that and won the race thats for sure
4985156 its nice to have a really good breeze and to go out and use your fitness and your speed and sail a good race its a much more satisfying way to win

4985162 my moms told me i had better make the team because she wants to go to rome

4985170 we came here with high expectations to go one better than last year but there were still good things to come out it

4985173 it is not right to take the childrens bread and throw it to the dogs

4985175 but jesus you promised you promised deliverance from the devil and his minions i may be a dog but you came to deliver me and all i need is a crumb all i need is a word and the demon will depart and my daughter will be healed
4985176 something must have stirred the ancient beasts to create such calamity
4985177 i did not let the chance go i knew i could do it
4985178 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
4985179 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
4985180 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
4985181 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
4985182 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
4985183 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
4985184 if you knew what i knew you would vote the way that i voted

4985190 i guess you didnt baptise her everyone who isnt baptised comes here

4985193 so how come you live down here werent you baptised
4985194 nah im not really into all that religious bollocks come on were nearly there
4985195 a crise tem a vantagem de seleccionar os mais capazes e s lidos h sempre gente que se safa nestas situa es
4985196 in other words you can t fire us but we can quit at least from those obsolete parts that we judge

4985198 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
4985199 no i cant if i sell my house people will be very frustrated not knowing how much it sold for but if i dont want to divulge it i dont have to divulge it
4985200 well we cant pander to people who might have some special needs to do something
4985201 the only one of its type in the southern hemisphere
4985202 as winter weather bites so have the electricity bills with heat pumps being blamed for skyrocketing accounts some south island consumers who complained after seeing their power bills more than double from last year have been have been told there is nothing faulty with their metering or billing contact energy told the southland times it had investigated a number of complaints this week including several from customers who had power bills leap by more than 500
4985203 trustpower staff told disgruntled timaru customer moira melhopt that a heat
4985204 more and more new zealanders are getting heat pumps so all retailers will be facing similar issues
4985205 im so excited right now i dont even have words
4985206 i decided i was going to go in the 800 and run it really hard
4985207 im extremely happy and proud today because we have made a breakthrough in the rowing history of china
4985208 at the final point when we finally reached the finishing line i was very very excited and i thought to myself finally we have won this gold for china
4985209 we decided that we have to turn this pressure into motivation
4985210 i think that says a lot for the u s program
4985211 the women clasped their hands together and raised them in unison as if they were the cast of a broadway play out for a curtain call goodale wiped away tears as she received her flowers
4985212 they were ready they came down smiling to the boathouse which is a good sign
4985213 i was thinking that a lot of people have said that its impossible for chinese rowers to get a gold in the olympic games
4985214 china revamped its approach and dedication toward winning medals in rowing the country imported coaches rowers trained longer hours and more cash was pumped into the program to make the chinese athletes contenders on their home water
4985215 im trying to hold it together what an immense achievement
4985216 my philosophy is i would trade anything for an olympic medal so it means a lot
4985217 two years ago wendy was a dentist and rebecca was a rower and now theyre olympic champion and olympic silver medalist
4985218 to get them both into the olympic final i couldnt be more proud
4985219 she has been a strong advocate of the coaching and support system used by british cycling that has produced remarkable results in recent years and says other british federations should take it up
4985220 romero will compete again on monday in the womens points race an event she has only tried once before yet the pressure will be on her to claim a medal there too every single british cyclist who has competed so far has taken a medal
4985221 i think weve got a great model a great system weve got athletes whove got a great camaraderie no one wants to be the failure weve got the best of everything and thats why it works
4985222 the south korean and taiwanese cheering fans are so advanced
4985223 chinese soccer fans are going to do the wave and cheer their hearts out
4985224 but baseball is hardly watched in china so you cant expect them to know how to react when the organ charge
4985225 in preparation for the games organizers created an official cheer for chinese spectators clap twice give the thumbs up clap twice more and throw both fists into the air all while chanting
4985226 its my first basketball game so i just yelled whenever the guy in front of me started chanting go china lu qun 45 said during chinas recent victory over germany
4985227 in chinese to yell defense or charge sounds silly but i want to invent some catchy chinese slogans for future games
4985228 some chinese spectators also have found it hard to control their excitement particularly at tennis matches audiences are supposed to remain silent during each point so a player can hear the ball coming off an opponents racket
4985229 i just want to cheer every time li na hits the ball in
4985230 sometimes its just too suffocating to contain my excitement so ill let out a yelp
4985231 some tennis olympians initially unnerved were won over by the chinese fans passion
4985232 its unbelievable for me this is the best moment in my career ill never forget it
4985233 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
4985234 yan zi and zheng jie of china beat ukraines alona and kateryna bondarenko for the bronze 6 2 6 2 the womens singles final began with only about a thousand spectators in the 10 000 seat stadium but it was mostly full by the end 2 1 2 hours later
4985235 to serve you have to push yourself up to jump up and when the legs are a little bit slow it just doesnt go
4985236 in the final set safina broke her racket when she double faulted three times to lose serve and fall behind 3 1
4985237 i want to put a hyphen between the words fish and and and and and chips in my fish and chips sign

4985261 the 14 year old newcomer to the national team who was recruited last year has raised a lot of eyebrows recently after she broke two world records on the uneven bars in as many months
4985262 the 13 year old uneven bar gymnast he kexin who defeated national team athlete yang yilin she just won the bronze medal in the world championships has demonstrated her ability
4985263 we heard these rumors and we immediately wrote to the chinese gymnastics federation
4985264 they immediately sent a copy of the passport showing the age and everything is ok thats all we can check
4985265 as long as we have no official complaint there is no reason to act if we get a passport that obviously is in order
4985266 gordon robertson inquires into the source of the high temperatures inside the earth and then correctly speculates that tidal friction might be one source however decay of radioactive nuclei is considered to be the more important source although i dont have the numbers at hand we can calculate the amount of energy coming from tidal friction by measuring the rate at which the earths rotation is slowing down

4985313 each cockroach produces 600 babies in their lifetime and we have more than 100 entrants so our success to date is that we are reducing 60 000 cockroaches without using any chemicals at all and thats the beauty of it

4985315 we went out with the soldiers and a lot of them helped us because we know them
4985316 i didnt think we had a winner because a lot of people brought big ones and there were many almost as big as this one
4985317 the prize money is fine but we spent quite a lot of money to get it
4985318 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind

4985320 we know very well well not be about to win the war against insects they have been here much longer than us cockroaches were here 350 million years ago

4985357 misschien naar de bodem van de amstel die boot heeft zijn beste tijd gehad
4985358 het zit zo mijn boot ligt hier al jaren aan de amstel en stiekem woon ik op deze boot nu heb ik een vrouwtje ontmoet en zij vindt het raar dat ik hier woon toch wil ze met me trouwen alleen moet ik dan bij haar komen wonen ik weiger dat en nu heeft ze mijn boot vernield terwijl ik sliep nu ga ik haar huis ook vernielen want boontje komt op zijn loontje nu wil ik u vragen of u haar uit haar huisje wilt lokken

4985371 twintig knopen wind en bijna geen zichtbaarheid ik ging bij de boot van start en klapte gelijk naar rechts het kwam echter slechter dan slecht uit halverwege het eerste kruisrak moest ik vijftien boten voor mij laten van links de motor ging erop ik hing de longen uit mijn lijf en maakte een grote comeback om als 5e de bovenboei te ronden voor de wind was het zoeken naar de boei
4985372 in het tweede kruisrak ging ik links maar nu bleek rechts beter te zijn ik verloor twee plekjes en kwam als 7e rond de bovenboei in het laatste voor de windse rak sloeg de canadese om en daardoor won ik nog een plekje 6e het regende flink en de zichtbaarheid was niet opperbest maar er stond wind en ik keek uit naar de volgende race er kwamen opklaringen de mist trok op en we werden naar binnen gestuurd uitstel op de kant onvoorstelbaar
4985373 de star de tornado de yngling finn en zelfs de 49er waren wedstrijden aan het zeilen na een half uurtje op de kant werden onze races afgelast iedereen stond perplex waarom lassen ze de wedstrijden in godsnaam af voor eens dat er wind staat
4985374 we reaffirm what we know from the epidemiology of aging that there is a very strong correlation between common medical conditions and a predisposition to sleep disturbances
4985375 a person may have several medical conditions that theyre seeing their doctor about and they may be getting treatment but they dont feel theyre getting better
4985376 the poll results show we need to educate the public and healthcare professionals about the connection between sleep health and aging
4985377 sleep is as important as food and air quantity and quality are very important most adults need between 7 5 to 8 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep if you press the snooze button on the alarm in the morning you are not getting enough sleep
4985378 avoid bright light around the house before bed using dimmer switches in living rooms and bathrooms before bed can be helpful dimmer switches can be set to maximum brightness for morning routines
4985379 dont stress if you feel you are not getting enough sleep it will just make matters worse know you will sleep eventually no pressure
4985380 avoid exercise near bedtime no exercise at least 3 hours before bed
4985381 dont go to bed hungry have a light snack avoid a heavy meal before bed
4985382 bedtime routines are helpful for good sleep keep routines on your normal schedule a cup of herbal tea an hour before bed can begin a routine
4985383 avoid looking at the clock if you wake up in the middle of the night it can cause anxiety this is very difficult for most of us so turn the clock away so you would have to turn it to see the time you may decide not to make the effort and go right back to sleep
4985384 if you cant get to sleep for over 30 minutes get out of bed and do something boring in dim light till you are sleepy
4985385 keep your bedroom at comfortable temperature not too warm and not too cold cooler is better than warmer
4985386 if you have problems with noise in your environment you can use a white noise generator an old fan will work or you can listen to soft music on a timer
4985387 if you have a sleeping partner ask them if they notice any snoring leg movements and or pauses in breathing if you have any concerns see your doctor

4985607 hey there i uh have you trapped youre going to be my dinner tonight would you rather be eaten alive or if not could you please go behind that tree over there and kill your self in any way you see fit so i can eat you and afterwards complete one of those circle of life things and not affect in any kind of negative way our karma as such
4985608 ive been thinking about all this stuff ive been reading back at the swamp lately
4985609 dude you know that reading is bad for you because it gives you weird ideas and you always start tripping out and doing things
4985610 thats all very fine and happy my dear panda but i choose to expand my mind in more active ways than passive ways such as meditation and mustard rubbing i want to act i want to start something crazy and violent that will wake the sheep from their complacent slumber
4985611 its going a be great were going to get all dressed up suburban terrorist like and run through the streets screaming and protesting
4985612 well what are you going to protest then are you going to protest about the inequality between the working class and the greedy corporations who rule the world and brain wash us with their incessant commercials or what about protesting the destruction that automobiles cause to the environment with fossil fuels i mean personally i think that that might be a good one because these people are like exploiting your ancestors man
4985613 how about a demonstration demanding the liberation of all the enslaved packets of mustard being held hostage by the evil fast food grease pits
4985614 hey bro i just wanted to say that i feel really bad about using you like that the other day so i could get free weed its just that you are like really intimidating like and really scare people really bad and i didnt have any cash that day and everybody wanted cash and i just didnt have any other alternative i hope you understand
4985615 its ok i mean i could eat you anytime i wanted to but when i look into those fury black eyes of yours i understand something about myself i never understood before and it makes me feel um different
4985616 i know how you feel i could run away from you anytime i wanted to or i could even take you to court because youre like supposed to be extinct and stuff and your not but i dont do that because i believe that every living creature should be able to thrive even if it thrives on the bloody carnivorous murder of innocent plant eating creatures such as myself
4985617 we are our own anchor in this sea of chaos
4985618 gee it looks kinda cute all sniveling like that its emo ness must be beginning to take effect on me better to kill it now before i succumb to its power
4985619 thats exactly what i mean its like all i want is
4985620 im going to chop your leg off with my sword right here right now
4985621 screaming screaming oh my god the screams are like freaking everywhere screaming their rotten brains out all glorious like making me like freaking trip out man oh man oh man something like freaking sloppy greasy glory and they wallow in it shamelessly bragging about it all and even chatty like and afterwards when theyre all dazed out happy like nirvana bliss in their bloated goat fleshy mayhem theyll swear that none of it ever happened it was all a day dream theyll tell you while patting you on the shoulder all best of buddies like and heard you on out the door
4985622 dude you need to like calm down man smoke a joint or something i mean you really need to start laying off all the gak man its twisting you a little bit
4985623 you never existed either in their moist and chaotic world no not at all youre just a silly little shot in the mouth something to be swallowed digested and shat back out into the happy world that belongs to somebody else but only on saturdays and the following tuesday of every third month following leap year that is and when the whole solar energy cosmos thingies with all those stars are like lined up right that is but dont let that head fuck you too much man because im there for you and in the end it doesnt really add up to that much action anyways not as much as theyd like you to think that is anyways my brother
4985624 its the screams though after a while you start hearing them whenever and everywhere like and even after they are long gone absorbed into what ever it is that screaming gets absorbed into when the screaming settles down to a mere panting and you can still hear all the echoes bouncing back and forth back and forth like a mutha fuckin ping pong ball in your skull
4985625 sounds like fun doesnt it the screams can and will eventually consume you into junky paranoid neurotic criminal tendencies and it stops being a game of instant gratification it becomes a real pain in the ass i mean can you imagine what its like trying to make love to your special loved one when all you hear are these pulsing screams of some humanoid like thing which might be like fun and all but then again are you just like not at all too sure because those damned screams are just so intense my god is she getting off or is getting chopped up into little tiny bite size pieces of love its getting pretty damned hard to tell the difference here though and if anybody would like to lend me a hand i wouldnt mind the help
4985626 but anyways there was a point to all this but alas she chopped it off tossed it to the frothing snapping zombie piranhas of her soul oh yeah and like some freudian vagina dentate nightmare there is not much that can be done about it acceptance is like the key here my friend and its detrimental that we understand that right here and right now because if we dont then there wouldnt be much of a reason to go on with this tasty bit of bullshit as such ahhhh the great bullshit as such enlightening all those who are eager to serve and obey absolutely nothing but who still suffer from a lack of that happy ole meta astro metaphysical duel dementia that almost or more or less always makes sense when really really wanted to but back to the screams what was it im reaching down down down dirty and deep into that slimy wretched gaping gash of gnashing teeth and im pulling out my point that i had almost like lost forever down there and wanted to share with you man because i know you understand and did you know that they were telling me just the other day as a matter of fact that it is all wrong doing this what i do but i always insist that repressing socio cidal behavior is not at all for a happy healthy heart body and soul a good thing repression is bad its bad bad bad let it out embrace it and let it grow let it flow and flow and flow and flow some more all over the place for all to experience and enjoy just like the constant screaming that never seems to end i screamed her name in the early morning darkness the other day but i dont think she heard us heard me i mean ahem well like i said there was something about social suicide that i find seemingly romantic when its mixed up all cocktail like with other fun things as such know what i mean im sure they do im sure they do the mysterious black eyed woman whispered in my dirty constant screaming filled ear right before kneeing me in the balls the other day at the club at least she seemed to understand my inner emotions that nobody understands mind if we get emo on you here i mean would anybody mind if i got all emo here maybe the screams i hear are all the repressed emo like repressions and forsaken emotions that i have happy socked into the great void thing in the sky of someone elses world i just dont know anymore
4985627 well its about time you get here man soup bone here is really beginning to freak out i think he needs a little sleep
4985628 the scale is there underneath the table if you want to weigh it out or anything
4985629 give me a hand with putting him back into his hole
4985630 oh man those guys are so freaking crazy they are all about the end of the world and stuff and thats why it took me so long i had to sit there and listen to cletus go on and on about how the government is going to establish a police state and everybody and everything will be placed under marshal law or some wacked out shit like that
4985631 dude this totally looks like something cletus would write i mean this is insane what the hell is he doing with this
4985632 hes got a whole stack of them back at their compound and he gave me this one to photo copy and distribute
4985633 hey man i got to get going im supposed to cook dinner for my wife tonight and im already late shes gonna be pissed if her dinner isnt ready by the time she gets home
4985634 you got to play the happy husband tonight asked scab
4985635 yeah i havent been home for a few days and so i like got to get some cool points back in the account
4985636 aww man i met this really hot chica last week at a hardcore show and i ended up hanging around with her for a few days while my wife was hanging out in spain
4985637 and she doesnt mind you hanging out with some chica
4985638 not as long as her dinner is ready before she gets home from work tonight
4985639 uhh i was a victim of a terrorist attack i was held hostage for exactly one and a half hours by a band of rouge terrorists trying to destroy the world before the negotiators could get me rescued honest babe i tried and tried and pleaded and begged them to let me go so i could be home in time to cook dinner but they showed no mercy until the negotiators brought them a twelve pack of beer and a pizza sorry babe
4985640 he has way too many problems and doesnt know what he wants in life
4985641 but im like talking about real love here cletus not about what we see on tv or in the movies but real love that love which emanates straight from the source that fills us with hope and the desire to live and be loved and to do great things things which may or may not seem to have a point
4985642 oh the lost and lonely little jar of mustard sitting there alone in the darkness of its shelf all alone and red eyed weepy like because it couldnt bear the thought of there being other flavors of mustard as well or the man who sits in the bar drinking himself into oblivion because his expectations of women are like totally twisted like from all the porno movies he watches for hours and hours on end and he actually thinks that women are such sluts and treats them that way and wonders why they kick him in the balls whenever he tries to talk to them oh what rot love is love is love and what is love i know that i love my mustard and they way mustard makes me feel shows me how mustard feels about me but at the same time cletus and you must understand that there are so many different kinds of mustards and life is short and different mustards must be sampled in order to gain the ultimate mustard experience how could i possibly experience the full mustard experience if i only had just one kind really humans should learn to embrace this philosophy and not just for the simple fact that its so much fun but for the enlightening opportunities it has to offer as well
4985643 in just a few years the net has become part of the fabric of our lives and the laws affecting what we can do see or say online are being drafted now
4985644 your kohai said that its daring whats so daring about it is it because its very depressing
4985645 alys nee chan requested that it cannot be seen anywhere but the exhibition she sat for me and as the creator i must respect my sitters wishes
4985646 i know what she looks like unless you painted her like a witch did you paint her as a witch nino calls her cynical little witch sometimes
4985647 no peeping satoshi kun its to be a secret i think its fun dont you
4985648 i dont know it could turn out really bad and your exhibition
4985649 i mean how do i reach you by post if i have to while youre on tour
4985650 alys nee chan asked when she emailed yesterday she wont be back till august and wants to send something to nino kun so that it would reach him on time
4985651 address at the back but not her handwriting the head office transferred it here postmarked late last week receipt enclosed and happy birthday make sure you dont muck up on stage tonight or ill break your legs
4985652 we need to find matsumoto about the placements tonight im worried about the balloons that he wants to use ohno kun too
4985653 alys san wrote that its a private gift let us give nino some time to enjoy it before we barge in with the cake that matsumoto would have cajoled from manager san in a few minutes
4985654 since when do we care about things like private gifts
4985655 since alys san is capable of biting our heads off if we do not let her do what she wants on her birthday and ninos
4985656 your mama as you call her has a temper masaki baby and will not be pleased that we disobeyed instructions then theres the added fact that we have to give him his presents what did you get him
4985657 jun and i got him a baseball and football game thingy alys san said he wanted it
4985658 manager san decided to be cheap and pay for the cake what did alys san send him that he had to open it in private
4985659 something from england i thought she would send us sweets she said well all get presents when she gets back
4985660 captain riida oh chan i know youre out there i need you in here and only you
4985661 she wants me to go to exhibition in autumn even though im not that big into art
4985662 because theres an oil on canvas version of this that she says she intends to buy from your girlfriend at a discount
4985663 shed never win any beauty contests but what a damn fine woman she is isnt she
4985664 of course i am i want to see what else is in that painting
4985665 her letter stated that work always had an unusual twist in them i shall look forward to the twist in this one shes wonderfully unpredictable ne
4985666 ill accompany you to exhibition when it opens ne if those idiots ask she got me a new game
4985667 as much as the money from this do will off set the amount ive spent at that shop we went to the other day i rather that i was seeing her off at the airport instead cant i have both the money for this booking and my alys
4985668 i should between her and me we are the seven deadly sins we should have it all i shouldnt have to choose between avarice and a selfish private desire
4985669 but she gave you the spare keys to her place
4985670 mamas blanket it smells like mama you miss her already i do too
4985671 why would i miss her when i have oh chan here
4985672 thoughts of stealing captain hadnt crossed my mind but i could always scheme with alys nee chan how we could be rid of nino
4985673 has it ever occurred to you boys to be on your best behaviour when we arrive at our destination
4985674 this isnt a concert where no one will see what you lot are really like backstage you will be on scrutiny tonight for about five songs and half an hours circulation with the whos who of the publishing company do not i repeat do not give me any reason to want to hang my head in shame and deny ever knowing any of you
4985675 if you hang your head too low it would drag on the floor and we wouldnt have a manager oh wait not having a manager would be a good thing we could actually do what we liked for a change
4985676 how is it that chiaki sama can train sakurai to be better behaved in public whereas miyuki no miya cant even reform you
4985677 mama says shell bring back brighton rock sweets for me
4985678 ne riida nino said something about watching jun being funny is he going to do something
4985679 sho chan save me riida wants to drag me to nino im going to go hungry and starve to death sho chan save me
4985680 thats just sakiyama sensei talking to manager san and introducing her to jun its her book thingy that was put out ne
4985681 do you ever use your eyes and brain in conjunction with one another aiba chan that is one of juns favourite authors shouldnt he at least keep a respectful distance away from her but no hes leaning towards her captain analysis please
4985682 papa will spank you if youre bad its time to meet juns girl shes clearly met sho its our turn
4985683 drop jun hes a butt less baka who will only find faults with you i on the other hand have a penchant for intelligent and capable women what do you say sakiyama sensei
4985684 the love rival and villain in my next book will be modelled after you i can just see it now a young man so dissipated that he blights everything he touches will be tempted by the purity and innocence of the heroine who clearly loves this other person who wouldnt give her the time of day as hes too busy pursuing an outwardly beautiful woman the villain steps up to her and propositions her no thats too much too early in the story however the premise is interesting
4985685 at last someone other than the long suffering alys who sees our diminutive bastard for what he is
4985686 the professors our little buggers girl believe it or not
4985687 youll only encourage his nonsense telling nino that youll put him in your book will only blow up his already inflated ego
4985688 oh oh name the hero masaki after me i can tell my mother that im a hero in the book because a friend wrote it that way were friends now okay because youre matsujuns girl and were all friends and girlfriends of friends are friends too like aki chan and mama
4985689 be quiet aiba chan alys nee chan must be sneezing furiously at your indiscriminate name dropping
4985690 well sora chan these walking pustules are my friends sho you already know for being sillier than he looks nino lately of the mindset that hes gift to women of the intelligentsia aiba constantly active because he has invisible ants in his pants and captain ohno sometimes called riida artist extraordinaire who does nothing yet stabilises our group guys i present to you the author of the bleeding piano and other titles
4985691 how much did they pay you to endorse her books matsujun
4985692 if the moneys that good ill do it i look more studious than you at any rate
4985693 ah ha i knew it i knew it vindication at last
4985694 a little over a week but i didnt figure out her surname then
4985695 matsujun you did one better than me with kujo san and i thought i had the best deal youve got some nerve outdoing me butt less baka
4985696 hardly anyone would believe that a member of the kujo ke would publish a modern romance novel so nee sama and i coined up this name i would prefer it if you would just called me sora
4985697 thank you all for being here i had no idea jun chan and nee sama arranged for this im terribly sorry for interrupting your busy schedules
4985698 iya please dont say that youre going to embarrass us or me because these guys you know have no shame because theyre all so thick skinned
4985699 what do you take me for of course he knows the old man knows too everythings hush hush because were supposed to have no private lives and sora chan isnt officially supposed to have anyone in her life either
4985700 it would appear that the publishers and literary agents do not believe a novelist who writes realistic romances should be officially attached it all works to our benefit
4985701 uwah youve got everything worked out already and we only just met sora chan i can call you sora chan ne how did matsujun get everything done so quickly
4985702 coming clean with the establishment and letting her management talk to our management and here we are it pays to be serious about things aiba chan
4985703 dont talk down to him the shakespearean fool is not to be offended remember what happened in
4985704 youre nice not like matsujun at all i want a girlfriend too riida were the two old men left without wives what are we going to do
4985705 resign yourself to fate youre much too crazy a handful for anyone to handle
4985706 its a non fiction title on ipe i need someone with your expertise in the field
4985707 oh chan do you suppose we can complain to the opera house for suddenly cancelling concerts alys chan wants me to get a refund on an opera thats been cancelled for some nonsensical reason she wanted to see that show badly
4985708 thats the point well blend right in want anything food drinks
4985709 ne can a person be like a kogepan i feel like im a kogepan
4985710 mama says the kogepan anime has philosophical meaning because it means were all the same inside you think thats true and if were all the same inside were all really like kogepan if we are then no one would hurl themselves in rivers or talk about hurling themselves on train tracks
4985711 get french apple tarts for alys chan will you i want to surprise her when she gets back tomorrow
4985712 that shop doesnt open on saturdays and besides i dont have to pay matsujun or sho back
4985713 i could do it myself but im kind of busy right now its not easy plotting all the evil things i do
4985714 is it me or is jun a tad on the suspicious side today
4985715 shos choice of literature does not exactly coincide with his
4985716 im not going to follow them its too hot to go out anyway
4985717 dont you ever pay attention to what our manager says well weve a got a booking next weekend a private event for alliance publishing house an author of theirs sakiyama jewel has launched a new book and shes a fan of ours i dont know who pulled the strings but were performing there even though we dont usually do gigs like that a couple of songs a few smiles and we get paid decently
4985718 eh what has that got to do with sho and jun and the coincidence thing you mentioned
4985719 is the gist of my exposition one of matsujuns favourite authors is sakiyama jewel the book comes out today it said so there
4985720 will you two idiots just believe me already theres more to this sakiyama jewel and jun than meets the eye
4985721 yes i do mean that our manager knows already otherwise he wouldnt be fussing over the arrangements with jun this is my revenge for his sneaking up on alys chan and me
4985722 are you sure just because juns a fan of the author and the authors a fan of ours doesnt mean that he and she are like what you say they are
4985723 well i will tell you ye of little grey matter it means that it no longer is a coincidence
4985724 there will be no interference if were already there to play around with any scheme our pretty boy butt less baka has in place
4985725 so che qualcuno ha criticato la corsa afferma regina satariano che ha fatto da madrina della manifestazione esortando i concorrenti ad
4985726 a volte si tende a prendersi troppo sul serio e si dimentica che una risata pu unire pi di una lacrima
4985727 you asked your mother where to make the jewellery you designed for her that kills the surprise ne riida
4985728 she doesnt mind besides nino needs to know where the shop is too
4985729 dont be like that its not a secret for you anymore but its still a secret for me
4985730 you dont want the rest of them to learn about kaoru chan only when youve popped out a child or two do you
4985731 what about you dont you want to get married and have kids
4985732 kids hell no alys chan and i dont want any just as well that shes too sickly to have them it means i dont have to share her with anyone marriage isnt all it is cracked to be itd be hell when we fight over stuff at the divorce she and i cant be bound by conventions anyway
4985733 besides why have kids when we could borrow yours and corrupt it
4985734 yeah she didnt say whether its a good or bad one
4985735 i know a place but i can only take you there and leave you stranded im meeting chiaki in a bit
4985736 oh sho why do you always leave me high and dry and stranded and bereft have you no compassion for my nerves
4985737 quality workmanship is one thing paying your establishment to replicate the designs in all their intricacy is reasonable but no one charges that much for pearls if you can knock off 4000 yen for rubies you could at least take 7000 yen off for a single black pearl drop
4985738 the amount we get for the thing at the book house is more than what it costs alys wouldnt like it if she finds out youre bargaining
4985739 she would push me out the door and bargain herself because i couldnt get the price any lower
4985740 look thats how much your down payment is settle that and dont bother me im trying to get a good price for the black pearls
4985741 dont bother me im going to get at least 5000 yen off here
4985742 oi ojisan your wallet and the receipt they need two months dont lose the receipt
4985743 i just burnt a large hole in my pocket with the down payment for the necklace and the pearls guess i have to give up cutting my hair and give up eating for a while to get the money back
4985744 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
4985745 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due
4985746 sri lanka is one of the toughest places to play cricket as you dont get a lot of runs on slow low wickets you have to always stay positive
4985747 it will be an exciting one day series they will want to make sure after losing the test series that they go home with a win in one dayers
4985748 murali and mendis together make it a top bowling attack we will have to do really well to defeat sri lanka
4985749 this has been what hes wanted to do ever since he heard of make a wish and the doctors said pick something and they thought theres no way the marines will do that and we didnt think they would either
4985750 in the past we thought if a marine had post traumatic stress disorder he was gone now its more like breaking a leg
4985751 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4985752 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4985753 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4985754 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4985755 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4985756 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4985757 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4985758 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4985759 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic

4985768 i would say hes right on track with whats going on nationally
4985769 dont understand why mayors shouldnt be part of the education solution
4985770 mayors are playing an important role a more formal role because voters see it as the mayors obligation
4985771 former mayor laura miller and i we didnt talk on a regular basis
4985772 mr leppert was the only candidate for mayor who came to visit me and ask what it was we needed
4985773 were going to see how these programs roll out will they work we dont know but theyll make for an interesting study

4985941 well youre partially correct its not a fight but shell never have him hes belonged to you for far too long and somewhere deep down inside she knows shes using what little ammunition she has in a fight that you won long ago she just isnt ready to concede defeat quite yet
4985942 i saw you crying when you left the common room im sorry it hurts you to see them together dont call her a slag shes not you know she loves him hes not just someone to pass the time she really loves him and i hate that hes stringing her along the way he is her body is all she thinks she has left to fight you with and shes desperate to hang on to him no matter the cost
4985943 i dont know why you think he wants me we can barely say a civil word to one another these days
4985944 because you dont see the way he looks at you when he knows youre not watching its you he wants hermione lavenders simply available
4985945 i wont bother you anymore i just wanted to make sure you were okay and at least try to make you see things from her perspective
4985946 im glad we talked thank you it means a lot that you came to find me
4985947 ive been so jealous of her im still jealous that she has what i want so desperately but now i feel i dont know sad too i guess

4985969 this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing swimming
4985970 i think its probably one of the greatest things sport in general has ever seen
4985971 the shame of it is other athletes arent going to realize how hard it is the world is fast in swimming right now the world was not fast when mark spitz did his seven
4985972 i just feel very privileged that i got to watch michael phelps win eight gold medals thats been the highlight of my olympics
4985973 when you come out and swim fast times people realize that it can be done
4985974 you set that bar a bit high and people are going to come with you

4985983 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4986089 even if we break up theres no chance shell go for a skinny butt less baka with nicer clothes than she does and who thinks romance novelists are far prettier than her alys chan may not be beautiful in your eyes but at least she doesnt have more hair than wit like you do

4986092 eh youre meeting mama mamas back will she bring back the wife biscuits from hong kong for me you think i want to go too
4986093 has it occurred to you that she may not be there she would have only touched down at the airport early this morning after a twenty hours flight
4986094 ohno kun i have a tension headache so i am going to be blunt would you care to enlighten me on the nature of your relationship or relationship or even chiakis relationship to the painter morimoto kaoru
4986095 you call her kaoru just who is she to you
4986096 er i just know her youre doing something for her exhibition why how
4986097 tonight news zero will be broadcasting a segment tonight on the toyomi hoshina senseis launch of his prot g es work i was asked to cover it i had a sneak peek at the gallery very impressive stuff the research undertaken revealed that this prot g e one morimoto kaoru by name had her formal artistic debut designing the background sets for the second act of amatsukaze your butai project last year i dug deeper and visited the gedai founders memorial gallery today for a sneak preview of morimoto kaorus reflections guess what i found
4986098 nudes of alys and chiaki entitled the philosophers secret and the birth of natures protectress respectively ive nothing against nudes those were very artistic and well executed however i am struck by the coincidences how did toyomi hoshinas prot g e come to be acquainted with two arashi girlfriends
4986099 that was my initial thought given the little chiaki told me about the artist friend she met with alys that was my exact thought until i learnt that morimoto san had been the background set designer for act two of amatsukaze and then saw a painting of a very familiar baseball cap entitled satoshi two coincidences i can stomach three is where i begin to suspect something four is when it stops being a coincidence
4986100 youre as much in the dark as i am then
4986101 i know about kaoru and alys but even then ive not see the piece i thought of just going to the exhibition tomorrow when it opens to see the pieces i didnt know about the rest
4986102 okay ohno kun this is getting weird chiaki and i are headed for dinner i would greatly appreciate it if you joined us and well have a parlay at mejiro two shops down the sushi place manager san always takes us to
4986103 a wolf pack of at least 30 thugs viciously attacked two hero

4986106 she was screaming and all we did was look to help her i got a bottle smashed over my head and after that i started fighting but i got beat down
4986107 when i showed up there were a lot of people there people on the left and people on the right and then boom i got hit and passed out
4986108 those in the crowd were yelling hey white boys youre in the hood now we were yelling back we dont care we live here
4986109 chris asked his father if i could come to dinner brian said no because robots cant eat dinner please teach me how to eat dinner so that i can go with chris next time
4986110 im afraid that metabolising food isnt the sort of thing you can be taught how to do you just werent designed for it but i think brian was only trying to tell chris no in the nicest way possible because he didnt want to argue with chris about whether he could bring you
4986111 like when he told chris i had to stay in the bedroom while he went to call gramma because robots cant make phone calls
4986112 or the time he told chris i couldnt come to the beach because robots cant swim
4986113 or when chris asked brian to give me a hug and kiss goodnight and brian said no because robots cant love people
4986114 ecstatic and couldnt keep the smiles off their faces or their eyes off each other
4986115 its an attractive quality to see a man putting time and care into a propertys upkeep
4986116 from the data we have theres no credible evidence that there appears to be any risk
4986117 theres been a few doubters and hopefully ive proved a few wrong
4986118 it doesnt really bother me to be honest i see pre season as a time to get match fit
4986119 it was a very open game and i think both teams wanted to attack like us crewe wanted to get the ball down and play and it was a very entertaining game
4986120 i dont think it means too much at this stage of the season
4986121 its always nice to start well last year we drew our opening game then followed that with a win so we have already improved on that
4986122 we didnt know about that statistic but obviously it is nice to achieve something like that
4986123 we broke a club record for consecutive home wins last season so its nice to be part of something like that
4986124 after last year when we went out of all the competitions early i think it is important we get a decent run this season to go along with a good league season

4986141 we went out with the soldiers and a lot of them helped us because we know them
4986142 i didnt think we had a winner because a lot of people brought big ones and there were many almost as big as this one
4986143 the prize money is fine but we spent quite a lot of money to get it
4986144 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind

4986163 the place that has suffered most is south ossetia which is home to both ethnic ossetians and georgians the latter accounting for about a third of the population
4986164 ossetians fleeing the conflict zone talk of georgian atrocities and the indiscriminate killing of civilians
4986165 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4986166 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4986167 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4986168 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4986169 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault
4986170 many had traveled in their nightclothes on rocky roads through the mountains and gave bloodcurdling accounts of georgian atrocities i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was reduced to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire alisa mamiyeva 26 a teacher in tskhinvali said from the safety of vladikavkaz in north ossetia
4986171 russia failed to back up its claims of georgian atrocities
4986172 coverage in the u s and europe is leaning heavily toward reports on the georgian casualties of russian bombing over the weekend few details are being given about the thousands said to have been killed when georgia attacked tskhinvali the capital of south ossetia on thursday and friday
4986173 the figure of 2 000 people killed is very doubtful our findings so far do not in any way confirm the russian statistics on the contrary they suggest the numbers are exaggerated
4986174 one woman told how a family of four including two children tried to flee from a georgian tank but it fired on their car and they were all burned to death said angela who like all the refugees only gave her first name
4986175 she saw the georgian tanks roll into tskhinvali the soldiers shouting hail saakashvili who is the president of georgia they destroyed the city added inna 33 who said she could not understand how the georgian troops could do that to civilians
4986176 you see your friends home burning and theres nothing you can do you just watch and cry its a genocide inna said an old woman among the refugees said all she had left was the dress she was wearing my house is destroyed she said
4986177 russian peacekeepers osce observers south ossetian troops and the u
4986178 i can just hear mccain barnstorming the country in 08 denouncing russian imperialism and demanding that we stop putin in the caucasus before russian troops cross the bering straits
4986179 in view of americas determination to set up a missile defence shield in europe the military is reviewing all its plans to give washington an adequate response
4986180 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4986181 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4986182 as a community we would expect those to be followed through
4986183 we want to be able to describe the gap and explain why the gap is occurring
4986184 we actually do want to get space into the presidential platform discussion
4986185 we want to continue interfacing with them to have as much commitment as prior to the election
4986186 the interstate 4 corridor is the key to the state and the cape is the eastern end of the corridor
4986187 its an issue you can speak to that will get the attention of tens of thousands of families
4986188 we intend to keep this issue front and center through november
4986189 i would be surprised if thats the last we see of them
4986190 they cant be confused on what they ask the agency to do
4986191 the things one has to do for ones brother but seriously c kkompany is an important film for tusski normally id do nothing to promote our films but this one is for my kid brother
4986192 when he tusshar asked me to make an appearance in the film i agreed then i made an exception and appeared on the reality show with him
4986193 tusshar has a release my cousin gattu abhishek kapoor has directed rock on that too releases aug 29 as tusshars c kkompany
4986194 both my brothers will have to gift me something special for raksha bandhan and the quality of the gift would depend on whose film is a bigger hit
4986195 after several hours of fighting 28 taliban have been killed
4986196 from tomorrow russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
4986197 george bush provokes threatened russia nuking of us in poland

4986200 the emissaries of musharraf are still in contact with the government and as far as we know musharrafs aides are advising him either to resign seeking an assurance for indemnity or try the supreme court
4986201 i invested everything i had in my retirement and now im stuck with a big payment and an apartment thats no good
4986202 none of us want a special session right now on property taxes
4986203 you couldnt get a special session in the florida legislature right now if you paid every one of them 1 000
4986204 theres only so much state government can do lets be honest
4986205 i feel the firefighters have more times than not shown a willingness to work with the city on many issues but this is one request we cannot approve
4986206 gov charlie crist stated many times publicly that his tax reform plan would not affect one firefighter or police officer
4986207 the firefighters bargained in good faith giving up benefits in order to receive a pay increase
4986208 the same hardships that the city is facing are also facing the firefighters and their families
4986209 the firefighters voted to be team players and took a health insurance benefit cut while approving higher health insurance premiums
4986210 one factor could be the seniority of our department staff
4986211 more than 50 percent of our firefighting staff has more than 10 years of services with the city

4986213 if i remember right they still have an annual easter egg roll at the governors mansion so your unwavering confidence in a guy who still believes in the easter bunny is admirable

4986234 we basically knuckled down the weather came in really bad for a couple of days we got stuck on a ridge and there were avalanches all around us it was pretty risky
4986235 by then it was about four in the afternoon we knew we would have to buckle down so we got prepared to stick through another tough night out there
4986236 there was an enormous amount of snow we kept having to dig the tent out it would just keep on getting buried so one of us would get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm everything was soaking wet
4986237 it was pretty scary i was trying to lead the way the other day and a big slab fell down beside me i was really shitting myself then because its a long way to the bottom
4986238 we could see the chopper but it was looking in the wrong section and youre just thinking ohhh theyre not going to find us were too small its too white our tent is too white our tent is too buried and then obviously when they called off the search due to the weather you think the weather is just not going to break its been like this for days and days
4986239 every time the chopper goes away and looks somewhere else youre thinking come on come on just see us
4986240 we were fine we could have lasted a few more days without too much trouble except for the boredom
4986241 we heard it fly over the back of the ridge as soon as we heard it we had a yellow flag out ready to wave it was hovering above the ridge and we were waving frantically but it couldnt see us and then the weather came in again we buckled back down again and then as soon the weather cleared we jumped back up finally it the helicopter came close enough for visibility it was such a relief to see it waving back to us
4986242 there were times it was kind of scary i have to say but somehow i knew we were going to be all right
4986243 they did the right thing they stayed put and dug themselves a snow cave and kept each other warm
4986244 what we think of as todays major drugs almost all entered american culture in the mid 19th century and all became hugely popular by the end of it

4986253 white house has struck a neutral tone on a man long regarded as a key ally in the us led war on terror saying that the impeachment threat was an internal matter
4986254 about 20 charges including gross misconduct and violation of the constitution
4986255 the constitutional role of the army is what it is a nonpolitical one
4986256 and the position of the army in all this has emerged with perfect clarity
4986257 they havent come this far in order to turn back
4986258 musharraf played the apr s moi le d luge to perfection in washington
4986259 i have no doubt that zardari would if necessary play on americas fears of an islamist takeover and that it would still work

4986267 almost 3 000 driving under the influence arrests were made in that time
4986268 these are administrative hearings that dont affect the criminal case
4986269 its still important and were going to follow through to see if the officers who didnt show up had a reason for doing so
4986270 if an officer didnt appear on three or five cases a year and shes making 100 no 1 from a department standpoint thats still unacceptable
4986271 we expect our officers to appear any time theyre subpoenaed to court
4986272 but things do happen officers get sick kids get sick the car wont start the same thing that happens to everyone else happens to our officers
4986273 i just think those figures are outrageous i just cant believe the police officers would not show up and would risk these people getting their driving licenses back and being a threat to our citizens
4986274 youve got people out there whove been drinking and driving and that dmv hearing is one that can put their licenses back in their hands
4986275 and you may not be able to take it away again until they go to trial
4986276 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4986277 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4986278 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault
4986279 any time something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up
4986280 everything there is to know about me has been in the media ad nauseam
4986281 i lost the election in 2004 thanks to a certain group of people in the south end of the county
4986282 madonna detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother it showed a side of her that made her very human
4986283 but i think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him
4986284 no way for me to get a feel for the major players
4986285 mary hucks was my only daughter and lived a beautiful life
4986286 but to the law enforcement officers it was just a girl murdered on the beach i feel so utterly helpless
4986287 the person that was killed was my father in law
4986288 i remember i was feeling sickly that day from the terrible nausea you get when youre pregnant
4986289 i remember seeing a line of headlights out the window
4986290 it looked all decorated up with venetian blinds and things
4986291 i started reading this stuff and one of the names stuck out
4986292 i have give my soul to god and i going to write and tell the truth about everything from the time i meet george wolfork jr
4986293 he got some but he had a very hard time
4986294 they scuffle all around but his pal got some too
4986295 this file had been taken apart for the past six decades and that statement was still in it
4986296 im not going to tell a lie on george or anyone else
4986297 im the man that shot him but i sorry i did it
4986298 i dont know why he would want to say he was the shooter and then lie about one of the assailants in the 1948 murder
4986299 i asks george to tell why that he didnt want to go to daytonie
4986300 if there is anything else i can do let me know before i die monday
4986301 i was convinced over the years that case had been wrote off way back then based on my recollection it was a foregone conclusion that they did it
4986302 would i be able to take this into a court of law no
4986303 but i think this is as close as were going to get and for the families they have been wondering what happened to their loved ones for 60 years
4986304 i thought is this an april fools type of thing
4986305 it could have relieved my aunt mary of all the agony she lived through
4986306 it is my personal feeling at this time that we can not get any nearer to a solution of that crime until the execution date of the starke criminals is set
4986307 we know that one of them was present in ormond beach that night and we have two other negroes under surveillance of their local police departments so that when george wolfork confesses as he said he will do before he is executed we can pick the others up at once
4986308 your presence is requested for the departing of our friends
4986309 i am thru sic on quincy and have gone on a hot lead to south louisiana that may clear up the ormond beach case
4986310 i am sending it to you not that i am thru sic with it but for safe keeping
4986311 for i think of the case at least once a day and i have sworn an oath to do my utmost to complete it when i can
4986312 it gives them a feel for what they need to work on for the regular season
4986313 weve got the chairs weve got the cooler were under a tent
4986314 today gets us used to being out here all day on saturday
4986315 sorry for the delay but my car met with an accident the bombay traffic surely sucks
4986316 i love to show them off i want people to know this is not just something you get in jail that you dont have to be a criminal to get a tattoo
4986317 theres a lot of people who do come out without tattoos that are curious we offer them real cool temporary tattoos and sometimes they come back the next year with real ones
4986318 they require special maintenance and care and some of these species can be dangerous
4986319 officers found the store open for business and nistico exhibiting reptiles with an expired permit
4986320 the alligator was caged in a manner giving the public easy access
4986321 now they bring up this u s sugar deal its very confusing to the public and to elected officials
4986322 florida rock has a long term lease with u s sugar
4986323 as far as we are concerned the buyout doesnt affect it at all
4986324 it would have been reckless for us to talk about it beforehand
4986325 this isnt a race dont go at it too hard we had someone rupture an eardrum last time

4986329 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4986330 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms
4986331 anwar should also be doing the same thing instead of just giving ceramah everywhere to prove his innocence
4986332 it is to demonstrate that he was telling the truth i congratulate him for his courage
4986333 if i were anwar the next thing ill do is to go to the mosque and prove my innocence the legal way is not enough
4986334 ive done this for god and i took my oath in the house of god that i was humiliated and sodomised by anwar ibrahim and i do not wish to lie to the world as he has done
4986335 if you are to write on religion then you are supposed to touch on matters pertaining to questions on rituals adherence to god followers and anything related to your divine mission
4986336 im in no way confident we werent that good last week and managed to scrape the win whats going to happen without robsons driving runs and play
4986337 robson failed a fitness test no other reason if he were fit naka would be on the bench
4986338 dundee united will have a point to prove after hamilton taught them a lesson or two in their previous game
4986339 cant believe brown is playing instead of robson i think robson was the best player from january onwards last year
4986340 mcdonald wont be a one season wonder at celtic he wasnt a one season wonder at motherwell
4986341 maloney would be a good signing for celtic but would he get a game
4986342 its a big laugh the wages these guys get its not even on the radar for us
4986343 ive brought kovacevic and kenneth in as we were abysmal at the back against hamilton prince has not been at his best and i thought we needed more of a goal threat in midfield david robertson will give us that
4986344 i understand that mikele silvestre would be wanting around 60 000 per week so the suggestion that he might join celtic on loan from man united is not a goer theres more truth in the shaun maloney story as the possibility of bringing him back from aston villa is being discussed by celtic

4986353 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost
4986354 we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
4986355 im sure theyre only here to get a vacation and dont really want fans coming and attacking them excpessailly you guys all you be doing is omj its you its really you ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i looooooooove you im serious one day youre gonna kill them with your screaming it already broke part of my eardrum

4986386 having added strength up front is a situation i really enjoy
4986387 ideally i like to operate with four experienced strikers as we did when we won the treble when we had andy cole dwight yorke teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer
4986388 it was an admirable strength to have when it came to the end of the season and we were competing on three fronts with key games coming at us thick and fast
4986389 we are speaking to southampton and we have agreed a deal with them
4986390 hes got good experience but is also a young lad with good legs
4986391 you need that in the premier league but we will see because the deal is not finalised yet
4986392 we also need to get a bit more premier league experience in and we have been working hard to do that
4986393 we are now entering one of the most intense political periods that we have ever seen
4986394 we are jamming in a lot of major events the selection of each candidates vice president their national conventions the debates and election day all in an almost 10 week period
4986395 there are ups and downs with a slight advantage to obama
4986396 if anybody had asked us a couple of months ago whether or not we would like to be where we are today which from what we can tell is a pretty even race we would have been pretty thrilled
4986397 we are now heavy after 25 millimetres of rain overnight
4986398 we are speaking to southampton and we have agreed a deal with them
4986399 hes got good experience but is also a young lad with good legs
4986400 you need that in the premier league but we will see because the deal is not finalised yet
4986401 padraig has done ireland so proud again its great what hes done in the past month
4986402 i saw almost all the open and couldnt believe that shot he played on the 17th it was just inspirational and then he got over a bad round at oakland hills to win the us pga
4986403 for my part i can still win tournaments it was proved last season with marco fu and dominic dale winning from out of the top 16 i even have another world title in me
4986404 this couldnt have happened to her so close to the finish line and just to be like that it must have been horrific for her out there
4986405 i may have to say no actually i was last
4986406 so when it happened on kilometer 39 with two miles to go i thought for sure i was done i thought there was no way i never felt pain like that running in my whole life i dont understand what happened i was drinking every station i was taking three gels i dont understand why i got such bad cramps
4986407 when i was sitting there looking at the stadium and i just couldnt move because it was just pulling so strong i didnt think i was going to finish the race
4986408 i said to myself even if it takes me a half an hour i just have to give myself a chance to finish
4986409 that was probably the most magical moment of my whole olympics
4986410 i went through that gate knowing that whatever happens i have only one lap to go and i will finish this race that i think was the first time that i really believed i was going to finish
4986411 the only point that i actually believe is true in this post
4986412 geesh they spent all that money designing and studying those projects for nothing
4986413 the decision would be taken as the situation in the region is stabilised

4986416 prince charles must prove his claim that gm crops could cause a global environmental disaster environment minister phil woolas has challenged
4986417 if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
4986418 then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and talked with me saying to me come i will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters
4986419 o you who dwell by many waters abundant in treasures your end has come the measure of your covetousness
4986420 with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth were made drink with the wine of her fornication
4986421 babylon was a golden cup in the lords hand that made all the earth drunk the nations drank her wine therefore the nations are deranged
4986422 so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness
4986423 the area has an ice base and the snow sometimes isnt stable

4986444 everyone at uconn would like to wish elena the best of luck
4986445 shes so good former uconn all american kara wolters said
4986446 what a waste its the most bizarre thing ive ever heard to have an opportunity like that to play obviously at the best college womens program in the world and she threw it away
4986447 geno said i thought i had seen it all at connecticut until this wolters said
4986448 its like an engaged couple youre glad they broke up before they got married and had to have a divorce better now than to have her affect the team negatively and be like a cancer to the team because shes whacked its probably a good thing in a way because that would have just been all things bad if she came and then started causing trouble went crazy and then just affected the team so maybe its for the best that if shes really not into it that she doesnt come at all

4986451 the speed with which the obama campaign can respond to allegations has been quite impressive for example

4986454 i would not willingly support any move to have government interference in tv rights which may control packer because as i have said many times before it would inevitably bring control of the fees that may be paid

4986456 those who claim recent events may have rectified the trouble may well be right in the short term but in 10 20 years it would certainly return and be a bogey once more and i think our responsibility is to provide now against such a contingency
4986457 half a lemniscate a lemniscate half a lemniscate the other way
4986458 we are very confident about the way we are playing
4986459 we are developing a group of young players and the senior guys are doing a great job
4986460 we just need to to work hard and make sure that we do things right
4986461 the one day game is a different ball game altogether and the indians pose a very different challenge
4986462 we just have to make sure that we get our game plan right
4986463 the knock in colombo has given me a lot of confidence and i hope i can continue this form
4986464 but i had also prepared well before coming here and am aware that the conditions in dambulla are quite different from those in colombo
4986465 its important we play according to the conditions and not to peoples expectations
4986466 i want someone to play with i dont want to play by myself i want to play with a grown up
4986467 as long as everything is exactly the way i want it im flexible
4986468 the huge list of activities includes a day at the melbourne show a trip to the melbourne zoo and the eureka skydeck
4986469 evs youth centre will turn into a chill out zone for a day with a portable digital dome theatre taking up evs young people will be able to lay down eat pizza and watch films on the roof of the big blow up cosmodome
4986470 a visit to the warrook cattle farm and koala conservation centre at phillip island is also on the cards as well a trip to the cinemas and a game of laser strike will keep young people on their toes and having a great time
4986471 make sure you book soon as places will fill up quickly dont miss out on one of the best holiday experiences this year
4986472 i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part
4986473 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4986474 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of the constitution
4986475 this nomination should be based on the criteria on a proven record of strictly adhering to the constitution and not legislating from the bench
4986476 weve got to drill now weve got to drill here
4986477 i know there are some here in cal eee fornia that disagree with that position
4986478 for gay partners to visit each other in the hospital i dont think limits my core beliefs about what marriage is
4986479 the harmful teacher is one of bad temperament of little pure vision great in dogmatism he holds his own view as highest praises himself and denigrates others
4986480 a fish in front of a person is rotting and is tightly wrapped with kusha grass if that package is not moved for a long time the kusha itself also becomes like that like that kusha grass by following the sinful teacher you will always become like him
4986481 as the chief among the obstructors bar du gcod pa of all virtuous qualities is the sinful teacher one should abandon being associated with him speaking with him or even being touched by his shadow
4986482 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis yeah i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but through deeds the expectations that god has for us
4986483 i want someone to play with i dont want to play by myself i want to play with a grown up
4986484 as long as everything is exactly the way i want it im flexible
4986485 one of the best three films i have ever seen

4986489 the area has an ice base and the snow sometimes isnt stable

4986493 an offshore yuan market in keeping with the process of the currencys internationalisation
4986494 no untoward incidents took place the situation is tense but under control
4986495 if police continue to use excessive force then it will be difficult for people like me to continue in parliament
4986496 the indo us nuclear deal is important for indias energy security and i think swiss government will most likely support the waiver for new delhi at the nsg meet
4986497 the nuclear deal is good for india and it should be allowed to go through
4986498 it is a decision that has to be taken by the government the parliament has no role to play in it but i am confident that the government will take a favourable stand on the issue
4986499 expressing our concern and most forceful complaint against this decision
4986500 has no scientific proof to make a decision that will harm mexico enormously
4986501 to be very honesty nothing i heard yesterday has allayed our concerns it was an interesting meeting an active meeting
4986502 it went for a while worried players asked many questions to the out numbered icc representatives who arrived from a security assessment in pakistan in an effort to convince the side to travel but we still not totally convinced about the security to our players

4986507 beyond all these things put on love which is the perfect bond of
4986508 things like that i think back to thats why when i saw my family i started crying my mother started crying and my sisters started crying
4986509 did u go to school with eddie macguire its a simple yes or no question
4986510 we are listing that he abused cocaine and thats what resulted in the cocaine toxicity
4986511 he just couldnt hed gone at the time of his death four or five days without doing anything and if hed done anything it would have been so minimal
4986512 he was too weak from the emphysema to do anything hed go in the studio for a couple of minutes and play a couple of bars and say he had to go lay down
4986513 who daddy was was the legend was the icon was the major contributor to the music industry not what this report says
4986514 my experience man with drugs i cant say that im proud that i did drugs but im glad im still alive to convey how i came through
4986515 im a good example that you can go to the bottom i used to pray god if you let me get three days clean i will never look back but i never did get to three days you know why because i would lie to myself and then only when i went to jail man did i get those three days and man i havent looked back since then
4986516 so when i am a fish i will listen and
4986517 no you are never going to be a fish you must listen and obey now as a little girl
4986518 marina pepper describes for male police officers to touch her in a way that in any other circumstances would have had her

4986521 anything made or adapted for use for causing injury to persons

4986530 and it was a few words with john benton harris that set my mind wandering after a quotation from walker evans
4986531 valid photography like humor seems to be too serious a matter to talk about seriously if in a note it cant be defined weightily what it is not can be stated with the utmost finality it is not the image of secretary dulles descending from a plane it is not cute cats nor touchdowns nor nudes motherhood arrangements of manufacturers products under no circumstances is it anything ever anywhere near a beach in short it is not a lie a clich somebody elses idea it is prime vision combined with quality of feeling no less

4986542 i am where i am today because i have earned it
4986543 i like meritocracy and one of the things that appeals to me about australia is its egalitarian culture the fact that you create your future you shape it and youre accountable for it
4986544 all i knew was that i was going to have a project role
4986545 i phoned them up and said if the job is no longer there just tell me they said if you knew anything about our model you would know that this is an opportunity for us it crystallised my understanding of the low cost model sure enough while british airways felt the pinch and retreated from gatwick airport easyjet went in there and stole the march
4986546 there is no hub and spoke we fly point to point so we can add or subtract flights easily the business is much more resilient
4986547 we are talking about five bases over the next seven years 30 aircraft
4986548 exhausting the network by visiting every destination we had a couple of times each
4986549 i was intrigued by the macquarie model and wanted to know more about it
4986550 the role helped me see the coin from the other side having worked for an airline i then got to see how an airport works
4986551 the sydney catchment is obviously very attractive but we need to be true to our low cost model
4986552 we are a very efficient user of airport infrastructure and wed like to see us being rewarded for that
4986553 it reminds me of when easyjet started up and revolutionised things like paperless tickets and booking on the internet while there was some resistance to begin with it brought about a new way of doing things
4986554 what we are doing here is bringing the low cost revolution to australia but to do that it is really important that we are clear about what we are offering the 45 minute cut off time for check in is how we make sure we can deliver that service on time and at the lowest possible cost people need to understand that and i think increasingly they do

4986574 aber warum tun sich die schatten nicht zusammen gegen den einen warum k nnen schatten nicht schatten bek mpfen
4986575 ich habe diese dem tigungen satt ich will diese bestie im staub sehen
4986576 unsere k nig geht auf geistreisen und die krieger planen und planen seit tagen haben die den auftrag mir eine kampfstrategie vorzulegen muss ich das auch noch selbst erledigen
4986577 es ist doch erst 5 tage her seit sie den kriegszustand ausgerufen haben und die krieger wollen auch keinen fehler machen
4986578 und ich habe das gef hl dass die hoheit dem volk und den kriegern nicht alles erz hlt hat was sie wei
4986579 was meinst du damit was willst du mir damit sagen
4986580 ich wei gar nichts ich habe nichts gesagt ich bin nur da um euer leben zu sch tzen
4986581 es war nur ein gef hl wir sind alle verunsichert und wundern uns woher sie die sicherheit nehmen und so zuversichtlich sind dass wir den kampf gegen den schatten gewinnen mein gef hl sagt mir und wohl auch weil ich volles vertrauen in euch habe dass diese zuversicht einen grund haben muss
4986582 ich mag amazonen die die balance zwischen ihren emotionen und ihrer ratio gefunden haben das sind denkende und gute amazonen
4986583 nur dieser eine gr enwahnsinnige popanz tanzt da aus der reihe und wird gef hrlich gef hrlich f r alle existierenden welten und schon die sagen l ngst untergegangener v lker berichten davon dass immer wieder einer aus der unterwelt besiegt wurde weil er das kosmische gef ge st ren wollte deswegen bin ich mir so sicher weil wir die wiederholung der geschichte sind
4986584 du sollst eine der wenigen sein die etwas mehr wissen d rfen
4986585 es ist jetzt schon einige winter her da ist hier eine matrona verschwunden niemand der amazonen konnte sich erkl ren warum und wohin und es wurde lange getrauert tats chlich aber wurde sie von der k nigin und mir mit einem gef hrlichen auftrag betraut wir hatten auf unseren reisen eine neue und sehr gef hrliche welt entdeckt auf dieser welt so scheint es gibt es einen zugang zur der unterwelt der haljo diese matrona hat von uns den auftrag sich auf dieser welt anzusiedeln und f r uns die unterwelt zu erkundigen wir haben den auftrag nach dem germanischen kriegsgott teiwaz benannt die mission musste geheim bleiben weil diese nachrichten wohl eine panik ausgel st h tte oder dumme helden h tten sich auf den weg zu dieser welt gemacht und h tten dann das leben unserer schwester dort noch gef hrlicher gemacht als es ohnehin schon ist
4986586 wir haben eine schwester die wir alle f r tot halten und die f r uns ihr leben riskiert
4986587 ja psssst und wenn dir an ihrem leben etwas liegt dann bleibt sie auch tot jedenfalls vorl ufig noch
4986588 von ihr wissen wir dass die schatten immer auf der seite der menschen waren wenn sie von der unterwelt bedroht wurden insofern war die reise der k nigin in den geist der schattenfrau wichtig wir haben einen beweis daf r wir wissen auch dass die haljo von hel regiert wird hel ist die toteng ttin und ist die tochter von loki dem feuerbringer und der riesin angrboda die kummerbereiterin man wei noch nicht genau ob sie wirklich g ttin oder ob sie eine riesin ist ihre haut ist zur einer h lfte von normaler farbe zur anderen blau schwarz was bedeutet dass sie halb tot und halb lebendig ist zusammen mit ihren beiden geschwistern dem fenriswolf und der midgardschlange wurde sie von den asen nach asgard gebracht da die g tter sich vor den kindern lokis f rchteten w hrend der fenriswolf an die kette gleipnir gebunden und die midgardschlange von odin ins meer geworfen wurde verbannte man hel aus asgard woraufhin sie nach norden ging wo sie ihr eigenes reich gr ndete dort holt sie all diejenigen zu sich die eines nat rlichen todes sterben w hrend die im kampf gestorbenen nach walhall an odins tafel gelangen es gibt also noch viele andere reiche in dieser unterwelt dort die es zu erforschen gilt
4986589 das ist das was wir bisher wissen wir wissen nicht warum und wieso thor zu einem b sen schatten wurde ob er in dieser haljo etwas entdeckt hat oder ob er ausgesto en wurde wir wissen es nicht kamaria die schattenfrau hat uns den weg aufgezeigt wie wir ihn unsch dlich machen k nnen jetzt will ich endlich einen plan haben eine strategie
4986590 sie hat wohl gelauscht jetzt werde ich sie t ten m ssen
4986591 wirf sie in das bad dahinten damit sie wieder zu sich kommt
4986592 h ngen wir sie zum trocknen in der taverne auf so ein bis zwei tage
4986593 werden wir wirklich erfolg haben wir m ssen einfach schon allein um zu verhindern dass die k nigin sich nochmals auf eine vereinigung mit kamaria einl sst das darf nicht noch mal passieren ich traue diesem wesen nicht
4986594 beruhige dich schwester unsere stunde wird kommen und dann werden wir ihm zeigen das er mit uns nicht alles machen kann
4986595 aber was kommt danach ist es dann wirklich erledigt wenn wir diesen einen schatten besiegt haben kommt da noch irgendwas gibt es vielleicht noch irgendwas was uns die hoheiten verheimlichen
4986596 ich hoffe wir werden bei unserem besuch im elfenland vorw rtskommen und ich hoffe wir werden wenn wir zur ck sind eine gute strategie und einen plan der richterin vorlegen k nnen
4986597 die begegnung gestern mit kamaria und ihr vorschlag haben mich heute nacht lange besch ftigt ich tr umte von einem ort und in dem traum nannte ich den ort arach ich sah sehr viele schatten um diesen ort herum und alle schienen sie irgendwie aufgeregt besorgt ich hatte das gef hl sie f rchteten sich vor drough da war noch mehr ich sah tief unter der erde verborgen wesen wie ich sie noch nie gesehen habe halb licht und halb schatten liebliche wesen und d monen sie stritten sich und immer mehr von den wesen l sten sich aus dem pulk und versammelten sich um ein gro es schwarzes wesen es war drough und er stand da mit ausgebreiteten armen
4986598 er sammelt seine armeen er wird von tag zu tag m chtiger
4986599 wenn wir das auserw hlte volk sind und alle anzeichen sprechen daf r dann m ssen wir auf den vorschlag von kamaria eingehen du musst die krieger auf diesen plan einschw ren sie h ren auf dich du bist der warlord ihr kriegsherr mich verehren sie und w rden alles f r mich geben aber hierbei
4986600 ich habe gestern in die gesichter der krieger geschaut diese stolzen amazonen w rden es nicht zulassen dass ihre k nigin vor irgendeinem wesen einen kniefall macht
4986601 du wei t doch ganz genau dass ich schon l ngst den vorschlag von kamaria durchdacht habe wir beide stehen zueinander und nichts nicht die verr ckteste aktion wird uns beide auseinender dividieren wir werden drough stoppen warten wir ab was die krieger an pl nen mitbringen

4986628 recently a polar bear having arrived in northern iceland on ice that had broken away from the shores of greenland was killed by icelandic law enforcement personnel i was in that part of the country at the time and was troubled by the haste with which this violent action was carried out it was explained to me that it was a safety issue however i recall another greenland polar bear being killed in iceland in 1993 just off shore at that time due to public outrage government officials promised that in future they would ensure that stranded bears were tranquilised and relocated apparently no thorough efforts were made to plan for that sort of humane approach on this recent visit to iceland i suggested to some of the friends i have there that their society ought to perhaps get ready with a workable plan as to what to do in the future because there would likely be a lot more polar bears drifting across from greenland on chunks of ice all of them said that it was very unlikely that it only happens once every 10 or 15 years well i have just heard that another one has shown up in iceland in the last two days i hope the government there will use more common sense and decency in handling this bear and all those bears who due to the melting ice cap in greenland will be ending up in iceland it might not be a bad idea for british norwegian russian canadian us and danish authorities to think this eventuality through as well as refugees be they people or bears do not distinguish between borders and only want to be safe as much importance should be given to the fate of these and other animals affected by climate change as is being given by the above named countries to who owns the north pole

4986681 i know youre an adult but i still worry about you sometimes
4986682 you know what would be interesting i could pretend to be a street kid and ask people for money it would be a sort of thought experiment feeling what it would be like to be homeless and see how people treat you when you sit in harvard square and ask for change

4986698 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4986699 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4986777 the firefighter who took us down kept saying do not look down and i kept saying why and were stepping over people and you know you can feel when youre stepping over people
4986778 abdo and i went into no 7 activated oem placed calls to ems citywide rcc to tell them we were there and we were activated
4986779 we began to log onto the terminals as well as inform the citywide dispatch supervisor that we were activating oem at this time and operations were to begin
4986780 they were telling us that we had a plane hit us in the pentagon and we now realized we were under attack wtc 7 could have been a target it could have been a serious target
4986781 with a very confused look he said who told you that

4986791 its very difficult to explain the way i feel right now it will take a few days before i realize im olympic champion
4986792 but this is for sure the biggest moment in my career in my life i will never forget this moment
4986793 its disgusting what people do and what they throw away
4986794 in the past weve found dirty nappies bottles of urine and needles which we presume have been used for drugs
4986795 this is the kind of thing we usually pick up
4986796 but we will come back in a fortnight and do exactly the same again the worst bit of the job is when you get people winding down their car or van windows and just deliberately throwing stuff on the ground right in front of you as they pass
4986797 ive found a dead animal in a bag a folding metal chair anda bit of bumper trim were going to have to take the van to pick up those
4986798 councils are already coming under increasing pressure to deal with littering and some of the legislation is confusing registered keepers can be prosecuted for speeding unless details of an alternative offender are given so why not for littering

4986818 georgians were asking him to say he was georgian but he said no i am ossetian so they killed him
4986819 used the footage of tskhinvali which was literally ruined as a result of georgias attacks to make reports about the situation in the town of gori which the russian aviation supposedly bombed
4986820 what became the picture that mike jeremy of itn pegged one of the key images of the war in the former yugoslavia qtd in deichmann p 170 was in fact presented as to the western world as something it was not a concentration camp the focus was on fikret alic whos protruding rib cage behind a fence conjured up images of nazi death camps this death camp was a crude sick lie and fikret alic who survived the war was disturbed about the use of his image
4986821 we have a lock down situation we have cameras but the question we had to answer is what if somebody gets in what are we going to do
4986822 obviously we have been concentrating on the game and since friday our minds have been on the game
4986823 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it i dont have any comment to make on it
4986824 we actually opted for giovani dos santos because we thought that his speed would be something that would trouble middlesbrough
4986825 however as middlesbrough tired in the game we thought it might be the right moment in the game to throw on berbatov
4986826 we have lost one forward robbie keane lets just see if were capable of adding to the squad in one or two areas putting an end to any purchases and then seeing how we can get everyone to play as a team and as an efficient unit

4986832 these complications were associated with swelling of neck and throat tissue which resulted in compression of the airway and or neurological structures in the neck
4986833 either use approved alternative treatments or consider enrolling as investigators in approved clinical studies
4986834 treatments needed included respiratory support with intubation anti inflammatory medication tracheotomy and most commonly second surgeries to drain the surgical site
4986835 most likely is related to a combination of improved diagnostic techniques heightened awareness increased chance of positive outcome with current techniques and potentially most important overuse of young throwing arms
4986836 its great that the surgery is successful but prevention of the injury should be the goal
4986837 kids should be urged to rest and be careful about saving their arms
4986838 this should be a wake up call to parents and coaches that specialization in baseball where kids dont get adequate time off is very dangerous
4986839 possible protective effect that seems to prevent the occurrence of late ulnar nerve symptoms
4986840 we attribute this improvement primarily to greater experience in surgical technique and rehabilitation
4986841 based on biomechanical measurements and calculations of the forces generated in the throwing elbow one would expect ucl failure to occur even more frequently than is currently encountered
4986842 this study found a very high failure rate in patients 40 years and younger with high activity levels in acl dependent sports like tennis basketball soccer and downhill skiing
4986843 however this study definitely raises questions about the validity of using cadaver tissue in this patient subgroup
4986844 for a young patient who is very active it may not be the right choice

4986847 it may be the beginning of an entirely new era for oral anticoagulants that do not require dose adjustment titration
4986848 that certainly would represent a marked change in clinical practice
4986849 which may be due in part to the difference in definitions of bleeding
4986850 the natural history of anterior cruciate ligaments treated non operatively is that patients go on to develop cartilage damage
4986851 it depends on how much cartilage damage he sustained to his knee by waiting but probably not
4986852 anyone who has an acl reconstruction never has a normal knee if you ask those patients theyre not the same
4986853 indeed we are already observing that growth in mobile telephony has provided a reliable form of communication to rural communities thereby enabling our farmers to market their produce

4986866 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4986867 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4986868 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4986869 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4986870 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4986871 god knows when i wasnt my usual self this morning you cant ask for more than a world record ill have a lie in in the morning ive got 24 hours to recover well have a tough ride against the danes but if we put in another ride like that well have them

4986879 this town is very good that way with charity events
4986880 its so different from what i remember after the vietnam war
4986881 i started thinking about it looking over at ground zero
4986882 i have a lot of friends and family in the military and i could see how much it meant for them
4986883 it was a good experience a good way to get in a run with other people
4986884 its a good way to give attention to the people not the politics
4986885 salvou os outros a si mesmo se salve se jesus cristo era de fato filho de deus
4986886 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4986887 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4986888 all the government offices and services were on alert during the ceremony
4986889 the security plan required thousands of security personnel including more than 2 000 women police workers
4986890 the pilgrims were aware that these measures were for their safety and to protect them from terrorist attacks
4986891 this was the most successful ceremony since the fall of the saddam hussein regime because we did not face any problems as we marched for seven days to reach karbala
4986892 the security measures were in our interest as several pilgrims were attacked while on their way to karbala from baghdad
4986893 i had no fear this year the pilgrimage was successful
4986894 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4986895 mugabe is trying to stick it out in a very specific way for a graceful exit
4986896 sooner or later our president is going to say or do something that goes too far and then it will start
4986897 what happened here in the last week certainly came as a shock not only to georgia but to a lot of others as well
4986898 a lot of people will as a result of this want to build a closer relationship with their western partners as quickly as possible
4986899 i would like to believe it will be russia because we are fraternal nations and have to support each other
4986900 russia will not disappear tomorrow as well as in a century or two
4986901 we will always wake up and it will be there not canada
4986902 the assumption of the post 1991 settlement has been that the old russia is in the past that it is not a country that invades its neighbors
4986903 basically the entire european security architecture is based on this premise
4986904 theres an immediate need to bring all parties to a common consensus to take the country forward
4986905 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal
4986906 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4986907 prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
4986908 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
4986909 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them

4986912 the emissaries of musharraf are still in contact with the government and as far as we know musharrafs aides are advising him either to resign seeking an assurance for indemnity or try the supreme court
4986913 theres no question heath ledgers performance has made cinematic history its one of the most important or memorable villains ever
4986914 that added to it but i think you have to look at a film in its entirety its the marvelous job the filmmakers and the actors did
4986915 in a very real sense ive been motivated my entire life with surroticas concepts beginning from my childhood
4986916 having been reared in a european background my parents were deeply steeped in the arts music theatre dance and photography virtually all art forms
4986917 theres a definite influence in nearly all the fashion lines being unveiled for this fall
4986918 but its a different level of taste than what we saw 25 years ago its not as over the top as what we had during 80s and its clear to see designers have taken a softer approach
4986919 this years glamorama event is extremely special as it marks our 10th anniversary supporting the art institute of chicago
4986920 were proud to partner with the art institute in making the arts more accessible to our local communities each and every day
4986921 glamorama 2008 is taking all the fashions that were considered so totally awesome and giving them a modern twist
4986922 weve already seen some of this starting in the previous season with names like mary kate and ashley olsen wearing headbands now youre going to see them everywhere
4986923 everyone in the world has faith all you have to do is turn your faith loose
4986924 come to jesus you do not have to obey anyone you do not have to give up anything just come to him and believe in him as savior
4986925 this weeks google outages left several google apps admins in the lurch and many of them are

4986931 la decisi n tomada por el estado es adecuada considerando la negativa por parte de yale para devolver un patrimonio que inclusive la national geographic ha reconocido como peruano
4986932 was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody laugh
4986933 having some health issues but always said to me every morning that he was good
4986934 we dont have anybody else to turn to but god
4986935 we have to turn these problems over to god and not to man
4986936 immediately the owners came out and changed the gas prices they brought it down we had marvellous success down in st louis missouri
4986937 we believe not just in prayer because we believe that faith without works is dead so weve encouraged people to car pool more and organise their days more because its a combination of faith with these other factors
4986938 we want freedom indians go home and kashmir is ours
4986939 i started looking at the so called organic bath and skin care products on the market and quickly discovered that most products that claim to be organic and natural still contain many chemicals including known toxic synthetics already banned in europe i didnt want that for my family thus organically happy was born to provide a venue for safe and sustainable ingredients to an enlightened market
4986940 most of our products are good enough to eat your skin absorbs up to 60 of the substances you put on it and they should be pure natural and chemical free as well as extremely effective
4986941 in a very real sense ive been motivated my entire life with surroticas concepts beginning from my childhood
4986942 having been reared in a european background my parents were deeply steeped in the arts music theatre dance and photography virtually all art forms
4986943 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
4986944 there is now a major awareness on health in the industry and through cfdas continued programs there had been a real coming together with an emphasis on health as beauty
4986945 the canal is not going to be the panacea for new york but it is part of the equation for the upstate economy
4986946 on our first trip in 1990 the locks were strictly commercial and it was really rough
4986947 some people would buy big bales of hay and tie them to the side of their boats to keep the boat from being swallowed up by the big holes in the canal wall
4986948 but it has improved considerably now there are barbecues picnic tables theres tie ups i cant believe how beautiful it is
4986949 we all know the history and significance of the erie canal but its really no longer a transportation facility
4986950 new yorks port is no longer dependent on the river system at all and you can only really justify public investment going forward not because something has a history
4986951 why should the people of new york subsidize yacht owners
4986952 obviously its important to the state for tourism and we dont want to see anything happen to the canal
4986953 but we dont think it should be maintained with money from thruway tolls
4986954 saya agak kecewa karena pt askes tidak transparan dan tidak accountable dalam menjalankan manajemen askeskin karena itu saya tidak mau dana askeskin 2008 ini untuk nyaur utang membayar utang program askeskin tahun 2007 untuk program askeskin tahun 2007 kita batasi sampai desember dana tahun 2008 adalah untuk program askeskin 2008 saya tidak mau dana tahun 2008 ini terengah engah untuk membayar miss manajemen tahun 2007

4986959 death is just so cold and seems so unpleasant we must call it something else so it wont be as scary a prospect as before i vote that it should be called crossing over moving on or passing away all of which have a much more hopeful ring to them than being decomposed by bacteria or becoming a feast for worms those who are in favor say aye

4986963 on average the group of taxes that fund the stadium have grown by 3 to 4 percent annually far above the 1 percent the state is counting on said ryan kitchell director of the states office of management and budget
4986964 were watching the revenues closely but we are still confident based on the conservative growth assumptions for the finance plan
4986965 i was thinking not to blow the lead i was really nervous
4986966 the last two years a lot of them didnt even have an email address
4986967 they werent even putting themselves in front of national media
4986968 the first year we lost a lot of money a lot
4986969 last year we made a small profit of about 3000 but then i got a final bill from someone and that went too
4986970 img is all about mak ing money the thing is though weve got the wins on the board up here in queensland weve shown our face and our cards and weve demonstrated that we know what were about
4986971 we need to take steps to demonstrate to them the return on their investment
4986972 previously weve tried to get designers to tell us what theyve actually achieved from being associated with the festival in terms of actual flow on sales but theyve never been willing to give us that information
4986973 well be doing exit interviews after the shows and with customers in their stores
4986974 i am absolutely gob smacked at how well the city is embracing the fes tival
4986975 the opening and closing events sold out straight away weve sold out seven or so shows all up now were thinking we might have to go to standing room only for some of them
4986976 its been a hard two years people were a little more reticent in the beginning to support us
4986977 now i think they have more of an understanding of what were about
4986978 theres a luxury attached to it and its not parochial theyve timed it really well its the per fect platform to showcase spring summer they have been smart about that too
4986979 thats where i think well get a lot of traffic all the local women will love to see themselves posted on our website at the parties and shows
4986980 i love the brisbane festival because of the audience participation and the goodwill
4986981 people really seem to enjoy themselves its a very positive experience actu ally you get a great vibe that you dont get in sydney
4986982 brisbane consumers are very loyal to their local designers its so much nicer than some of the fashion shows down here
4986983 before i was a naive 27 year old qut graduate who didnt really know how to do anything but on the back of that first festival i got invited to show at the melbourne festival and then we also did sydney and australian fashion weeks
4986984 both cities have a different way of life and a different style sydney is more about the pop culture and the hype brisbane is more quirkier edgier avant garde
4986985 therell be some big changes in 2009 itll have been three years with the current format and the current sponsors
4986986 weve had the chance to get to know them theyve got to know us well really sit back and analyse whats worked what hasnt what we can do better if its been a good marriage
4986987 better to not have a deal than to have a bad deal
4986988 they dont see as much difference between themselves and others
4986989 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
4986990 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
4986991 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
4986992 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention
4986993 our results suggest that interventions may have a real opportunity to influence at least a quarter of the student population
4986994 we need to do more to recognize integrity among our students and find ways to tap into the bravery honest and empathy that was found in the academic heroes in our study
4986995 we are soft and heavy in places with further rain forecast later today and tomorrow
4986996 it varies from forecast to forecast as to how much we will get but in light of that we have called a precautionary inspection for 4pm tomorrow
4986997 we are now heavy after 25 millimetres of rain overnight

4987000 my loyalty is to the democrats winning barack obama is going to have a serious problem getting elected for good reason
4987001 the party needs to face the fact that without hillary clinton on the ticket the democrats will probably lose
4987002 the last mile or last kilometer is the final leg of delivering connectivity from a communications provider to a customer usually referred to by the telecommunications and cable television industries it is typically seen as an expensive challenge because fanning out wires and cables is a considerable physical undertaking

4987076 we had plenty of chances to win the game we had all the possession in the second half but we were sloppy went to sleep and it has cost us twice
4987077 the way we lost goals has been a bit of an achilles heel of ours and something weve got to work on
4987078 gt holding environment many of the client accounts i have referenced before see above show how further emotional trauma was inflicted perhaps unnecessarily because of therapist inexperience or error
4987079 gt comfortable it is natural that any threat of instability through absence can throw us off
4987080 what id like to do is talk to health and human services to get information thats going to help resolve this
4987081 if true this is particularly disturbing because the legislation specifically and unequivocally states whether or not the department has established an infection reporting system hospitals shall begin to submit reports as required by this section within six months of the effective date of this section
4987082 to prevent hospitals from rationalizing any failure to file reports based upon administrative inaction i also note that this provision of the law required the first reports to be filed not later than dec 31 2007
4987083 i am requesting that you advise me and the oversight committee which hospitals if any have filed reports and when
4987084 this is something we know is an issue we know its important to legislators and clearly we havent done it but we continue to make the effort in order to get this done
4987085 money is always a help to be sure but in this case im not sure its the biggest factor
4987086 there are so many different variables having the data out there without a framework how is the public and others going to be able to read the information
4987087 we spent a lot of time with lawmakers talking about the hospital infection reporting law my own experience in the legislature is that sometimes legislators think they can make something happen just by passing a law even if it is something that cant happen
4987088 hospitals are perfectly happy to report whatever the state wants somebody has to tell them what the rules are what are the criteria and definitions
4987089 we told the hospitals as soon as the state delivers the criteria rules and system they will comply until then they cant do it its not as if they are stonewalling this thing
4987090 the centers for disease control and prevention apparently feels there are sufficient protocols
4987091 there are some experts in this field who say protocols are available to be utilized
4987092 im happy to hear toumpas is on the case i hope more hospitals can get with it quicker
4987093 its a trade association our job is to work for the benefit not just of the public in health care but hospitals in terms of what they want to achieve
4987094 until february of this year consumers werent purchasing fuel efficient vehicles
4987095 would have had a negative impact on production and employment
4987096 our industry has been in denial for too long and in some cases it still is
4987097 with a predictable ramp up manufacturers could have mitigated the costs when high gas prices came they would have been in a much better position
4987098 as a society we tend to be reactive rather than proactive
4987099 the standards were increased only last december thats late in the game its going to force the american auto industry to retool at a time when they dont have the assets theyre already struggling
4987100 i understand if youre a guy on the line building a gmc yukon youre concerned about that product selling
4987101 but the uaw and detroit have to be looking at the bigger picture it was the quick buck it was keeping people working but that short view is really hurting us today
4987102 this downsizing will lead to substantial increases in highway deaths and serious injuries simply because all other things being equal smaller lighter cars are less able to withstand crash forces than larger heavier cars
4987103 what are you going to see sport utility vehicles probably 8 out of 10
4987104 the auto industry has to make cars that people will buy
4987105 this has been a very vast and pronounced shift in the market and manufacturers are responding
4987106 im getting 24 mpg on my nitro i was happy with that but when gas went from 2 to 4 a gallon the consumer wanted 35 mpg
4987107 its a much more appropriate business model to be profitable in everything you produce rather than in a narrow range of vehicles
4987108 but with the big 3 the trick is they have to live that long

4987123 if the purpose of inquiry is to expand the clients awareness it follows that what the therapist may learn from the clients answer is secondary while we certainly listen to the answers to our questions and learn from those answers what the client learns is much more important part of the skill involved in therapeutic inquiry is that of getting out of the clients way postponing our need to understand fully in order not to interrupt his process of discovery

4987172 the near abroad the countries bordering russia are strategically vital to its security
4987173 rightly or wrongly russia sees this as a zero sum game putin has criticised western leaders for being still locked into a but the reverse also seems to be true at least in part
4987174 nato relied for its justification on the emerging doctrine in international law that the prevention of humanitarian disaster of
4987175 whether we like it or not this is precisely the justification advanced by moscow for its intervention in georgia
4987176 putin is determined to rebuild russias stature and he is being much helped in this by the surge in energy prices
4987177 there is also evidence that after a decade and more of decline the russian armed forces are starting to rebuild and modernise
4987178 for me the right course for the west without compromising its own position and values is to show a greater understanding of why russia behaves as it does to accept more willingly russias concerns for its near abroad

4987208 een land dat door de internationale gemeenschap als zijnde een soevereine staat wordt erkend krijgt een olympisch comit als morgen joegoslavi uiteenvalt dan gaan sloveni kroati en servi waarschijnlijk elk hun eigen comit krijgen als ze beslissen van weer samen te komen wat ik persoonlijk betwijfel dan blijft dat n comit ik moet trouwens vaststellen dat er een merkwaardig proces op gang is gebracht van zodra een volk onafhankelijkheid wil cre ert men twee zaken een regering en tegelijk ook een olympisch comit heel merkwaardig en dat olympisch comit vraagt onmiddellijk erkenning bij het i o c omdat ze heel goed weten dat de sport waarschijnlijk het beste propagandamiddel is voor hun soevereiniteit de d d r heeft dat destijds b v zeer goed aangewend
4987209 zonder het zelf te beseffen stonden wij in zekere zin aan de zonnige kant van het leven er was geen armoede geen werkloosheid geen uitzichtloosheid geen maatschappij die naar excessen leidde en bijna iedereen kreeg dezelfde rechten n huis n stuk grond n auto de jacht op luxe en geld die me hier zo frappeert die trof je niet aan dat betekent dat de mensen daar op een heel andere manier met elkaar omgingen veel menselijker veel natuurlijker er was geen nijd geen afgunst het ontbrak ons alleen aan vrijheid maar ik zeg altijd vrijheid dat kan je niet eten in de ddr waren er veel renners die de top wilden halen omdat ze dan tal van privileges kregen en veel buitenlandse reizen mochten maken dat was hun bron van motivatie voor jan ullrich telden dat soort dingen niet hij wilde als wielrenner een prestatie neerzetten de rest was voor hem totaal onbelangrijk en in wezen is dat vandaag nog altijd niet veranderd jan bedrijft de wielersport nog altijd met hetzelfde uitgangspunt als vroeger hij zoekt der kampf de confrontatie met anderen dat er daaraan eventueel ook materi le dingen verbonden zijn dat interesseert hem absoluut niet

4987229 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
4987230 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information

4987234 the russians have a big head start their nuclear submarines have been all over the arctic for decades they have 16 icebreaking ships to the americans four they have a lot of experience and a lot of the right gear
4987235 and they have a lot to gain apart from fossil fuels there are important fisheries that will increasingly move north with global warming strategic control of the arctic is within their reach
4987236 the arctic needs to be about cooperation rather than competition
4987237 the arctic needs to be about cooperation rather than competition this is about matters well beyond domestic needs and national interests

4987325 the word of god thus offers us the opportunity to reflect on the universality of the mission of the church made up of peoples of every race and culture this is the origin of the great responsibility of the ecclesial community which is called to be a house of welcome for all the sign and instrument of communion for the entire human family
4987326 it is important above all in our time that every christian community deepen this awareness more and more in part for the sake of helping civil society to overcome any temptation of racism intolerance and exclusion and to organize itself with decisions respectful of the dignity of every human being one of the great achievements of humanity is in fact precisely the overcoming of racism unfortunately however there are worrying new signs of this in various countries often connected to social and economic problems which nonetheless can never justify disrespect and racial discrimination let us pray that respect for every person may increase everywhere together with the responsible awareness that only in the reciprocal welcome of all is it possible to build a world marked by authentic justice and true peace
4987327 grow accustomed to this sad reality human life is too valuable and it is unfit for man to die or be crippled by causes that in most cases could be avoided a greater sense of responsibility is certainly necessary above all on the part of drivers because accidents are often due to excessive speed and imprudent behavior driving a vehicle on the public roads requires a moral sense and a civic sense in promoting the latter of these a constant effort of prevention is indispensable the vigilance and deterrence on the part of the competent authorities as the church in fact we feel ourselves directly involved on the ethical level christians first of all must make a personal examination of conscience of their own conduct as drivers the communities should moreover educate all to consider driving as an area in which to defend life and concretely exercise love of neighbor

4987348 the knowledge that some vulnerable neonates underwent 153 tracheal aspirations or 95 heel sticks in a two week period
4987349 should elicit a thoughtful and relevant analysis on the necessity and the risk benefit ratio of our clinical practices
4987350 advances in neonatal care in recent decades with increased survival of immature and sick neonates have led to an increased number of invasive procedures that may cause pain in these vulnerable neonates
4987351 strategies to reduce the number of procedures in neonates are needed urgently

4987377 while painful stimulation generally evokes parallel cortical and behavioral responses in infants pain may be processed at the cortical level without producing detectable behavioral changes
4987378 as a result an infant with a low pain score based on behavioral assessment tools alone may not be pain free
4987379 the correlation of facial expression with cortical activity suggests that nociceptive pathways originating from the spinal cord and conveying information to the thalamus and somatosensory cortex more reliably activate the brainstem nuclei responsible for facial expression than they activate cardiovascular and respiratory control centers
4987380 may simply be due to immature motor circuitry failing to produce synchronized and coordinated muscle contraction or it may indicate a true absence of emotion
4987381 how well do clinical pain assessment tools reflect pain in infants
4987382 it feels like a slight pressure at the back of the head and thats it
4987383 no one had considered that that might be an issue
4987384 were suppressing the central nervous system but the peripheral nervous system is alive and well
4987385 if you could give that to people pre operatively you would prevent both the acute pain and the activation of tpra1 during surgery
4987386 decreased procedure times and improved satisfaction among children parents and healthcare providers
4987387 this feature is especially important when time is limited such as in a busy office practice or emergency department where topical methods of pain relief have not traditionally been available
4987388 will be determined by their efficacy compared with systemic analgesics and local anesthetics
4987389 may be explained by clinical bias and the lack of successful blinding among bedside clinicians

4987393 with respect to the broad variety of available effective and evidence based medicine proven analgesics such as nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs or opioids
4987394 our results do not suggest the use of cannabinoids as appropriate analgesics for the treatment of acute nociceptive pain in humans
4987395 inhaled cannabinoids do not undergo initial first pass metabolism in the liver and quickly reach high concentrations at their target sites in the nervous system

4987402 jayasuriya in form is always a great thing because he can contribute with both bat and ball
4987403 the start he gives makes a huge difference if he stays for 10 or 15 overs you are guaranteed a good start he is a bit like sehwag for india that gives a different dimension to our set up
4987404 whenever he sehwag gives us a good start we have a fair chance of winning the match
4987405 a good start is very important in any form of cricket but it does not mean the entire pressure is on the openers sehwag is a sort of player who takes a fair amount of risk he is a strokeplayer
4987406 he is in a very good nick and so is gautam gambhir they did well in the tests also and will have added responsibility but no pressure
4987407 jayasuriya can be compared with sehwag or retired australian adam gilchrist it is important not to let them have a good start
4987408 they are the batsmen who take chances they can commit mistakes if you try to restrict them all these players are very different but for someone like jayasuriya its important to get him out early

4987444 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4987445 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4987446 what we have is a large segment of the population who have problems and theyre not all being taken care of
4987447 you see so much about the aging population but you dont see as many numbers about the population from ages 18 to 64
4987448 however theres a larger number of people with disabilities under 65
4987449 its what we see after age 65 but its the beginning of it and we dont pay as much attention when people are younger
4987450 but thats the point in time to take preventive measures
4987451 the preferred treatment approach for all the abnormalities of persons in this group is intensive lifestyle management given its safety and the strong evidence of efficacy of this approach in improving glycemia and reducing cardiovascular risk factors
4987452 although lifestyle can clearly modify the progression of patients towards overt diabetes it may not be sufficient
4987453 emphasis must be placed on lifestyle change which can be beneficial in improving glycemic and cardiovascular risk parameters
4987454 the costs of diabetes prevention can be balanced against cost savings realized from fewer patient years of the disease a reduction in complications and decreased need for hospitalization
4987455 healthcare systems that emphasize acute care to the exclusion of disease prevention or chronic disease management will fail patients with diabetes and patients at high risk of diabetes

4987463 vaccine based therapy should be utilized in patients with a lower tumor burden that allows the immune system to mount an effective response
4987464 however even accounting for these limitations it is clear that patients with tumor characteristics consistent with slow growth and small volume and who received vaccine earlier in their treatment regimen may exhibit improved overall survival
4987465 i just had a coffee with a guy a musician i cant say who in soho well see what happens some of the boys that im hanging with will read this and think its strange when i say im single
4987466 but it takes a lot to say right were doing this there are a couple of things that i entertain myself with at the minute but its borderline platonic right now so cmon lads gear it up a bit
4987467 i still meet boys all the time they are lovely gorgeous and funny they tick all the boxes but theres one thing that happens to define love and i dont know what it is until it happens
4987468 its bizarre its the one thing we all talk about with our mates whats on our minds at the pub or at work whats the one thing we are looking for its that well it is for me and my mates
4987469 ive only done what most teenage girls have done fallen in love made some wrong decisions been treated badly by some people the only reason you become strong is because of the things you experience in life
4987470 love does fascinate me because im a bit of a control freak but real love you cant choose it thats the weird thing about it it chooses you
4987471 i did have it once with a guy i wrote stepping stone about him he wasnt a local guy in wales but he was someone i knew ive never told him that the song was about him he was so out of reach
4987472 ive never had that before it was unrequited but it was real it was all consuming
4987473 id fall over knock things over i couldnt do anything right so i just pushed it away because i thought hes not going to give me what i want to be with him for the rest of my life i never told him but i will never forget that
4987474 i would like people to say i had the worlds largest rubber band ball ever and that they probably couldnt break the record at all years from now after im gone
4987475 its crazy to think that madonna is too old at 50 it is time for someone to be a role model for the over 50s
4987476 madonna is successful because shes doing what she wants not what people want her to do she has got an amazing talent for working with the right people she knows who to work with at the right time
4987477 i think discipline extreme focus and health are all important madonna has a very good mindset she does everything she can for herself whereas a lot of people seem to turn things against themselves she doesnt do drugs she goes training she has a family life and a spiritual life
4987478 middle ear infection is a common childhood disease and obesity is a growing problem worldwide any potential association between these two public health issues is of considerable interest
4987479 this suggests that taste damage from ear infections may alter food choice and thus lead to obesity risk
4987480 this data suggests that there are lingering effects of tonsillectomies on taste nerves and that can affect eating habits

4987496 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4987515 the illegal exploitation of family members who in most instances are not suspects themselves has on many occasions caused severe psychological suffering to interrogees and to their innocent relatives in more extreme cases this method takes the form of psychological torture of a detainee rendering him a victim of a cruel psychological manipulation via the illegal exploitation of a close relative

4987521 i think if it was over today hes the greatest olympian who ever lived
4987522 i do think its difficult to compare the different sports but in terms of just sheer dominance in his events and the times hes putting up and what hes doing now in two olympics really three but two where we won medals i think its hard to argue

4987541 mendis has really bowled well in the tests and his confidence must be sky high along with muralitharan they form a very potent attack but he is not unplayable and we are working on a gameplan to counter him during the one day series
4987542 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations
4987543 i should say i am ready for the one day challenge i have been working hard in the nets i have also practiced some shots which i hope will help me counter the lankan spinners

4987545 i mean we expected it to be much tougher but in a best two out of three set doubles match anything can happen and we know that maybe the classic doubles teams are into the semifinals of the olympic games and we have a great challenge coming up
4987546 i think the lead was important it was good to sleep well and start off in a positive mindset and continue what we have been doing
4987547 it has been a great tournament for us weve played well and we improved a lot during the last match they paes bhupathi were a very good doubles team but we played together and played incredible tennis

4987553 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo

4987558 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4987559 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance

4987569 mr chen disclosed in interviews that producers had pulled peiyi a seven year old beijing girl with a
4987570 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4987571 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
4987572 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
4987573 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4987574 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4987575 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4987576 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
4987577 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
4987578 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
4987579 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4987580 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
4987581 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
4987582 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
4987583 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
4987584 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
4987585 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
4987586 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
4987587 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
4987588 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
4987589 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
4987590 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
4987591 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
4987592 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
4987593 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
4987594 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
4987595 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
4987596 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating

4987615 we are undertaking a limited number of cases to make sure our process and program are sound
4987616 hes a good hearted man and everyone loves him but he has his good days and his bad days
4987617 i was so scared i thought i was on the verge of having a stroke
4987618 he needs to be somewhere to be monitored and get himself together
4987619 right now we dont have no help nobody to see that he does what he needs to do
4987620 my hope for tac is that we make fuller use of available resources for people with mental illness enabling them to develop their full potential and become productive members of society
4987621 in doing so we will also create a community which is more just safe healthy and vibrant for all of us
4987622 within limits the use of overtime is more efficient than hiring additional staff who are needed only for unanticipated events
4987623 the negotiated agreements provide no way that management can limit the number of hours of overtime an individual works
4987624 is it really economically appropriate to be paying one person double or triple in overtime instead of hiring a second person
4987625 or are the politicians just trying to make things look good by saying that they are holding the line on hiring
4987626 we attribute the primary cause of the findings to a lack of adequate monitoring of overtime by rockland supervisors
4987627 we also believe that rockland psychiatric center officials have not clearly communicated the importance of adhering to overtime policies and procedures to employees
4987628 there is a supervisory problem at rpc no two ways about it
4987629 whenever you look at overtime its always the nurses at the large psych centers and prison who are highest
4987630 but raising the pay and hiring more workers is a tough argument during a time when everyone is talking about cutting spending
4987631 its a shell game everyone wants to show that they are holding the line on costs
4987632 if you pay well and staff right you wont have people making double and triple their salaries in overtime
4987633 the simple solution is to hire more people and cut overtime
4987634 but you cant hire if you spend all your money on overtime its a vicious cycle
4987635 its hard to say why they are paying so much overtime at the psych center
4987636 you have to question how well the place is being managed
4987637 i want patients at rockland psych to have quality care but i dont see why workers have to earn two or three times their salary in overtime or maintenance men have to be living in the paint shed
4987638 he didnt need any meds he was the kind of kid who if someone had just threatened to call his mother he probably wouldve stopped what he was doing
4987639 i understand drugs for high blood pressure for diabetes but i know mikie and i didnt need emotional stabilizers to live our lives
4987640 the people who are most respected are the ones who talk to drug companies who become consultants for multiple companies because their opinion is really valued
4987641 we prescribe the medication that works best for the patient irrespective of our relationship with a drug company
4987642 if a physician talks to all the companies and prescribes for all the companies then no company has an edge
4987643 in order to ensure that the data procured is as reliable and accurate as possible
4987644 clinical research is a critical element in the development of revolutionary medicines that help patients live longer healthier lives
4987645 you could take statistics and bar charts and make them look pretty much how you wanted them to
4987646 i saw firsthand several circumstances where my minimization of side effects or misinforming a physician had actually resulted in the patient being damaged and or killed
4987647 it makes me wonder what real safeguards there are here to protect foster children in texas from being involved in clinical trials
4987648 whether any wrong is being done or not theres certainly the perception
4987649 but i dont sit there and think hey a concerta rep came in today
4987650 there is more data out for the newer drugs which makes doctors more likely to use them thats why it appears theres something unethical going on with the drug companies when theres not
4987651 he was given three times the amount given to adult patients each of these drugs was given to us by a child psychiatrist
4987652 he was supposed to be in state care but nobody was looking after evan but me
4987653 now my kids dont take medications i wont ever trust doctors again
4987654 the state takes a child that is upset crying yelling and screaming because theyve just been taken from their families and with all those symptoms prescribes them medication
4987655 they think that if the child is unruly its easier to deal with them by medicating them than by counseling
4987656 its a medical model we didnt have any other options
4987657 i always questioned if they didnt need them out there in the real world why do they need them in here but i wasnt about to go against the doctors orders
4987658 were a lot more confident today that children who dont need these medications arent getting them
4987659 complaints would be appropriate if this movie wasnt as side splitting as it consistently is or if it didnt have the guts and discipline to take its premise to the wall and crash right through it
4987660 makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
4987661 but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
4987662 in our culture retard and retarded carry a lot of baggage from the days when people were institutionalized in large state facilities
4987663 today children with all types of disabilities are included in all types of schools people are employed in all types of jobs they work they vote they pay taxes they dont deserve to be treated in such a dehumanizing way
4987664 adults with retardation self advocated they clearly told us that the use of the word retarded was very hurtful words like retard idiot and moron create negative stereotypes that lead to discrimination and often times abuse just as certain words do for african americans or people of the jewish faith
4987665 theres probably nothing more fundamental to civil rights than the ability to name oneself you wouldnt call someone a negro today and we use asian instead of oriental

4987709 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4987710 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4987711 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same

4987820 these data suggest that men for whom salvage radiotherapy is most beneficial are those with a psa doubling time of less than six months who also undergo treatment within two years of an increase in psa level
4987821 if validated in other settings these results could motivate a clinical trial comparing adjuvant with salvage radiotherapy with prostate cancer specific survival and overall survival as the primary endpoints
4987822 for such men it is unknown whether salvage radiotherapy confers a survival benefit compared with observation
4987823 furthermore it is unknown whether the likelihood of benefit differs for immediate versus delayed salvage radiotherapy or among subgroups of men defined by pathological attributes
4987824 these results have sparked debate as to whether all patients with pt3 disease who undergo prostatectomy should receive immediate adjuvant treatment or whether close surveillance with salvage treatment provided early upon psa relapse can provide a similar benefit and avoid overtreating men who do not progress

4987838 im in no way confident we werent that good last week and managed to scrape the win whats going to happen without robsons driving runs and play
4987839 robson failed a fitness test no other reason if he were fit naka would be on the bench
4987840 dundee united will have a point to prove after hamilton taught them a lesson or two in their previous game
4987841 cant believe brown is playing instead of robson i think robson was the best player from january onwards last year
4987842 mcdonald wont be a one season wonder at celtic he wasnt a one season wonder at motherwell
4987843 maloney would be a good signing for celtic but would he get a game
4987844 its a big laugh the wages these guys get its not even on the radar for us
4987845 ive brought kovacevic and kenneth in as we were abysmal at the back against hamilton prince has not been at his best and i thought we needed more of a goal threat in midfield david robertson will give us that
4987846 i understand that mikele silvestre would be wanting around 60 000 per week so the suggestion that he might join celtic on loan from man united is not a goer theres more truth in the shaun maloney story as the possibility of bringing him back from aston villa is being discussed by celtic

4987851 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
4987852 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
4987853 our judeo christian principles dictate that we do what we can to help people who are oppressed throughout the world i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us and have freedom and democracy we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it

4987857 one of the greatest freedoms we have here in america is the freedom of speech even the freedom to protest this meeting thats a good thing but we have to learn how to have civility in our civilization how to stop being rude how to stop demonizing each other and how to have a discussion and a debate because we all want america to be a greater place

4987870 its use is not recommended in this institution as it has limited clinical bene t and toxicity
4987871 selective and continuous inhibition of cyp17 is safe and results in durable tumor responses
4987872 phase i clinical trial of a selective inhibitor of cyp17 abiraterone acetate confirms that castration resistant prostate cancer commonly remains hormone driven
4987873 the significant adverse effects and costs associated with primary androgen deprivation therapy along with our finding of a lack of overall survival benefit suggest clinicians should carefully consider the rationale for initiating primary androgen deprivation therapy in elderly patients with t1 t2 prostate cancer
4987874 because a growing body of literature now demonstrates that chronic androgen deprivation therapy has been associated with approximately 10 to 50 increases in the risks of fracture diabetes coronary heart disease myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death in addition to adverse effects on fat mass cholesterol and quality of life

4987884 in addition the white house is about to begin selecting or has already selected a contractor to restore the missing email although it is crews understanding that the white house does not intend to use backup tapes predating october 2003
4987885 it has already been established that e mails for the office of the vice president are missing for a critical week in september 2003 when the department of justice opened an investigation into the leak of valerie plame wilsons convert cia identity despite the obvious relevance of these new facts to the lawsuit the white house has refused crews request that is advise the court of these events and bring transparency to the process
4987886 learned that not all email of the office of the vice president and the executive office of the president for certain time periods in 2003 was preserved through the normal archiving process on the white house computer system

4987889 when workstations are at the end of their lifecycle and retired under the refresh program the hard drives are generally sent offsite to another government entity for physical destruction in accordance with department of defense guidelines
4987890 we are pleased that despite the white houses plea for reconsideration the magistrate judge stood his ground and recommended that the white house be ordered to locate and preserve e mails that may be missing from backup tapes but were saved on individual workstations and portable media devices

4987942 this simple intervention could be offered to women to improve the mammography experience and break the cycle of anxiety and fear that leads to delays and avoidance of this potentially lifesaving procedure
4987943 the expected discomfort scores indicate that the general belief in this motivated population of women was that undergoing mammography hurts
4987944 we do not know however how many women do not schedule mammography at all because of this same concern

4987974 peripheral arterial disease is becoming a huge problem because of the aging of the population and the increasing incidence of diabetes
4987975 we dont have good diagnostics for it partly because a lot of the methods we have are based on measuring whats going on in the big vessels
4987976 pad is a complex very diffuse disease which often involves functional abnormalities in the microcirculation system how well the microcirculation system is functioning is what determines how well tissue is getting fed which is the critical issue
4987977 contrast enhanced ultrasound perfusion imaging may be useful for evaluating the total impact of disease in patients with complex disease or those with coexisting functional abnormalities of flow regulation
4987978 limb stress rest perfusion imaging with contrast ultrasound for the assessment of peripheral arterial disease severity
4987979 not only is this grossly wrong but i challenge anyone to define race biologically
4987980 people focus on perceived difference but the fact is that humans are an amazingly undiversified species there is a remarkable sameness about us all
4987981 some of my points may prove to be wrong and may be seen as politically incorrect

4987983 the human family albeit first cradled in africa has been going forth from africa intermittently for over two million years although modern human features first appear in africa and the middle east a few hundred thousand years ago

4987985 tiap tiap umat ada utusannya maka apabila utusan mereka datang dengan adil perkara diputuskan antara mereka dan mereka tidak dizalimi
4987986 sesungguhnya kami telah membangkitkan dalam tiap tiap umat seorang utusan yang berpesan menghambalah kepada tuhan dan jauhilah sesembahan lain itu

4987990 wahai orang kitab sungguh telah datang kepada kamu utusan kami dengan menjelaskan kepada kamu pada masa jeda utusan utusan supaya kamu tidak mengatakan tidak datang kepada kami seorang pembawa kabar gembira dan tidak juga seorang pemberi peringatan
4987991 supaya kamu memperingatkan kaum yang bapak bapak mereka tidak diberi peringatan maka mereka lalai
4987992 sesungguhnya kami mengutus kamu dengan benar pembawa berita gembira dan pemberi peringatan
4987993 dan tiadalah sesuatu umat selain telah berlalu di dalamnya seorang pemberi peringatan
4987994 bahkan mereka berkata sesungguhnya kami mendapati bapak bapak kami atas sesuatu anutan agama ummatin dan kami mendapat petunjuk atas jejak jejak mereka
4987995 dan telah berkata orang yang telah selamat dari mereka berdua dan teringat setelah sesuatu waktu ummatin aku akan memberitakan kamu interpretasinya maka utuslah aku
4987996 these increases were not different from the incidences of contrast nephropathy previously published
4987997 creatinine change as a de facto standard for contrast induced nephropathy
4987998 it could be used more frequently in patients with renal failure which could both increase the diagnostic capacity of ct and avoid the cost and risk of gadolinium enhanced mri
4987999 were undoubtedly caused by the entire range of conditions treatments and laboratory variations that may alter creatinine levels
4988000 the incidences from our data are higher than many reported in the contrast exposed populations
4988001 frequency of serum creatinine changes in the absence of iodinated contrast material implications for studies of contrast nephrotoxicity
4988002 a prediction rule obtained using quantitative ultrasound stiffness index and four clinical risk factors helped discriminate with high sensitivity women at higher versus those at lower risk for osteoporotic fracture
4988003 moreover integration of heel quantitative ultrasound parameters may be an effective alternative to dual x ray in response to the expected growth in demand for osteoporosis management in the next three decades
4988004 quantitative ultrasound of the heel is noninvasive free of radiation and relatively inexpensive
4988005 moreover it helps predict fracture risk independently of dual photon absorptiometry
4988006 the 23 speci city obtained with our score may be deemed suboptimal however the objective when elaborating our score was to improve the detection of women who need additional procedures such as densitometry and preventive intervention therefore as with all screening tests this method must privilege sensitivity the true positive rate rather than speci city
4988007 our analysis included neither women with secondary osteoporosis nor women older than 85 years of age and our prediction rule may not be used with these populations
4988008 this percentage compares well with reported outcomes of external beam or stereotactic radiotherapy in this patient population
4988009 it just proves that in the hands of experienced interventionalists this is a very safe procedure even in very ill patients
4988010 moreover the high risk of recurrence and the need to remove functioning lung tissue along with the lesions restricts indications for surgery
4988011 a randomized controlled trial comparing radiofrequency ablation versus standard treatment options is now warranted to prove the clinical benefit of this approach
4988012 ngai tahu takes the waterways very seriously and great care is being taken in protecting the waterways recycling the water where possible keeping the waterways in the same areas and probably returning areas that have been scoured out and drained and channeled into wetlands and waterways that are more traditional mr schwartfeger says
4988013 it hopefully is a galvanizing point it hopefully is a place that maori leaders and leaders in the wider community also can use as a reference point for helping them develop plans and also create opportunities through collaboration across sectors and across businesses and across iwi boundaries to work together
4988014 his work at massey and his support of maori education across the tertiary sector beyond massey into every university is undeniable and he continues to impassion maori studying but also impassion non maori in issues associated with maori and i think thats a success across the tertiary sector not just for massey
4988015 we want to work with the people that are there now but more particularly we want to work with the people who are coming forward now the growth of our young people in terms of numbers their desire to learn to participate in all of the cultural activities its the ideal venue for that and we want to use that id like to see it used 15 16 hours a day every day of the week because it can be a home for so many
4988016 some communities who have real serious problems in terms of water quality many of them on the old septic tank systems and get a lot of seepage into the underground water supply its all linked to community health primary health and the health of families because the best water quality we can provide to families is essential in terms of their health status

4988018 mammography facility characteristics associated with interpretive accuracy of screening mammography
4988019 the correlation between olfactory bulb volume and olfactory function may potentially be used in combination with other factors influencing olfaction such as remaining olfactory function age and duration of olfactory loss as a means to provide patients with individual information on the prognosis of their disease
4988020 especially since therapeutic options in patients with olfactory loss are limited at present this type of information is of high clinical significance
4988021 this would support the idea of olfactory bulb volumetry as a prognostic tool in assessing the course of postinfectious and posttraumatic olfactory loss
4988022 the present study emphasizes that olfactory bulb volume correlates with olfactory function and our data support the evidence that the human olfactory bulb is a highly plastic structure
4988023 correlation of olfactory function with changes in the volume of the human olfactory bulb
4988024 we dont have details on either charge yet and we havent been presented with evidence so we cant comment further at this stage
4988025 the draft in my possession was already damning but the version obtained by the sunday times is even more scathing
4988026 large chunks regarding warnings of the risks involved are even more explicit than the warnings contained in the draft
4988027 the only logical conclusion to be drawn is that cabinet deliberately ignored the warnings because huge bribes were being paid by the arms deal companies

4988040 instead of simply utilizing nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence they the us will start manufacturing bombs and other devices of mass destruction for the purpose of actually using them and the most important point i believe is that they clearly stated their intention to use those weapons in combat
4988041 overwheening even crazy and criminal by what it implies and one that did not come out of president bush juniors head to be implemented by an extreme right junta seizing power through dubious elections
4988042 it is the project which the ruling class of the united states has unceasingly nurtured since 1945 even though its implementation evidently passed through ups and downs encountered a few vicissitudes and was here and there checked and could be not be pursued with the consistency and violence that this implied in certain conjunctural moments like that following the disintegration of the soviet union
4988043 the objective of us global policy is not just power for its own sake but the
4988044 it is notably in the middle east and surrounding the question of palestine that the united states has systematically instituted impunity in the face of violations of international law
4988045 when i speak before american university students i say this to them if i were to write a book called the american empire for dummies page one would say dont ever look for the moral factor us foreign policy has no moral factor built into its dna clear your mind of that baggage which only gets in the way of seeing beyond the clich s and the platitudes they feed us
4988046 military necessity does not admit of the inflicting of suffering for the sake of suffering or revenge nor of wounding except in fight nor of torture to extort confessions it does not admit of the use of poison in any way or of the wanton devastation of a district art 16
4988047 such a felt sense of political responsibility for empires actions by its citizens is dependent on viewing oneself not as an innocent or impotent bystander but rather as an implicated agent
4988048 do have a responsibility to act to resist empire this is based on an analysis of the impunity of empire for it is the idea that there is a nonreciprocal right of empire to run roughshod over everyone else in the name of spreading its own values and its own conception of security globally one of the essential hallmarks of empires law that must be contested
4988049 ethically motivated and informed global action has no adequately global instruments
4988050 what the american empire fears and i think rightly is that such strategies may contribute to our capacities to become the strong my claim is that such politically inspired attempts litigating against american empire under international humanitarian law may contribute to the goals of cultivating a sense of poitical responsibility while both depending on political action for their broad effectivity and contributing to further political action

4988053 ada sebagian ulama ekstrem yang mengatakan bahwa husein bin ali cucu kesayangan nabi saw dan allah meredhainya bersalah karena telah melakukan pembangkangan terhadap yazid penguasa yang selalu meminum khamar dan melecehkan kehormatannya semoga allah mengutuk orang orang itu yang telah mengatakan hal hal aneh yang membuat bulu roma berdiri ketika mendengarnya
4988054 bagaimana ia tidak dilaknat sementara allah telah melaknatnya di dalam
4988055 dan apakah kiranya jika kamu berkuasa kamu akan melakukan kerusakan di muka bumi dan memutuskan hubungan kekeluargaan
4988056 dalam masalah laknat terhadap yazid ahmad bin hanbal memiliki dua pernyataan yang satu singgungan dan yang kedua secara terang terangan melaknat yazid demikian juga halnya dengan imam malik dan imam abu hanifah mengapa harus menolak laknat kepada yazid sementara ia adalah orang yang gemar berjudi dan selalu meminum khamar
4988057 jika di dunia ada sebuah pemerintahan adil yang bertujuan menegakkan syariat dan hukum allah lalu ada orang zalim yang melawan dan ingin menghancurkan pemerintahan adil itu setiap individu muslim wajib membantu dan membela pemerintahan adil dalam melawan orang zalim dari di sinilah imam husein bangkit melakukan perlawanan terhadap kekuasaan yazid yang dihinakan allah
4988058 ahmad bin hanbal memperbolehkan laknat atasnya kami juga tidak menyukainya karena ia telah melakukan kejahatan besar terhadap anak cucu nabi saw jika ada yang tidak puas denhgan jawaban ini kami mengatakan bahwa prinsip yang sebenarnya adalah dengan melaknat yazid
4988059 husein terbunuh tanpa dosa sedang pakaiannya telah berubah berwarna merah oleh darahnya sungguhnya aneh yang dilakukan oleh umat ini di satu sisi kita bersolawat kepada nabi pilihan dari bani hasyim sementara di sisi lain kita membantai dan menyiksa anak cucunya jika aku dituduh berdosa karena kecintaanku kepada keluarga muhammad saw maka aku tak akan bernah bertaubat atas dosa ini merekalah kelak yang akan memberiku syafaat di hari mahsyar memusuhi mereka bagi syafii adalah dosa yang tak terampuni
4988060 aku memerangimu demi memperoleh jabatan di kawasan rey dan ladang serta kebun kebunnya
4988061 inilah jibril as memberitakan kepadaku tentang suatu tanah di tepi sungai furat yang bernama karbala di situ akan terbunuh cucuku husein putra fatimah
4988062 seorang lelaki bernama yazid allah tidak akan memberkatinya sekarang ini seolah aku menyaksikan peristiwa tersebut dan tempat ia dimakamkan sedangkan kepalanya telah dijadikan sebagai barang hadiah demi allah tak seorang pun yang menyaksikan kepala anakku ini kemudian ia merasa senang akan hal itu maka allah akan menolak agamanya
4988063 ya allah aku muhammad hamba mu dan nabi mu dan kedua anak ini adalah keturunan terbaikku buah hatiku dan pewarisku setelahku ya allah jibril telah memberitahuku bahwa anakku ini akan terbunuh dan terhina di dunia
4988064 apakah kalian menangis saat ini tetapi kalian tidak menolongnya ya allah jadilah engkau penolong dan pemberinya kemenangan

4988074 solo per aver dichiarato pubblicamente quello che tutti pensiamo e cio che lo spezzamento dei due eurostar a milano il 14 e 22 luglio scorsi stato un incidente potenzialmente molto pericoloso e un campanello d allarme che pone con forza allattenzione di tutti la questione della manutenzione della progettazione e dei controlli sugli etr

4988076 aber mikko ist auf asphalt viel st rker geworden eine vorentscheidung ist das noch nicht ich wollte von anfang an zeigen wer herr im hause ist seit es den deutschen wm lauf gibt hat ihn noch nie jemand anderes gewonnen als ich und das sollte gef lligst auch so bleiben
4988077 ich h tte platz drei bevorzugt aber p4 auf asphalt ist so schlecht nicht f r mich
4988078 wir hatten einige gute abschnitte und haben ein paar tolle zwischenzeiten gesetzt wenn wir jetzt noch die konstanz in den griff bekommen dann sieht das f r die kommenden asphalt rallyes gar nicht so aus
4988079 ich hatte keinerlei probleme wir hatten schon eine ganze zeit lang keine so saubere fahrt mehr ich hatte viel spa und das auto bekommt immer besseren grip und auch die traktion passt wir haben noch einen langen weg vor uns aber die richtung stimmt definitiv

4988081 die performance des autos ist sehr erfreulich gewesen an diesem wochenende es wird einfach immer besser
4988082 mein team hat beim testen einen fantastischen job gemacht und wir wollten hier ein gutes resultat holen simoncelli war im ersten sektor sehr stark aber hinten raus witterte ich meine chance wir hatten dieses wochenende neue teile und sind jetzt wieder im wm rennen
4988083 es war ein netter fight in dem ich noch zweiter wurde wenn ich nicht zwei runden vor schluss eine ber hrung mit debon gehabt h tte h tte ich aber auch gewinnen k nnen
4988084 und dann musste ich h rter als die anderen pushen um den abstand zu verringern das war f r den vorderreifen nicht einfach
4988085 der vorsprung auf kallio in der weltmeisterschaft ist gr er geworden das ist am wichtigsten ich bin auch mit dem rennergebnis zufrieden aber nicht damit dass ich gef hrt und doch nicht gewonnen habe es waren nur noch zwei kurven nat rlich bin ich da ein bisschen entt uscht aber wie gesagt auch nicht ganz unzufrieden

4988332 overall im pleased that i scored better than last year at the world championships and still have something to give im not one to give up i know im better than that and thats what spurs me on i just didnt have it in two events

4988366 expanding my role at the wuxi apptec philadelphia site is an exciting opportunity
4988367 and i look forward to working with our excellent team on the continuing goal of making this facility the best in its class for outsourced process development and contract manufacturing
4988368 i am very excited to lead all the philadelphia laboratories as we continue expansion of our capabilities and capacities to provide the biologics industry with the highest quality in testing services
4988369 wuxi apptec is fortunate to have two such experienced and talented managers within our organization to tap for these important roles
4988370 their deep understanding of the industry their many years with the company and their proven track record as leaders will be tremendous assets as the philadelphia facility continues to grow and strengthen its services for the biologics industry
4988371 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics
4988372 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
4988373 it means i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know that i dont walk alone but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
4988374 our judeo christian principles dictate that we do what we can to help people who are oppressed throughout the world i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us and have freedom and democracy we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it
4988375 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights

4988378 one of the greatest freedoms we have here in america is the freedom of speech even the freedom to protest this meeting thats a good thing but we have to learn how to have civility in our civilization how to stop being rude how to stop demonizing each other and how to have a discussion and a debate because we all want america to be a greater place

4988401 the social networking phenomenon that is facebook may soon become the keeper of your online identity
4988402 because facebook is wildly popular the service stands a chance of turning your facebook identity into an uber identity for the web others have tried this yet none has gained broad enough acceptance to become a de facto standard

4988427 of all the touches we have shared and may yet share there will never be another quite like our first embrace in the instant in which our bodies met for the first time my heart paused for just a single beat in its otherwise steadfast pace as if to acknowledge the power of a force more significant than the two of us and suddenly more nourishing and sustaining than the flow of my own vitality in that instant i realized just how much i had come to love you rely on you and i smiled inwardly at the revelation that you were the person i wanted to spend the rest of my life with i knew i wanted to keep on kissing you holding you standing beside you against the wind and loving you for all my remaining years even after i shuffle from this mortal coil i know my soul will hold vigil just beyond the breach until you are at my side once again for no life nor afterlife could be paradise unless you were there

4988435 chief im not so sure its all that open and shut
4988436 how do you mean terrorists hate america someone is trying to poison america logic points us towards terrorists thats open and shut
4988437 thats what i mean chief it cant be terrorists it just doesnt make any sense
4988438 well chief the first rule of detective ing is to figure out who has the most to gain from any given crime
4988439 i know what it means guinness you didnt have to translate it
4988440 still chief were straying from the topic who would benefit the most from anthrax attacks terrorists no way and heres why when we get attacked by terrorists we dont even think twice about it we cut the motherfuckers everybody knows that were like dolemite but with nukes
4988441 so we have to figure that terrorists wouldnt do it because they know theyd just be signing their own death warrant
4988442 by god guinness youre right the scientists who work on anthrax research the more attacks we receive the more funding theyd get for their research its the scientists
4988443 i want you doing everything you can to track this lead down shake up all of your informants get your hands dirty and get tacos on the case too
4988444 do whatever you need to do to solve this case
4988445 lets just ask him straight out if hes mailing anthrax to people i am so sick of beating around the bush
4988446 lets not give out too much info too soon ive got a hunch about this one if we ask him hes gonna think were on to him we need make him think that we think that anthrax is cool that way hell admit to mailing out anthrax to people just to impress us
4988447 wed just like to ask you a few quick questions professor ivins if thats alright with you
4988448 i think what my colleague is trying to say is do you enjoy working with anthrax professor ivins

4988451 here professor ill just write down our contact info on this sheet where you keep all of your other addresses

4988481 he wants to drive to the place where they left her and make sure she is no longer there
4988482 always encouraging me we never had a quarrel she can never be replaced
4988483 i would be happy to work very hard for this country
4988484 as long as there is justice and the rule of law is respected and those that committed crimes are actually brought to book but without that i feel that my wife died for nothing
4988485 the government is doing this deliberately because when people are hungry they are pliable
4988486 esta medalla el boxeo dominicana la esperaba desde hace 24 a os
4988487 cambiar el color de esa medalla e ir por el oro
4988488 en el primer asalto ten a un punto de desventaja pero no me sent nervioso en ning n momento sab a que con la excelente preparaci n que tuve iba a elevar el ritmo y tirar los golpes
4988489 every athletes goal is to make the olympics and this year was my best chance of making the team
4988490 maybe i was na ve in thinking usa cycling would support me in getting a spot for the team in reality i felt like they worked against me to get the spot
4988491 was not deprived of a fair opportunity to compete for an olympic position
4988492 usac handled the coaching aspect of their role as a national governing body in a way that created legitimate doubts about whether every rider had a fair chance to compete
4988493 usa cycling didnt feel it was necessary to roster any riders to help me hang onto the jersey they basically said they werent interested in having me make the olympics
4988494 assistance was offered by riders on other trade teams and usa cycling said no
4988495 we do not create a team strategy in these events there are multiple americans in the field who by winning could make the olympic team
4988496 if we do that were really asking someone to give up their olympic dream and then wed be in arbitration and rightfully so
4988497 an equal opportunity to participate in amateur athletic competition without discrimination
4988498 usa cycling told quinn they had no strategy to protect her spot because they already had a person who could ride the olympic points race
4988499 and that person just happens to be the fianc of the guy coaching riders in the race
4988500 sexual romantic relationships with athletes or other participants over whom the coach has evaluative direct or indirect authority
4988501 yeah sparks and sarah are together everybody knows it sparks is the best track coach in the country right now
4988502 we made sure to tell our riders that sparks was never involved in any team selection and if they had any problem with him to talk to dickey or myself
4988503 to me it was interesting that quinn admitted is that she never came to me dickey usac ceo steve johnson or anyone to say she had a problem with sparks
4988504 then all of a sudden its after world championships when everything was over and quinn sits down with me and lays all of this stuff out where did it come from
4988505 although usac officials had done some planning about how to deal with the problem of conflicted coaches they had not thoroughly thought the problem through
4988506 there was no evidence from which i could clearly see that there was an improper motive
4988507 the evidence is clear that she did not get such support it is also quite clear that quinn did not directly ask for such support
4988508 the evidence generally showed that the lack of support occurred
4988509 the evidence also showed that there were reasons for these events that were understandable and not the result of any bias toward ms quinn
4988510 if quinn would have won then we would have had to decide who lost their spot
4988511 i have no idea how we would have done that
4988512 why would i want to steal a spot from someone who qualified fair and square
4988513 our burden was to prove that the system was flawed and unfortunately we didnt do that but if i can open up the can of worms to keep this from happening again thats what im going to do
4988514 woombie says august 15th 2008 at 10 13 am hey hey heeeey now clay aiken doesnt look that gay i mean if you close one eye and squint the other and hold your breath until you are seeing spots he looks rather like chuck norris younger less manly brother delish jones

4988523 i have finished the work which you gave me to do
4988524 i am used to the atmosphere and able to tune it out and focus then soak it all in as i cross the finish line
4988525 at my first olympics i was a baby i looked around and i was like oh my gosh there are a lot of people out here now i just tune everybody out its like tunnel vision and i see my ten hurdles and the finish line
4988526 me and vonnette her and i hit hands a couple of times so i have to make sure in the next rounds to get out so i dont have to deal with that issue as the rounds go on
4988527 i wasnt sure whether i was going to go or not
4988528 its one of the best decisions ive made in my entire life
4988529 theyre very proud people every five feet each building has a greek flag
4988530 people arent as confrontational if you bump into somebody in downtown chicago there might be a problem if you bump into somebody in greece they might talk to you for a half hour
4988531 in america you can get hammered and not get a foul call over in greece if you breathe on somebody they call the foul
4988532 its not quite a run and gun but its very paced

4988539 we were really looking for blogs that know their state well
4988540 it helps us have a larger audience and a very specific audience in a lot of cases
4988541 i was on a conference call earlier with a bunch of the other bloggers that are coming
4988542 many of them expressed that they dont know what they will be doing i dont know what im going to do and were just going to see what happens and try to find out and cover whats going on
4988543 in terms of how news is reported and how much its dominated by television coverage the political convention does seem like a show
4988544 i think theres going to be so many other meetings happening networking happening things that arent even happening in the pepsi center
4988545 i feel just fine with writing with a biased or partisan point of view
4988546 if you look at what i write about and how i write about it i think i have a very good track record of telling it the way it is
4988547 i highly disagree with the term cheerleader there have been plenty of times when i have called out democrats for decisions ive disagreed with

4988594 we could have set this up with a studio and probably got any one of seven likely suspects
4988595 if you blink or if you hesitate you will fail its like running across hot coals if you stop and think about what youre doing you wont make it but if you can do a really big performance and pull it off the stakes are high but so are the rewards

4988598 cosa con la que creo que todo el mundo est totalmente de acuerdo nadie tiene ni idea de c mo se priorizan las cosas ni de lo que pasa
4988599 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
4988600 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii

4988604 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4988605 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
4988606 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4988607 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4988608 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4988609 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4988610 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4988611 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4988612 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4988613 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4988614 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4988615 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
4988616 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
4988617 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4988618 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4988619 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4988620 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4988621 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4988622 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4988623 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4988624 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4988625 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4988626 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4988627 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4988628 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4988629 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4988630 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4988631 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4988632 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4988633 it would require asking very sensitive questions in a survey which would lead respondents to hang up
4988634 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4988635 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4988636 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4988637 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4988638 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4988639 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4988640 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4988641 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4988642 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4988643 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4988644 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4988645 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4988646 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4988647 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4988648 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4988649 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4988650 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4988651 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4988652 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4988653 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4988654 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4988655 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4988656 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4988657 we are at manchester now we will have a press conference tomorrow and the deal will be announced today during a manchester united game
4988658 the arrangement is said to be one of the biggest non shirt sponsorship deals in british football
4988659 i am horrified by the reports detailing the abuse ginelis jimenez suffered at the hands of her parents it is impossible to understand how a childs parents could be capable of such maltreatment and abuse i am working with the administration for childrens services acs to determine whether they had previous contact with the family and what if anything could have prevented this from happening
4988660 sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire che rinunciare a te
4988661 hai idea di quanto importante tu sia per me riesci a renderti conto di quanto ti amo
4988662 he was actually the one that kind of calmed me down at the end of that hungary match
4988663 i was looking at him in the crowd he just told me to stay calm focus
4988664 shes had such a tough year with my mom and me being sick and having to deal with all that and really not having any time for herself
4988665 now she can really relax and enjoy the rest of the olympic experience
4988666 being one point ahead at the end thats all that matters
4988667 theyre exceptionally tall so to try to get touches on them can be extremely difficult
4988668 i dont think we even expected this to turn out as it did
4988669 we were the underdogs going into all of our matches some other countries didnt expect us to be as strong as we were
4988670 last time around my parents they knew how close keeth was one point
4988671 this is what they wanted they wanted us to finally medal it feels like a family medal to me
4988672 it is particularly galling to find that they are prepared to take in vain the name of an organisation which works to protect consumers and businesses from scams and unfair practice
4988673 oh dontcha know our neighbor carl is showin off quite a pair of antlers on the canadian pr0n channel eh
4988674 he deserves every ounce of respect and admiration and attention that he gets because what hes doing is incredibly phenomenal
4988675 being his teammate for so many years you get desensitized to how amazing he is i think many years down the road me and the other members of the team will realize what an incredible performance he put on for everybody here
4988676 i mean its something im incredibly proud of but it was never a goal of mine to be the most decorated female swimmer or anything like that im very happy with the six medals i have hopefully ill get some more in london

4988678 i think i forced myself to get back in too early after athens

4988680 ive got my wedding come up so i want to be in good shape
4988681 it took a lot of pressure off me for the rest of the meet
4988682 i remember leaving athens i was like wow i dont remember that
4988683 i was just overwhelmed with the entire experience i think that gave me a bit of an advantage this time i did make a conscious effort to stay present in the moment
4988684 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4988736 when youre writing a commercial youre not writing an essay
4988737 i have community with others and i shall continue to have it only through jesus christ the more genuine and the deeper our community becomes the more will everything else between us recede the more clearly and purely will jesus christ and his work become the one and only thing that is vital between us we have one another only through christ but through christ we do have one another wholly and for all eternity
4988738 we conclude therefore that a christian lives not in himself but in christ and in his neighbor otherwise he is not a christian he lives in christ through faith in his neighbor through love by faith he is caught up beyond himself into god by love he descends beneath himself into his neighbor
4988739 the community which god is forming is forged by the gospel the gospel gives us our distinct identity and values we are to uniquely embody the story of what god has done in jesus christ in our life together therefore by the quality of our life together the church both proclaims the message of the gospel and is the goal of the gospel understood in this way we can say that the church is the good news
4988740 the community is therefore not only the receiver of the word of revelation it is itself revelation the community is the body of christ body here is not just a metaphor the community is the body of christ it does not represent the body of christ
4988741 we were born into a world into a condition of disconnection things were created to be a certain way and theyre not that way and we feel it in every fiber of our being and so from an early age we have this awareness of the state of disconnection we were born into and we have a longing to reconnect
4988742 i hurt my back and i cant pull myself up into your boat
4988743 just try to hold on until we get to your boat

4988745 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4988746 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4988747 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4988748 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4988749 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4988750 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4988751 this year the pilgrimage was nice except for the iskandariya incident
4988752 it was added because of transgressions until the seed to whom the promise referred had come
4988753 on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets
4988754 for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this you will love your neighbor as yourself
4988755 therefore whatever you want men to do to you do also to them for this is the law and the prophets
4988756 tells about one man because he loved and was concern for children drove slowly near the school so that they would not be in danger
4988757 let no debt remain outstanding except the continuing debt to love one another for he who loves his fellow man has fulfilled the law
4988758 the commandments do not commit adultery do not murder do not steal do not covet
4988759 then paul summed up the entire law system when he concluded
4988760 this is the message that you heard from the beginning we should love one another do not be like cain who murdered his brother
4988761 the law was not made for a righteous person but for the lawless and disobedient
4988762 so since jesus never sinned nor was unrighteous then he was never under law
4988763 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness self control
4988764 woe to you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have neglected the weightier matters of the law justice and mercy and faith these you ought to have done without leaving the others undone
4988765 woe to you pharisees because you give god a tenth of your mint rue and all other kinds of garden herbs but you neglect justice and the love of god
4988766 my command is this love each other as i have loved you
4988767 will this build up strengthen edify make our faith stronger or make us more christ like or more spiritual will this be a way to express our love and

4988772 we are all in the mud but some of us are looking at the stars
4988773 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story
4988774 theres an opportunity now for us to come forward and to lay all the facts out so that she can reconsider her decision not to permit the judiciary committee to proceed with a full impeachment hearing
4988775 he is going down as the worst president ever the facts are in
4988776 its just that most of the time in the uk we spend too much energy chasing the dangling carrot of film council money or other free money and neglect the whole point of what we do specifically telling stories that really move audiences
4988777 thats great because he is one of the good guys making films with passion for all the right reasons
4988778 the basic agreements do not determine the ceiling for the peacekeeping contingents
4988779 how long it will take i have already emphasized that it depends not only on us we are constantly facing problems created by the georgian side
4988780 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4988781 the key task now is to transfer all refugees from temporary camps in north ossetia to stationary facilities we should also have to set up a humanitarian centre in tskhinvali to hand out aid to pay compensation for the lost property we need it so that people can live there in normal conditions so that they can be provided with food and medical help
4988782 it has not started yet the question of withdrawal is being considered now and the decision will be taken as the situation in the region is stabilised
4988783 what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
4988784 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4988785 the world and countries in the region have seen that not nato but russia is the only one who could secure the energy routes
4988786 in this context regarding turkeys energy politics it should be said that the btc is not running at the moment and it will not run again
4988787 yes i know theyre new but i asked if you think they make me look ugly
4988788 glasses arent exactly attractive unless you have a really funky pair that screams personality
4988789 this system will save crucial time lost in conducting exams and the process of correcting papers and bring in transparency in the entire process of getting into civil services
4988790 there are lot of complaints that the interview board differentiates between candidates so we feel that videographing the whole process will help end this kind of discrimination
4988791 remember where you came from where youre going and why you created the mess you got yourself into in the first place
4988792 the past is like the phrase used by tourists in my city its a nice place to visit but i wouldnt want to live there
4988793 you are not a hero just another person who can fight better than others around you namely the others are civilian npcs
4988794 mmmh stai proprio bene con quel cappello uguale al mio
4988795 it seems to me its pretty much a slam dunk
4988796 owed a duty of care the highest degree of care
4988797 one of the real areas of satisfaction if you can call it that is that weve maintained all along this was an inside job
4988798 i hope somebody who has some authority will call us and make it right with this family
4988799 it seems to me they botched this thing from the beginning it was one of their own people

4988801 what florida residents would hope for is that the storm stays over land as much as possible but right now the forecast doesnt call for that

4988803 they should top off their vehicles with fuel make sure they have the supplies they need
4988804 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4988805 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4988806 i wish peace for my country and for our children we do not want to live in fear

4988809 abkhazia has its obligations to the people of south ossetia and it is fulfilling them
4988810 by its actions in south ossetia georgia showed that in reality it wants to see the resolution of both the georgian ossetian and the georgian abkhaz conflicts only by force
4988811 after the west did not react for several days to the georgian artillery leveling tskhinval the capital of south ossetia it became completely obvious to us that nobody needs either the abkhaz or the ossetians
4988812 no one except russia is planning to defend us thats why we are accepting the big increase in the russian military presence in abkhazia calmly they are guaranteeing our security
4988813 its quite a surreal treat to sunbathe on the beach with russian warships lined up in the port
4988814 i dont think any tourist firm would offer that and if they did it would be only for lots of money

4988867 the patient must utilise the technology usefully in the correct perspective instead of dissection discussion and hair splitting
4988868 the internet which is very useful to most of us can supply ideas to the patient to gain knowledge to pose intelligent questions to the urologist and forget the actual purpose of the visit to the doctor
4988869 the urologist may have a tough time treating such patients successfully and satisfactorily
4988870 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront

4988874 what makes people truly happy is how they live inside of themselves
4988875 meaning that if you want enduring satisfaction you have to approach life with a mind set that allows you to walk on the bright side no matter whats thrown at you
4988876 it helps minimize fears about the future that could otherwise become debilitating allowing you to move past them more quickly and ultimately lead a more carefree life
4988877 feeling isolated makes it easy to succumb to negative feelings like self doubt and insecurity
4988878 but spending time with loved ones strengthens the human connections that silence those self defeating thoughts and improve mood
4988879 if you behave contrary to what you believe you go to war with yourself
4988880 one of my favorite quotes is from a famous 1920s physician who said health is the optimal condition that allows for the ultimate engagement in life
4988881 what hes saying is that health doesnt necessarily mean being fit but being able to live fully
4988882 altruism connects you to others gives you a purpose and gets you outside yourself
4988883 if you measure your current happiness against the greatest moments in your life you might be disappointed because those moments are hard to beat
4988884 but if you measure todays satisfaction against some of your tougher days you have all the reason in the world to appreciate your life right now
4988885 finding humor in a bad situation is a shift in perception that gives people the guts to push forward even when things look grim
4988886 if youre not sure what your purpose is then your purpose is to find a passion
4988887 when what you do with your daily life really talks to your heart youll be truly happy
4988888 its been a lifelong dream of mine to wrestle in the olympics
4988889 we have been in serious training if this opportunity became available

4988891 the conditions are like you have to prepare for at any venue you have to be world class at five knots and world class at 25 knots
4988892 the conditions were quite like britain big wind and rain we were quite prepared
4988893 you have very light winds but then we had a low pressure system coming in from the southwest
4988894 that its difficult to say in the morning what will happen in the afternoon
4988895 the same happened at the 06 and 07 test events one day was really windy
4988896 a mosquito will not get in the way of my preparation for the olympics games in beijing
4988897 i dont know what happened i cant explain what happened here this afternoon
4988898 i had done that exercise 15 or 20 times and everything had always gone well
4988899 i never imagined this could happen to me that is a routine ive been doing for years and it never went wrong
4988900 i am very sorry brazilians i should have won a medal
4988901 the conditions are like you have to prepare for at any venue you have to be world class at five knots and world class at 25 knots
4988902 the conditions were quite like britain big wind and rain we were quite prepared
4988903 you have very light winds but then we had a low pressure system coming in from the southwest
4988904 that its difficult to say in the morning what will happen in the afternoon
4988905 the same happened at the 06 and 07 test events one day was really windy
4988906 from my point of view and im in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4988907 there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
4988908 i dont think if you got bin laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared
4988909 just as sept 11 revolutionized our resolve to defeat our enemies so has it brought into focus the opportunities we now have to secure and expand our freedom

4988912 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
4988913 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
4988914 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
4988915 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
4988916 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
4988917 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
4988918 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
4988919 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
4988920 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
4988921 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
4988922 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
4988923 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
4988924 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
4988925 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
4988926 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
4988927 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
4988928 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
4988929 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

4988945 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4988946 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4988947 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4988948 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade

4988954 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

4989037 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred

4989039 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4989057 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4989058 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4989059 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4989060 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4989061 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4989062 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4989063 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4989064 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4989065 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4989066 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4989067 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4989068 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4989069 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4989070 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4989071 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4989072 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4989073 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4989074 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4989075 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

4989081 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4989082 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4989083 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4989084 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4989085 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4989086 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4989087 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4989088 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4989089 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4989090 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4989091 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4989092 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4989093 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4989094 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4989095 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4989096 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4989097 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4989098 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4989099 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4989100 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4989101 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages

4989105 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4989106 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4989133 this project is well on target we will be delivering houses in november 2008
4989134 its a wonderful day for jamaica and you have done us proud it was a stunning performance and we are so proud of you
4989135 the games are not yet over and we expect a lot more from the team in the day ahead but i can assure you that we are planning a massive welcome home party for all of you
4989136 it is unbelievable people were jumping in their chairs the only place left for them to jump on were the tables the spirit was very strong
4989137 two or more persons diagnosed with a particular disease from the same house or village
4989138 this is a usual situation for us every year and the population is becoming scared everybody who now thinks they have a fever is rushing to the hospital and that is why there are no beds ten to 15 sick persons are now left without a bed and the media is adding to it
4989139 they said that dengue does not have a cure and that all they have to take are antibiotics what kind of treatment are people getting in the hospital
4989140 falsely misleading the public of trinidad and tobago on what is obviously an outbreak of dengue and for his lack of proper management of his ministry
4989141 the way things are done especially in the fact that people are losing their jobs there are a lot of things an employer can say to justify why an individual is fired so they will never come directly and say why
4989142 just mere gossip has gotten people put out of homes i have seen people put out of places they were renting because a neighbour told a landlord that person was accessing treatment for hiv they dont know that for sure
4989143 the human rights of hiv positive people is not supported by the laws of tt
4989144 it was just a rumour that her mother and father were hiv positive the parents of children at the pre school got together and said they would take their children out of the school the manager was asked for the child to be put out
4989145 what form of redress is there for the mother there is nothing in place for redress for the mother the teacher owner of the school could say something else
4989146 no matter how she tried to explain to the doctor attached to the company that it was her medication he could not see it because it was not known
4989147 in them saying it was marijuana that was their reason for her getting fired they didnt directly say she was fired because she was hiv positive
4989148 there is no redress for people to step up who is going to champion the cause for these people where are they going to get to do this to make sure things are done properly many people get fed up and say to hell with it and try something else
4989149 i hope we can have certain things in place especially where job related policy is concerned and include hiv positive persons who knows better how to live with hiv who can tell what the rigours of life is like
4989150 he had just put his foot forward to cross when this vehicle came speeding down the road i tried to pull him back but it was too late his foot with his shoes was cut off and left behind as the car dragged his body some distance away the driver was trying to beat the traffic light and just couldnt stop

4989152 ubbidendo a un impulso improvviso si sporse verso di lui e gli diede un rapido bacio sulle labbra quando sfior la bocca di seth il suo cuore fu travolto da un terromoto di emozioni le pulsazioni del suo cuore avevano assunto un ritmo incontrollato e tutto il suo corpo vibrava per lemozione
4989153 having added strength up front is a situation i really enjoy
4989154 ideally i like to operate with four experienced strikers as we did when we won the treble when we had andy cole dwight yorke teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer
4989155 it was an admirable strength to have when it came to the end of the season and we were competing on three fronts with key games coming at us thick and fast
4989156 if our plans do not come to fruition it is hardly the end of the road

4989162 you know it was just a wierd game they scored two goals in the first five minutes of the game and we just couldnt catch up after that but it was kind of a wake up call and weve done an extremely good job of coming together and finding ways to win
4989163 i think the adversity has made us stronger weve had to come together and figure things out and try different things and im extremely proud of how weve come together as a unit and found ways to win so far
4989164 it was an amazing feeling i had so many emotions running through me at the time i didnt realize but that goal helped us advance first in our group which was huge for us
4989165 i think the biggest thing for us is having fun along the way were out here training we know what to do we know theres a semi final for the olympics tomorrow but at the same time were enjoying where were at we just moved into the village and theres just so much excitement and so much energy and so many things going on i think well soak that up and control the things we can control and hopefully well come out on top
4989166 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
4989167 that was amazing who said 13 was an unlucky number weve got rid of that one
4989168 before the race we sat down and said we wanted to come here and win this we have worked all this year and last year the last 10 years and it comes down to six and a half minutes or so of hell but with a fantastic result its unbelievable
4989169 it is going to be hard coming to terms with another silver
4989170 we always said that silver wouldnt be good enough for us
4989171 i am so proud to race with this crew we felt so strong in the last 500 but we just werent able to latch it together most of the race we were the best crew but not at the end
4989172 i would have walked because it was something that was actually ok walking i havent made the injury worse
4989173 if i felt i was doing some serious damage i would have stopped its horrible when you have to drop out especially when its the olympic games so many people have worked so hard to get me here
4989174 in some ways its almost quicker to keep going because if you stop youre just left out there on your own
4989175 they couldnt have been better conditions when i started to struggle i got a lot of traffic and that was annoying i was getting lots of fumes as well as everything else
4989176 a pain came up into my calves it wasnt a sharp pain if it had been like when the stress fracture was bad i would just have stopped i felt like i was just running on one leg
4989177 i wanted to finish it was really frustrating because i felt really comfortable i could talk and tell husband gary what was wrong
4989178 my calf was just so bad i had to stretch it the pain felt like it was coming up from my foot early in the race i had this weird feeling that someone was kicking my foot away while i was running
4989179 im really happy with sixth a medal would have been nice but sixth is the best british performance and im glad i ran a sensible race i dug in at the end but they were just a bit too strong for me
4989180 ive trained in much harder conditions im surprised a lot of other people didnt do better
4989181 to finally get there get some great breeze and to win the race after two or three years of hard work means its all been worth it im a happy man
4989182 its pretty good going to have four medals but the draw of 2012 on home waters is huge
4989183 im lost for words it is such a relief our experience was everything we stayed sure and we got better
4989184 its been brilliant this campaign has been about pure perfection and were just an awesome team
4989185 fourth in the olympic games is just not good enough fourth is not the place to come my time would have got me a medal in the individual and im gutted i didnt do it
4989186 im trying not to be upset its been a great experience being here in the next four years the relay team is going to be phenomenal and next time well get them
4989187 i had expectations for the 400m freestyle but this is a great surprise
4989188 i felt good in the first 400m at 800m and 900m i started believing i could win
4989189 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100m to save energy and attack in the final 50m
4989190 the event has changed and everybody is going to have to re think their strategies its basically a 1500m sprint its unbelievable
4989191 i knew the 36 hours in between would be a race to recover and i did everything i could but in the end it was really telling on me
4989192 the elephants and pianos were all on my shoulders and my heart was pounding and my stomach was gone and its a long way when youre feeling like that
4989193 to have done what ive done to become an olympic champion puts you on a different level to everyone else
4989194 i was thinking in the olympic village when youre one of the best athletes in the country it feels like youre good at something
4989195 but then you go and mix it up with 6000 of the best athletes in the world and youre nothing unless you become olympic champion
4989196 new new new new new new new new new new
4989197 the term spitzian might be outdated now by the phelpsian feat
4989198 it will always be an amazing accomplishment in the swimming world and also the olympics being able to have something like that to shoot for it made those days when you were tired and didnt want to be there when you just wanted to go home and sleep through the workout it made those days easier id look at him and say well i want to do this its something ive wanted to do and im thankful for having him do what he did
4989199 in an era of such great swimmers i think watching phelps win eight gold medals has been my highlight
4989200 i just dont think there is a perspective for him
4989201 hes beyond everything we know in athens when he was going for eight golds i said it would never happen not in this day and age with semifinal swims and the competition level phelps has taken every expectation and broken it he seems to be the only guy who sees the impossible as possible and thats what makes him the best once he crosses the threshold other people are able to foresee it happening if he can do it we can do it but hes always one step ahead of us
4989202 i thought he would win six or seven but with a little bit of luck hed probably get eight

4989221 the people of georgia have cast their lot with the free world and we will not cast them aside
4989222 im not especially hopeful that they will reverse their decision to close the flight attendant base
4989223 we wanted to let them know some of the concerns we had air canadas view is that closing flight bases in winnipeg and halifax is a good economic decision i took some issue with that and urged them to reconsider
4989224 we didnt come up and try to buy the jobs so to speak
4989225 i spoke with my counterpart in nova scotia and theyre taking the same position
4989226 to me a human life matters whether black or white beautiful or ugly tall or short rich or poor jew or christian or muslim or atheist sane or insane these are just labels that set us apart all have human dignity there would be no prejudice if we celebrated our similarities we all share and crave love and acceptance for who we are not as someone wants us to be it is difficult to reach out to another to love another without first loving ourselves everyone has a toothache and baggage and it keeps our love from emanating out to another person and up into the universe but when you come to realize that all we have on this earth is our time and our integrity and that we are here to serve each other we all have the capacity to become like mother teresa serving one person at a time one person hurting with a toothache at a time and it could be our spouse our child our neighbor our paper boy or that complete stranger standing over in the corner alone
4989227 of all i have received or given my daughter is the most precious of all having a family is the only gift i have ever given myself as i reflect back i often feel i will have passed through failing to have done anything worthy to deserve one line in the eons of history by many i may be remembered as a real estate agent but i want to be remembered as having given life to a child my life has been empty and meaningless until i reflect on my daughter and her mother my wife my daughter collins gave meaning to my brief tenure on this planet
4989228 how lucky i am to have found charlyn and to have chosen her out of all the choices i could have made there is no doubt i made the right choice
4989229 though i know exactly where my mother wants to be buried and that my father cringes at the thought of his body suffocating entombed in the ground we have not often spoken about death as a family i think that my father almost died in the hospital this past week and the abruptness with which i was reminded of his impending premature death struck with full force a lung transplant could extend his life another ten or fifteen years but the failure of such a major surgery seems to present the possibility of picking ones own date to die we sat huddled in the living room my mom and i on the floor my dad in his favorite chair with the dog on his lap crying grieving and finally talking about the decision that we that my father has to make
4989230 okay that all sounds fine now what can you do about my nose
4989231 dear donor family not too many people on this earth get a second chance at life i did because of a compassionate caring person in your family i was told before the surgery a new lung would improve the quality of my life but perhaps not the quantity i am so thankful to be alive for however long god grants me life i promise you i will honor your gift with my last breath thanksgiving now has a whole different meaning to me i was called to university of colorado hospital on november 23rd at 9 30 pm the surgery from 3 00 am to 8 00 am on thanksgiving put me on the road to a new life only a week before my wife was concerned i would never see 2006 after struggling for breath for ten long years especially the last six months where i had to concentrate on each breath i took the first step in the icu without supplemental oxygen was worth the struggle i now find enormous gratification in the smallest most elemental pleasures taking my first shower after surgery was heavenly waking up in my hospital bed before dawn to the most beautiful winter landscape i have ever experienced living in colorado walking at dawn in washington park when it is still so peaceful with only the soft nuzzling sounds of the geese still snoozing and a few eager squirrels darting about sharing the experience with an occasional jogger or an early riser like myself i find myself weeping for no reason at all except in finding pure joy in my new life thanks to someone who cared enough to become a donor i weep for your family in your loss what a courageous and compassionate gesture to offer part of oneself so that someone might live we are a very active family who enjoy colorado to the fullest we hiked jogged biked swam skied and traveled together until i was about fifty four when i went on oxygen twenty four hours a day since 1996 i missed so many wonderful experiences with my family but i encouraged them not to quit doing the things we once enjoyed together many times my wife and daughter came home from a hike in tears because i was not able to share in some wonderful experience they had encountered that day well now i have nothing to hold me back and a lot to look forward to at age sixty three i feel like i am twenty again in honor of the gift from your family i am exercising daily in anticipation of hiking and the many other things i can enjoy with healthy lungs i will continue to honor my lung as long as i am able by doing my part to keep your gift alive by giving back to pay the good fortune forward and to spread the word of this blessing i will always keep your loved one and your family who gave me a second chance at life in my prayers sincerely and gratefully yours dean

4989264 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since aug 7
4989265 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4989266 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4989267 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4989293 made by the wachowski brothers and joel silver of matrix fame
4989294 we can be sure that the wachowski brothers were referencing the order out of chaos system since at one point in the film the opressive english parliment gets frustrated that their society is embracing the terrorist acts against them and decides to begin committing terrorist acts under the guise of v in order to turn the people against him and again embrace their oppressive form of government police state they even unleash a biological virus on their people in the film killing almost 100 000 people and if the history of terrorism in literature and cinema is any indicator you should probably mind your hygeine habits in the coming years because as exhibited below several times in recent years terrorist acts have been depicted almost exactly as they go down in entertainment sold to us beforehand
4989295 as for anyone who scoffs at the notion that government connected interests could be planting depictions of terrorism in hollywood that isnt the allegation the more realistic notion is that such interests have been made privy to certain plotlines and then decide to preempt them in real life to affect how you see their portrayal upon release of the entertainment material
4989296 but perhaps that is the desired goal by the powers that be to push americans until they fight back and really give you a pretext to lay on the police state thick since the outcome of another staged attack like 9 11 really cannot be gauged considering the growth in the population who are not so sure 9 11 is what they thought it was anymore if an attack were to occur tomorrow i dont believe theyre certain they can sell us on their version of it and i believe that scares them
4989297 yeah look killing civilians not cool even if you think they belong to you knock it the feck off or were going to kick your ass
4989298 hahaha whatre you going to do we own nd you cant do sheeeet huzzah
4989299 most of you numb nuts are from the south where did youre balls go no wonder why you lost the civil war you were a bunch of pussies then and you are now
4989300 and to that idiot who said that there was in fact too much water snow icecaps so god could flood the world and wipe out humanity well thats not a loving all caring god that i choose to worship
4989301 as for creationism thats not science its stand up comedy
4989302 astrophysics has precious little overlap with evolutionary biology this is why they are different disciplines the clue is in them having different names and being in different departments in the science building of your local campus im sure that if you went to a school that taught science you would also have noticed that the physics teacher and the biology teacher were two separate people one may have been a woman the other may have had a moustache
4989303 a study on 101 software engineers referred as subjects like in munnabhai mbbs a famous hindi film conducted in japan has following observations physical complaints were observed in 68 of the subjects with 25 of the subjects complaining of physical ill health this study showed that 12 of the subjects had hypertension 12 gastritis or gastro duodenal ulcer 14 allergic disease and 19 miscellaneous diseases of the subjects 62 had mental complaints and 31 mental ill health depressive symptom was the most frequent mental complaint with 32 of the subjects diagnosed as dsm iii the common diagnoses were adjustment disorders 19 major affective disorders 6 psychological factors affecting physical condition 5 and dysthymic disorder 3 only one subject sought professional help from a psychiatrist for relief of mental complaints
4989304 in a study conducted in silicon city of india which covered 1 749 employees at 19 outsourcing companies about 32 percent of respondents complained of sleep disorders 25 percent had digestive troubles and 20 percent reported eyesight problems
4989305 six software professionals under the age of 33 have died and 2 top executives from renowned software companies have become paralyzed because of stress related heart ailments in the last six months in chennai says a study by mitran foundation a bangalore based voluntary association of practicing doctors all the six who died and the two who became invalid had no family history of heart attacks or any pre history of heart ailments or paralysis they were all in their prime between 27 and 33 years and handled challenging projects at work in their respective companies they worked long and continuous hours the end struck them very suddenly and it looked as if their hearts refused to take any more stress
4989306 why do employees need to work so many hours the key is that management does not view employee time as a scarce resource
4989307 there is no reason to remake something that is absolutely perfect

4989309 la giornata servir anche e soprattutto a far conoscere e a far aderire lopinione pubblica alle nostre proposte proposte che sono delle alternative valide tecnicamente economicamente e socialmente per qualsiasi paese civile
4989310 we should keep doing things the same way without trying any less or more than before
4989311 iraqis use a strange incomprehensible series of meaningless phonemes to communicate needless to say its very difficult to understand
4989312 iraqis may communicate much more efficiently with a language like english which is easy to learn and use
4989313 there may in fact be no one iraqi language but they may even speak a number of different strange languages if you can believe that all the more reason for them to standardize on the english language for their own use
4989314 while the findings are still highly theoretical its still a very big leap
4989315 imagine these cloned pigs drafting and voting on legislation in an all ungulate congress
4989316 believe it or not we think this technology is not that far off
4989317 i understand how some americans have had their confidence shaken
4989318 however they should know that the next several years of the war will be just as bogus and tragic
4989319 decisions regarding future calamity and ineptitude will be made by future presidents and iraqi leaders
4989320 this is a sham and i do not accept it
4989321 however research has shown that virtually all activities in alabama are in some way aided and abetted by alcohol
4989322 the plan is to have the iraqi security forces deal with it to the extent they are able to
4989323 the us forces will provide only logistical and aerial support
4989324 then after all the laughter had settled we started to wonder were these church burnings illegal thats when we started our investigation
4989325 we all know how jokes can get out of hand leading to farcical episodes or in this case deliberate arson
4989326 it does not remain clear whether the judge will take this into account during sentencing or parole
4989327 any continutation of this dangerous cheese enrichment program will lead to meaningful consequences
4989328 with countless sectarian quasi terrorist factions tearing the families apart the ubiquitous melancholy is quite palpable
4989329 you know that in some families some brothers fight for one quasi terrorist sectarian faction while another will fight for a different quasi terrorist sectarian faction
4989330 we prefer the term war between the countless quasi terrorist sectarian factions
4989331 i am reasonably certain that these countless warring terrorist factions will see each other as liberators
4989332 nixons approval rating was as low as 24 percent yet he must have survived somehow
4989333 and with new technology were getting better and better at knowing whos guilty and who isnt every day
4989334 they could physically punch through those walls if they wanted to
4989335 the family of cliff mccoy donated it to us the walls and windows are original and we built a new roof and floor
4989336 it could be something like someone building a deck and they want something around it or something just to spruce up the yard

4989349 how to uninstall the adobe flash player plug in and activex control

4989353 in our experiments we explore couplings between atoms in proteins
4989354 our goal is to translate genomic information into high resolution structural information and thereby be able to better understand the function of the proteins
4989355 with increased speed and sensitivity we can obtain very high resolution spectra
4989356 and because we can resolve thousands of signals at a time one for each atom in the sample we can determine the structure of the entire protein
4989357 using this technique we can more precisely define the fragments of the molecule and how they are oriented
4989358 that allows us to define protein features and determine structure at the atomic scale
4989359 can i be the 57th person to suggest that gary naylor is mistaking diouf somehow for patrick berger who did score two on his debut for liverpool
4989360 surely top prize among the bright but fading foreign sparks brigade has to go to stilyan petrov whose debut against the kit stealers had villa fans in something of a lather
4989361 fast forward two mediocrity filled years and most of them would happily give petrov a good lathering
4989362 re overseas signings impressing from the off didnt el haji diouf score a brace on his debut for liverpool in 2002
4989363 his must be within spitting distance of the best overseas debut
4989364 we have copied nature taking the elements and mechanisms found in plant life that have evolved over 3 billion years and recreated one of those processes in the laboratory
4989365 a manganese cluster is central to a plants ability to use water carbon dioxide and sunlight to make carbohydrates and oxygen man made mimics of this cluster were developed by professor charles dismukes some time ago and weve taken it a step further harnessing the ability of these molecules to convert water into its component elements oxygen and hydrogen
4989366 the breakthrough came when we coated a proton conductor called nafion onto an anode to form a polymer membrane just a few micrometres thick which acts as a host for the manganese clusters
4989367 normally insoluble in water when we bound the catalyst within the pores of the nafion membrane it was stabilised against decomposition and importantly water could reach the catalyst where it was oxidised on exposure to light
4989368 whilst man has been able to split water into hydrogen and oxygen for years we have been able to do the same thing for the first time using just sunlight an electrical potential of 1 2 volts and the very chemical that nature has selected for this purpose
4989369 we need to continue to learn from nature so that we can better master this process
4989370 hydrogen has long been considered the ideal clean green fuel energy rich and carbon neutral the production of hydrogen using nothing but water and sunlight offers the possibility of an abundant renewable green source of energy for the future for communities across the world
4989371 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4989372 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4989373 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4989374 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4989375 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4989376 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4989377 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4989378 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4989379 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4989380 but when i read the history i said to myself this is such a community asset and community presence
4989381 with 229 artists you can imagine that we had a lot of ideas
4989382 we already had our two shows a year the spring catalogue show and the fall show and that was great but we needed to do more
4989383 we wanted to acknowledge excellence and encourage excellence in our membership and the art community which led to our third area of focus professional development encouraging buffalo artists at whatever level they are at to move forward in their practice and in their career this also meant business development
4989384 hey we have over 200 small businesses here in the society and the model should be as exporters because while some of the market for their product is in our area much of it is in other areas of the country we ve been looking at gaining an economic development grant if the artists become successful exporters of their work they are bringing revenue back into this area which they then spend in this area so it is indeed economic development
4989385 in larger markets such as toronto baltimore cleveland pittsburgh we are more likely to find our niche the potential is there but we havent tapped it yet and if we are going to be anything we need to be supporting our members in moving forward
4989386 art in this city is relatively cheap the same piece in a larger market would easily sell for three times as much americans will spend a great deal of money on their wardrobes cars lawns and on redoing their house and new carpets but will then put cheap prints on their walls
4989387 this is an education issue that probably goes back to arts being pulled out of schools and people not having appreciation or knowing the role of art or seeing the advantage of it in many ways art has become commodified to the point of being just an investment and people dont realize the qualitative value of art
4989388 with the society we have traditional painters and are drawing in more conceptual artists i would love the dialogue to challenge both sides of the equation the conceptual artists to consider technique and aesthetics in expressing their ideas but also the traditional artists to be challenged in terms of asking the question what am i really saying what is this besides a nice landscape or still life metaphor is extremely important not that everything needs to become narrative but we learn a great deal about how the universe works by narrative being connected to the universe in both a spiritual and physical sense is what art is really a metaphor for it takes the immaterial and makes it material
4989389 that is always the difficult thing keeping it cohesive i think that fact that we are moving forward and that we have differences of opinion that excite people oddly enough if we can manage that it can have a cohesive effect as opposed to the fragmenting effect that it had in the 30s with the patteran dialogue is important not camps one of my priorities is promoting dialogue
4989390 were still behind the curve but moving forward digital image makers of art are now part of the society and we are looking toward drawing in a working partnership with squeaky wheel to jury video art
4989391 we also need to be looking at affecting and helping the community to appreciate art and showing them the high quality of the local artists part of the focus is looking toward what do we want to do educationally in providing workshops or seminars or panels
4989392 the winners got digital cameras and printers it was a great program to read what the kids wrote about why they shot what they shot brought tears to our eyes
4989393 the bsa doesnt exist in a vacuum cooperation with other arts organizations has been key community service has been key

4989430 john mccain is a strong christian but he believes that in the context of the campaign his faith is a personal issue
4989431 the mccain campaign can not be satisfied with thinking evangelicals and conservative faith voters will vote for mccain as long as they thoroughly demonize obama it wont work
4989432 while some christian voters seem to be questioning their early support for obama the mccain candidacy does not seem to be gaining momentum among evangelicals but if the current preferences stand pat this would mark the first time in more than two decades that the born again vote has swung toward the democratic candidate
4989433 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness

4989463 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4989464 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4989465 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4989466 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers

4989488 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

4989494 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4989495 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4989496 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4989497 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4989498 who are open to doing something on the production side
4989499 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4989500 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4989501 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4989502 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4989503 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4989504 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4989505 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4989506 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4989507 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4989508 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4989509 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4989510 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4989511 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4989512 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4989513 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4989514 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

4989521 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4989522 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4989523 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4989524 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4989525 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4989526 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4989527 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4989528 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4989529 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4989530 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4989531 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4989532 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4989533 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4989534 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4989535 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4989536 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4989537 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4989538 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4989539 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4989540 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4989541 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4989542 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4989543 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4989544 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4989545 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4989546 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4989547 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4989548 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4989549 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4989550 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4989551 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4989552 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4989553 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4989554 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4989555 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4989556 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4989557 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4989558 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4989559 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4989560 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4989561 ellen degeneres and portia de rossi were married tonight in an intimate ceremony at their home in los angeles
4989562 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4989563 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4989564 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4989565 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4989566 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4989567 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4989568 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4989573 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4989574 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4989575 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4989576 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4989577 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4989578 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4989579 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4989580 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4989581 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

4989617 in the meantime we have managed to instill in them the legacy of the few against the many and the spirit of massada we were in the midst of teaching them the commission of inquiry and cover your own ass mentality when the fighting suddenly broke out with no prior intelligence warning well at least we still managed to instill that

4989660 you dont see the stuff behind the scenes hes a great teammate
4989661 this couldnt have happened to her so close to the finish line and just to be like that it must have been horrific for her out there
4989662 i may have to say no actually i was last
4989663 so when it happened on kilometer 39 with two miles to go i thought for sure i was done i thought there was no way i never felt pain like that running in my whole life i dont understand what happened i was drinking every station i was taking three gels i dont understand why i got such bad cramps
4989664 when i was sitting there looking at the stadium and i just couldnt move because it was just pulling so strong i didnt think i was going to finish the race
4989665 i said to myself even if it takes me a half an hour i just have to give myself a chance to finish
4989666 that was probably the most magical moment of my whole olympics
4989667 i went through that gate knowing that whatever happens i have only one lap to go and i will finish this race that i think was the first time that i really believed i was going to finish
4989668 jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him
4989669 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4989670 that basic principle applies to poverty it applies to racism and sexism it applies to you know not having not thinking about providing ladders of opportunity for people to get into the middle class
4989671 all of a sudden the door of the cell opened the guard came in he loosened the ropes
4989672 and i was standing outside for my few minutes outside my cell
4989673 he came walking up he stood there for a minute and with his handle on the dirt in the courtyard he drew a cross and he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away for a minute there there was just two christians worshipping together
4989674 my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective or a different view
4989675 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4989676 when i find myself taking the wrong step i think a lot of times its because im trying to protect myself instead of do gods work
4989677 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4989678 kita sudah tahu bahwa cabai bersifat antibakteri dan anti jamur yang bisa menjadi salah satu alasan mengapa manusia mengkonsumsinya tewksbury dan rekan rekannya telah melakukan penelitian yang sangat menarik dengan menunjukkan bahwa di alam panas capsaicinoid cabai melindungi buahnya dari invasi jamur sehingga bukan hanya manusia yang mengambil manfaat dari capsaicinoid tetapi juga memberi manfaat bagi tanaman cabai itu sendiri
4989679 theres been a few doubters and hopefully ive proved a few wrong
4989680 it doesnt really bother me to be honest i see pre season as a time to get match fit
4989681 it was a very open game and i think both teams wanted to attack like us crewe wanted to get the ball down and play and it was a very entertaining game
4989682 i dont think it means too much at this stage of the season
4989683 its always nice to start well last year we drew our opening game then followed that with a win so we have already improved on that
4989684 we didnt know about that statistic but obviously it is nice to achieve something like that
4989685 we broke a club record for consecutive home wins last season so its nice to be part of something like that
4989686 after last year when we went out of all the competitions early i think it is important we get a decent run this season to go along with a good league season

4989755 the campaign will also include cleaning up of the yamuna river and its tributaries how can we clean up ganga without cleaning up the yamuna first
4989756 this is a not a political campaign the threat posed by the pollution of ganga cuts across party lines and we want all political parties to join the campaign
4989757 the dam will collapse one of these days and the entire eco system along the catchment area of the tehri river its tributaries and the ganga will be jeopardised resulting in a natural disaster
4989758 there is a possibility of heavy rainfall or thundershowers in the next 24 hours the indian meteorological department imd said sunday afternoon
4989759 all my plans for the evening are shattered with this rain maybe now we will sit at home and settle for tea and snacks
4989760 thank god its sunday otherwise this rain would have again led to very heavy traffic snarls like i faced last week when i reached home after three hours instead of one
4989761 the situation is better as it is raining in only some parts of the city whereas last week rain had made the traffic crawl on the delhi gurgaon expressway it took me three hours to reach the india gate from gurgaon

4989766 i probably would have done better if i would have had that mentality to begin with there were some times when i stopped wrestling today and i paid for it

4989768 i hoped to win any medal bronze silver or gold
4989769 for students of history the manner in which the second world war ended is even more fascinating than that in which it began giants of their respective nations or rather mortal men cast into giants roles resolved the great issues of the twentieth century on battlefields in three dimensions and in the war rooms of their capitals some of the most populous societies on earth teemed in flux technology displayed a terrifying maturity for millions 1944 45 brought liberation the banishment of privation fear and oppression but air attacks during those years killed larger numbers of people than in the rest of the conflict put together posterity knows that the war ended in august 1945 however it would have provided scant comfort to the men who risked their lives in the pacific island battles as well as in the other bloody campaigns of that spring and summer to be assured that the tumult would soon be stilled soldiers may accept a need to be the first to die in a war but there is often an unseemly scramble to avoid becoming the last

4989771 herr labbadia ihr deb t als bundesliga trainer endete mit einer 2 3 heimniederlage gegen borussia dortmund wie entt uscht sind sie
4989772 die entt uschung ist sehr sehr gro wir haben fu ballerisch berzeugt immer an uns geglaubt und zahlreiche chancen gehabt aber das ist alles makulatur wir haben null punkte das ist sehr sehr rgerlich wenn so ein aufwand nicht belohnt wird denn so gut kann man nicht immer spielen
4989773 w rden sie sagen dass ihre junge mannschaft lehrgeld gezahlt hat
4989774 wir haben eine sehr junge mannschaft aber das darf man nicht als ausrede benutzen daf r haben wir den fr hen r ckstand auch einfach zu gut weggesteckt wir haben nur manchmal die falsche wahl getroffen und das hat dortmund dreimal ausgenutzt
4989775 sie sind also mit der leistung zufrieden aber nicht mit dem ergebnis wie gehen sie nun mit der mannschaft um
4989776 man muss die mannschaft jetzt aufbauen aber das ist schwierig weil mir neun spieler fehlen die bei ihren nationalteams weilen ich pers nlich finde es sehr ungl cklich schon so fr h in der saison l nderspiele anzusetzen da sollte man auch mal ein bisschen an die trainer denken gerade in einem jahr wo die vorbereitung durch die em ohnehin sehr schwierig ist
4989777 constant djakpa hat defensiv manche schw chen gezeigt wir wollten ihn langsam aufbauen aber da uns v llig die alternativen fehlen mussten wir ihn ins kalte wasser werfen renato augusto hat mir sehr gut gefallen patrick helmes hat ein tor gemacht aber er h tte weitere machen k nnen normalerweise ist er eiskalt wenn er seine chancen heute besser nutzt gehen wir als sieger vom platz

4989796 the chief threat in the region i see right now is the threat to saudi arabia by iran and al qaeda if al qaeda were to overthrow the present royal family in saudi arabia or attack the strait of hormuz cutting off the oil supply to western nations including japan and china it would bring down entire world economies france and germany would be begging us to go to war to retake those oil wells it would be world war iii
4989797 france and the european economies would collapse in a matter of weeks
4989798 another looming concern is iran which wants to develop nuclear weapons to couple with their shahab 4 5 amp 6 missiles on the drawing boards which have a range to hit london israel all of europe southern russia and the united states also the iranian government has said it initially had 300 centrifuges to enrich uranium to weapons grade material they have increased that to 3 000 they will soon increase that again to 10 000 centrifuges
4989799 they have the additional capacity to add another 20 000 centrifuges in mass production techniques that will enable them to produce at least seven nuclear bombs in about a year where did they get these centrifuges
4989800 they probably got them from saddam hussein before the iraq war started and were probably smuggled out of iraq and into iran just like he did his air force of 600 soviet fighter planes in other words he gave them to his former enemy rather than let them be destroyed on the ground
4989801 why would he have done any differently with the 30 000 centrifuges he supposedly had on a decentralized basis inside iraq before the war
4989802 isnt it strange that iran could come up with a nuclear weapons program in about six months to a year when it took the united states six years under the manhattan project with 5 000 of the worlds most brilliant scientists like robert oppenheimer niels bohr seaborg einstein fermi and others working on it
4989803 it is time for the israelis and palestinians to return to the peace talks resume where they left off and
4989804 and its all related to the palestinian israeli conflict which i said back in 1987 was the crux of my book it always has been and always will be until its settled
4989805 that linkage is exactly what osama bin laden stated in a taped message aired the weekend before the election in november of 2004 whether you believe him or not is beside the point thats whats he told us and wed better take that into account
4989806 its like a marriage where both spouses storm away mad in an argument they dont divorce and then try to resume their relationship they come back together settle their differences and resume their marriage it must be the same for the middle east peace talks
4989807 the book is absolutely stunning in the manner in which mr spirko tells his tale he is truly a master as an analyst and its totally unlike anything else weve ever read in a spy thriller it keeps you turning pages and wont let you quit until the very end and what an ending it is if you crave twisting plots thrilling spy action and intriguing characters then this is the book for you
4989808 if books were rated by siskel amp roeper it would be given a two thumbs up
4989809 i shot a great match its just a crazy thing that happens
4989810 just worrying about calming myself down and just breaking a good shot and so i didnt even look at the number
4989811 the way i come into a target is i start above the target and come down from 12 oclock and get into the
4989812 and as i get down into the is when i start to get on the trigger
4989813 as i was starting to get on the trigger the gun just went off
4989814 i was like uh thats not going to be good
4989815 hes definitely the best standing shooter out there if he can still end up fourth with a 4 4 on the last shot thats a hell of a shooter
4989816 hearing the spectators cheering i felt maybe i got the silver but my coach told me i got the gold
4989817 i said that last time and its the truth maybe last time the reason was katy this time i dont know yet but im sure something goods going to come from it

4989822 je moet niet presteren altijd op jezelf betrekken als trainer
4989823 ik heb een aantal mensen tijdens het trainingskamp sneller zien zwemmen dan bij de wedstrijden in peking dan kan ik maar n conclusie trekken we hebben verkeerd gepiekt en daar ben ik verantwoordelijk voor
4989824 van pieter weet ik hoe hij reageert en hoe hij naar de wedstrijd toe nog beter kan worden inge is duidelijk niet in vorm verkeerd gepiekt marleen vind ik nog een twijfelgeval zij zwom vandaag op de 50 vrij goed alleen haar tijd was niet goed genoeg
4989825 met pieter ben ik al jaren gewend aan een bepaalde wedstrijdspecifieke voorbereiding die hem nog een stukje beter maakt tijdens het toernooi maar pieter is inge niet en pieter is marleen niet in plaats van dat het hen het laatste stukje voorwaarts bracht ging het een stukje achterwaarts na hongkong het is het verschil van een week misschien anderhalve week ik had beter moeten weten ik heb een inschattingsfout gemaakt en een verkeerde beslissing genomen
4989826 nee ik heb geen mentale problemen gezien of concentratieproblemen daar ligt het niet aan
4989827 ik vind dat wij nog steeds een goede groep hebben ik heb geen overspannen mensen gezien maar als het resultaat niet goed is moet ik als trainer naar de trainingen gaan kijken het randgebeuren was perfect het is echt niet zo dat het roer nu helemaal om moet dat is paniekvoetbal en daar is geen enkele reden toe het zit m in de details
4989828 dan is een vijfde plaats heel erg teleurstellend dan is er toch iets niet goed gegaan blijkbaar heb ik niet de absolute topvorm

4989835 five people have died after a mid air collision between two light aircraft in warwickshire
4989836 west midlands ambulance service was called to a location near coombe abbey at brinklow at 11 42 this morning one aircraft came down close to coventry road between brinklow and coventry
4989837 one person was confirmed dead at the scene the second came down in brandon woods four people were confirmed dead at the scene
4989838 the suspect then left the scene but returned a little while later and was again involved in an exchange of words with the victim and his friends which resulted in the victim being injured
4989839 there is nothing to suggest at this early stage that the incident was gang related
4989840 we really need to trace the driver of the cab as he may hold the key to the identity of the suspect
4989841 also anyone who saw a disturbance in sumner road is asked to please contact police
4989842 its not known at this time what the argument was about either with the cab driver or the group but anyone with information about the incident should call us

4989862 the people who carried out this attack were clearly looking to kill members of the police service they have nothing to offer northern ireland in 2008 they still believe that they are living at the height of the troubles while everybody else has moved forward and left violence behind
4989863 i hope the officers make a speedy recovery and show that those behind the attack will not hold us to ransom
4989864 i am very pleased to announce that dr kumar kamble will be the alliance party candidate in next months enniskillen by election dr kamble is a prominent figure who is held in very high regard by the community he serves in the erne hospital
4989865 its very important that the people of enniskillen are given the chance to vote for a party and a candidate that appeals to everyone not just one side or another the tribal parties are failing at stormont the dup and sinn fein are simply not working the stormont executive has not met since mid june and will not meet until mid september this election gives people the opportunity to say that they are not happy with this situation
4989866 it is a great honour to have been selected to represent alliance at the forthcoming by election enniskillen needs a councillor who will work for everyone in the area not simply for one of the two tribes
4989867 there are a number of key issues that i will be campaigning on
4989868 i will also be campaigning to ensure that the gridlock which can be seen around enniskillen most days is alleviated i will be working hard to provide improved public transport for the town and the outlying areas better and more frequent bus services will encourage people to get out of their cars and this will make enniskillen a far easier place to get around
4989869 given the extent of the flooding last year one would have hoped that the executive would have formulated a stronger strategy to deal with flooding alarmingly it appears that they did not

4989875 character and integrity in this case rise above party and process and we felt that mark given his circumstances in life specifically his conviction for spousal abuse really didnt pass the test if you will for the kind of candidate we wanted

4989879 hmm how in this case seems you are trying to go against what so called no one is perfect
4989880 ok lets see being imperfect is one of the attributes of human beings do you agree
4989881 the meaning of being perfect is fulfilling certain criteria or having some kind of attributes what something someone is expected to have isnt it
4989882 by being imperfect we have fulfilled one of the criteria of being a human being so we can define perfection for human beings by having an attribute of being imperfect

4989907 i didnt want it to happen that i would play completely bad and somebody would pick up number one in the world so i think rafa totally deserves it

4989959 aargg what the fuck do i want to do now
4989960 well it is not my fault that we always go in bars or for coffee
4989961 well you know that at anytime you want to go to a club you can go without me i dont prevent you from going out to the places you want to go by not joining you why do you come with us then when we go for coffee bars if thats not what you want
4989962 omg how can you handle that if i were you id probably stay at home forever
4989963 perhaps they think that pensioners will attack one another with the playing cards
4989964 freebridge claim the insurance is a matter of course but you cant tell me every group meeting needs public liability insurance they are just trying to cover their own backs we should not have to pay for that
4989965 they dont understand why they cant have their friends over to play cards
4989966 its health and safety gone mad and it is short sighted of freebridge
4989967 we wont be using the room in the future well find somewhere that already has the insurance in place
4989968 its disgusting that freebridge is more concerned about making sure no one could ever sue them than ensuring their residents have a good quality of living
4989969 how on earth is someone going to injure themselves whilst playing cards
4989970 freebridge community housing actively promotes the use of its community rooms as the social interaction of its elderly residents and people from the local community is a positive contribution to their lives
4989971 it is general practice that any room hire includes a requirement for insurance
4989972 this can be covered by the group club insurance or could form part of the hire cost
4989973 the requirement has been in place for many years but as freebridge has recently updated the hire agreement it is checking that groups have their own insurance in place
4989974 i am surprised mr corbett has been quoted 500 for insurance and freebridge will make enquiries with our own insurance company to see if alternative quotes are more competitive

4989980 we believe this modelling might not be fit for purpose and we want to check it
4989981 we have a finite amount of money to spend on healthcare and we have to divide it up in as fair and as equitable a way as we can we cant say to yes to everything its awkward its difficult its unpleasant
4989982 a fragmenting culture where our certainties of even a few decades ago are questioned and where it is common for young men and women who have had years of education to know nothing of the world

4989993 if it works it could reverse the disease and stop further episodes
4989994 based on previous laboratory research we would expect that this will specifically suppress or down regulate the auto immune response
4989995 compared to the money that the government is giving to the palestinian authority this is an insult i would throw this back in their faces if the government was seriously interested in a programme to foster academic cooperation it would think in terms of millions
4989996 morally acceptable to continue links with israeli institutions where there was evidence that they were complicit in the occupation
4989997 there is a long history of cooperation between israel and the uk and birax will help further cement this relationship and create new partnerships
4989998 there have been calls in the past for a boycott of israeli academics but i strongly believe that we have much to learn from each other and our researchers have much to gain from working together education should be a bridge between nations not a barrier
4989999 the new scheme increases academic collaboration in science and technology with potentially lasting benefits for britain israel and hopefully the world
