8630378 our goal is to pull back the curtain on the ugly truth
8630379 the leaders of the national rifle association who have long claimed to represent hunters and shooters have instead overwhelmingly supported the biggest conservation opponents in congress
8630380 unlike wayne lapierre chief executive officer of the nra i dont fly on private jets and my salary is a dollar a year i can also outshoot lapierre and ill gladly challenge him to a wild hunt thats a challenge i look forward to but i wont hold my breath that hell ever take it
8630381 while conservation groups across america came out against the sale of public land the nra stayed silent
8630382 i will not support a gun rights organization that works to elect members of congress who will allow our natural environment to be ruined by corporate polluters loggers strip miners and other groups that act to destroy americas great outdoors
8630383 no son comparables con los que present en el mismo periodo del a o anterior ya que en el primer semestre de 2007 atradius se consolidaba por el m todo de puesta en equivalencia y con un trimestre de decalaje y no as en el presente ejercicio en que se consolida por integraci n global y sin decalaje alguno

8630385 la comunidad de madrid con sus recursos es la que est atendiendo la totalidad de los servicios y sin embargo no recibe la financiaci n del estado respecto a este aumento eso debe estar reflejado en el nuevo modelo de financiaci n
8630386 incluidas las previsiones de actualizaci n referidas a la evoluci n de poblaci n
8630387 se han negado a aplicar el modelo de financiaci n vigente y sus instrumentos de revisi n y actualizaci n
8630388 han preferido por una decisi n pol tica y no de financiaci n un cambio de modelo fruto de una imposici n del gobierno tripartito de catalu a que le oblig aparte de a las modificaciones estatutarias a hacer un cambio en el sistema de financiaci n sin saber muy bien ad nde bamos hoy zapatero es preso de esa decisi n pol tica basada en sus intereses exclusivos de mantenerse en el poder con sus aliados nacionalistas
8630389 algo muy previsible y ahora al gobierno no le cuadra el sudoku como dijo el ministro de econom a pedro solbes
8630390 vemos desde hace varios d as en la prensa que diferentes presidentes de las autonom as gobernadas por el partido socialista est n en franca oposici n a los planteamientos del presidente de la generalitat catalana jos montilla y adem s cada uno haciendo reivindicaciones en raz n de sus propios intereses ayer zapatero reconoci que la situaci n se va a complicar va a ser lenta y que no est en condiciones de ofrecer una soluci n en el tema de financiaci n como en otras muchas otras cosas

8630421 a d a de hoy seguimos sin conocer que tiene que decir barreda sobre este asunto
8630422 algo tendr que decir barreda cuando esa decisi n puede suponer que no se inviertan 100 millones de euros y no se creen un n mero inicial de 500 puestos de trabajo en una comarca afectada por la crisis econ mica y el desempleo como puertollano cuando en diciembre del 2007 anunciaba junto al consejero de industria y sociedad de la informaci n jos manuel d az salazar la firma con bp solar del convenio para la implantaci n de la f brica
8630423 desde luego romper este tipo de convenios con el presidente del gobierno de castilla la mancha sin que tenga consecuencias nos puede llevar a pensar cu l es la validez que tienen los convenios y los acuerdos que firma barreda
8630424 vamos a seguir planteando acciones positivas para la regi n con ese trabajo que hemos venido haciendo en base de propuestas favorables para castilla la mancha
8630425 qu es lo que realmente est pasando en la comarca de puertollano

8630435 i dont know what happened really i didnt intend to do what i did i didnt know what i was doing it was just a blur
8630436 it is a tragedy that at 50 years of age he finds himself before a crown court judge facing an inevitable sentence of imprisonment
8630437 he is a decent hard working law abiding man who had a moment of madness if he could turn back the clock he surely would do
8630438 this is a single blow admittedly delivered by the butt end of a cue
8630439 he approached the oficer from the left side and punched him with a clenched fist to the left side of the face
8630440 this knocked the officer out and he fell to the ground hitting his head on the concrete
8630441 in these courts we so often see punches like this resulting in someones death and that could so easily have happened in this case
8630442 when i first read this case i was certain there would have to be an immediate sentence in a young offenders institution but then i read the letter from your aunt

8630482 during his 37 years with univest leon has played an important role in the banks growth
8630483 we have not only increased the number of financial service centers to 33 but univest now offers an array of banking insurance investment and wealth management solutions for businesses individuals and nonprofit organizations leon also has been instrumental in providing leadership for the companys customer experience initiative a focus on providing outstanding customer experiences at our offices which sets univest apart from other financial institutions
8630484 the most effective way for us to deliver our integrated platform of financial solutions and create outstanding customer experiences is by harmonizing our organizational structure with our day to day operations
8630485 as part of univests leadership team john william anthony and donald will serve as mentors for the organization to ensure success
8630486 the results show that operators are keen to enjoy the fruits of fmc as soon as possible that said they need to ensure they have the correct software platform in place to ensure as smooth a transition to fmc as possible problems arise when legacy non convergent software is being used in other parts of the operators oss it is apparent that oss vendors need to advise operators effectively on how best to move to a fully convergent oss
8630487 operators need to ensure their oss is ready for fmc comptels dynamic oss solutions enable telecom service providers to deliver services flexibly and charge for them effectively in a converged or legacy environment our software allows operators to launch new services with a fast time to market and we are already proving benefits to customers deploying fmc solutions such as taiwans fareastone
8630488 this is yet another example of our successful strategy to increase revenue and decrease our carrier costs
8630489 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8630490 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8630491 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8630492 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8630493 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8630494 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8630495 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8630496 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8630497 for years associations across europe have been contributing to their local communities in social causes such as fighting racism raising charity funds promoting integration and diversity and spreading the values of sport as well as helping former players who it
8630498 our foundation has helped many players who have fallen on hard times or needed operations at everton we have a great model and it would be fantastic for it to be the foundation for what happens across britain
8630499 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8630500 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8630501 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8630502 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8630503 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8630504 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8630505 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8630506 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8630507 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8630508 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8630509 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8630510 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8630511 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8630512 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8630513 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8630514 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8630515 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8630516 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8630517 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8630518 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8630519 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8630520 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8630521 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
8630522 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
8630523 if id known this would be the result of breaking the law i would never have done it
8630524 this is what some asshole said was religion and we as a religion follow whatever aforementioned asshole says is religion therefore this is part of our religion
8630525 does anyone ever expect british courts to overrule religious nutballs this must be a first
8630526 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8630527 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8630528 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8630529 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8630530 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8630531 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8630532 to make it look like an adirondack type of building
8630533 as a native of french village i am glad to see french village coming alive again
8630534 its great to see a local guy get this going
8630535 just as frank ushered in a golden era i hope this opening will mark the beginning of a resurgence in generation defining live music
8630536 in the end well be paying as much as someone who isnt a muni this is hard for everyone
8630537 i am counting on the federal government to act on behalf of new yorkers
8630538 anything less than a swift and comprehensive investigation as well as restitution would be unconscionable
8630539 but the physical properties of electricity dictate that it travel principally on the shortest path between the two points meaning it still traversed the congested lines in new york
8630540 its very clear that the colleges attitude was were not really supporting this for some reason
8630541 we gave him a discount for renting the field and provided as much assistance as possible and for him to imply that the colleges lack of assistance was responsible for him not having a successful program it seems he is coming up with an excuse for his own failed event
8630542 perhaps based on the attendance berkeley green would be a more suitable venue for his event
8630543 it takes time to build an event like this usually three or four years
8630544 people know about the event but in order to really get the kind of saturation you want it takes more money than is generated by the event itself
8630545 the way housing was handled was directly adversarial toward the people calling
8630546 this drains from your ability to make the partnership work
8630547 in hindsight i should have never done it because i knew it was going to be tough with the timing of school starting
8630548 this is considered one of the finest natural fields in upstate new york
8630549 these are damages not normal wear and tear and that is what he is responsible for any damage
8630550 the fact is they rented us the field as a gathering place for us to hold a concert
8630551 having so many people on the turf at one time is having the greatest impact on your grass
8630552 the two spots im looking at are close enough that if i was there and i wanted to get something to eat or somewhere to stay i would go to saranac lake
8630553 you know part of the reason we had it at nccc was so saranac lakers could walk and that wasnt happening as much as we had hoped anyway
8630554 its a great day and we have something great to celebrate
8630555 these people and groups have all worked diligently to bring this project from conception to a reality
8630556 its important that we show that remote does not mean inaccessible
8630557 my husband is a retired contractor and he couldnt find anything to criticize
8630558 i cant think of a better example of shared services
8630559 gateways and front doors are so important to our communities and to the economic successes we have had
8630560 we are really looking forward to having that same sort of welcome and that same sort of corridor extending through the park street business district
8630561 any time you do a job in the adirondacks it is important to take nature into account
8630562 theyve been great on this we all love the environment here its part of the beauty of this area
8630563 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8630564 he got into the files just yesterday so we wanted to have him on to find out what he found and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
8630565 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well to kind of balance it out
8630566 the obama national headquarters is just down the street from here they obviously have the time to send out these angry emails but they cant walk a few blocks to our studios
8630567 theres no race in the country that more starkly epitomizes the choice in this election in november than new hampshire

8630576 blocking my site is a move by a desperate government that is trying to silence me but its not going to stop me
8630577 it only reveals that the government does not know how to handle the internet

8630579 if it can happen to raja petra it can also happen to other bloggers
8630580 in a democracy we dont have to agree with each other but we must defend the right of everyone to speak up including raja petra and other voices of dissent
8630581 intend to curtail peoples freedom or right to express themselves

8630595 i like to throw my two cents in regardless if it has any real baring on the situation
8630596 im phallic im witty and clever and think that as long as i compliment the right people i will never get a negative 2 weeeeeeeeeee
8630597 he is still recovering from a metatarsal injury and has done bits of training
8630598 it is quite promising in terms of recovery from the injury but he is still well short of a competitive match
8630599 i can confirm that i am joining spurs right now i am getting my visa as soon as it is ready i will fly to london to sign a contract
8630600 id like to clarify that i did not make these particular remarks
8630601 i spoke about the difficulty i had settling in to life in manchester but that does not reflect how i feel now i enjoy my life very much as a footballer at manchester united and im very happy to be a part of this great club
8630602 i think i show that in the way i play every week
8630603 i also have far too much respect for the people of manchester and england to criticise them in this way
8630604 i will never stay to live in england thats for sure
8630605 you get only a brief glimpse of sunlight before its all cloudy again the winters are mild but in summer the temperatures seldom go higher than 20c and it rains rains rains
8630606 in the future i would like to test myself in another top league im thinking of spain
8630607 at least there will be no reason to complain about the weather in england they say that manchester is the city of rain its main attraction is considered to be the timetable at the railway station where trains leave for less rainy cities
8630608 its not only the weather that im not happy about here in russia and serbia the peoples way of life is similar in england its totally different
8630609 here they just dont have time to feel the joy of life
8630610 throughout the week they all work so hard they only talk to people at lunch break then in the evening they come home and watch the telly so they can get up early for work the next day
8630611 the only time to meet friends is at weekends but for football players its the busiest time of all
8630612 the players are determined it wont be another nine years before we win it again
8630613 if it is another nine years i will be 42 and i dont think that is going to happen do you
8630614 i know maldini did it when he was coming up to 40 but i am telling you there is no chance that will be me it has to be in the next couple of years if i am going to win it again
8630615 after missing out on 1999 i never comforted myself by believing wed win it again soon after and id be involved
8630616 i know how tough it is to get back there there are 15 20 very good teams capable of winning the european cup
8630617 i just said to myself if it happens it happens i just thought carry on playing and then one day we might be good enough to do it again thankfully we did it would have been a little disappointment to have gone through my career and not appeared in a champions league final
8630618 but it wouldnt have been a massive downer id have got over it i have been lucky enough to win a lot of trophies so if i hadnt got a champions league winners medal i would have just said so be it
8630619 i enjoyed it in moscow though we won the trophy everybody wants to win it was a great night
8630620 i have no idea why we didnt push on from 1999 and win a few more
8630621 we dont want it to be nine years before we win it again we want it again soon we won it last year with a young team and they will be a year further on and definitely better it will be something to look forward to
8630622 for one reason or another we just werent good enough after 99 i dont think there was any taking the foot off the pedal after barcelona
8630623 the lads still wanted to win it again we knew how much of a good time we had when winning it but for one reason or another it just didnt happen whether people got complacent i am not too sure
8630624 i hope this year we do better after winning it but the fact nobody has ever retained it tells you everything there are so many top teams around europe who want to win it and they buy players each year on the strength of wanting to win it we are no different
8630625 my hunger and desire has never diminished you win something and it is great for a day or two and then it is over it has to be that way
8630626 you enjoy it on the night and celebrate and then a day or two after it is about the next trophy and the next season

8630648 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8630649 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8630650 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8630651 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8630652 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8630653 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8630710 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8630711 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8630712 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8630713 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8630714 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8630715 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

8630720 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8630721 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8630722 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8630723 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8630724 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8630725 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8630726 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8630727 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8630774 thats what social workers said to me when i came into post you have to change this
8630775 it is a fact that at the moment we are not completely fulfilling our statutory responsibility
8630776 its not fair for the 178 children who are in care not to have an allocated social worker it is a piece of nonsense
8630777 there is broad consensus that the current arrangements in relation to childrens social work services need to change
8630778 referrals are increasing markedly there is difficulty meeting some statutory responsibilities and insufficient focus on preventative services for children and families
8630779 there is need for a radical review of how resources are used and how the service is organised
8630780 its imperative that every child in our care does have a social worker and it is a grave concern to me that they dont im not entirely convinced that this reorganisation is going to help that
8630781 we should be asking for more money instead of stretching the budget as far as it can go

8630815 international assignments are something you naturally want to prolong repeat due to the ability to enjoy a lifestyle beyond your normal means at home and the enjoyment of living and working in different environments
8630816 i am sure that one year in my job is the equivalent of ten years in a similar job back home but if i am honest it is that very same stimulation that keeps me here
8630817 i think what makes expat assignments addictive is the empowerment one gets from facing so many challenges and being successful including overcoming the failed moments and crises you come out stronger and you emerge bolder i believe what that does is make you feel a little bit invincible and prepared to take even more risks you want to put all that into practice and do it again
8630818 expat living certainly is addictive i came to barcelona 20 years ago and was quickly seduced by the climate food and drink and the lifestyle speaking catalan so well now makes me something of a celebrity this means that its easy to make friends and i have a much more positive view of myself than i did when i was back home
8630819 i love being an expat because of the fascinating people i meet and the friendships that form
8630820 one thing that i know i will really miss is the wide variety of interesting people that we get to meet perhaps the hardest thing about going home again after living abroad is that quite frankly nobody really cares about all your adventures
8630821 there are two key reasons why expatriates have difficulty repatriating one we want to use what we have learned overseas when we return home unfortunately my experience as a practitioner involved in global mobility is that the majority of returnees are not assigned to jobs that recognise or utilise their international experience effectively two because we have been changed by our international experience we can never return home and pick up where we left off

8630913 i had the opportunity to meet mayor daley i was sitting just a couple of seats away from him
8630914 to the delegates he was a hero but not to the media
8630915 you couldnt walk down the sidewalk without being accosted by someone
8630916 he was trying hard to maintain order in the city but the newsmen constantly had a microphone in his face
8630917 i remember some people put up posters the next night reading mayor daley for president and some of the mayors supporters were marching with the posters outside the convention headquarters
8630918 was tremendous armed guards metal detectors searches guards with machine guns armed guards on the roof
8630919 now people expect the need for security but in those days it seemed excessive
8630920 we came across a long line of chicago cops and a long line of hippies facing off the hippies were taunting the cops and calling them names like pigs which was a popular term back then
8630921 the cops were standing in a line tapping their nightsticks on their
8630922 all of a sudden the chicago police commander said go and the cops started swinging those billy clubs smacking hippies like mosquitoes tim and i freaked out and ran all the way back to the suburbs we were fine after an underwear change
8630923 people today forget the intensity of the opposition to the war
8630924 i was only three years out of the army myself i saw those young people with rifles and wondered if it would happen here
8630925 the vietnamese studies center on campus was the main catalyst
8630926 i also worked undercover marching in protests right in the middle of everything
8630927 the first month after i was hired my paycheck was doubled because of all the overtime i worked we used to stay all night in the design building barracks too
8630928 one night i was at the moose club with my brother and met jack hazel the carbondale police chief
8630929 we had 13 police officers shot in carbondale in two years between 1968 and 1970
8630930 and there were only about 50 men on the force nobody was killed
8630931 because the pay was good and i wouldnt be getting shot at all the time like i was in vietnam
8630932 when i came on the attitude toward the police was very respectful but that changed the people changed the vietnam war changed everything
8630933 they were subvert ing the entire decade and the future of the country was at stake and our city the coun try was really going to hell it was becoming a place that we no longer recognized
8630934 they were a rotten generation and they made each day we went to work harder and our communities less safe they joined with the black militants and that was nothing but trouble let me tell you
8630935 we were not the ones breaking windows and throwing bottles and tying up traffic and making it so that an honest man could not make a living
8630936 wanted to see a situation where we were going to beat the hell out of the demonstrators
8630937 we wanted exactly what happened we wanted the tear gas to get so heavy that the reality was tear gas we were guilty as hell
8630938 it is not really their fault they were obeying the orders of mayor daley because when we went to jail they didnt beat us in jail they didnt act like irrational monsters in jail
8630939 yeah they got their bonnets beaten a little but if you want to play the game ya gotta play the game we had been getting bad press long before the convention especially for what was going on in the black neighborhoods so what the hell
8630940 they were trying to make us look as bad as possible
8630941 all of the violence of the sixties put together doesnt add up to a weekend in beirut
8630942 exonerate the actions of the police than to explain them within a historical context and remove much of the hyperbole and mischaracterizations
8630943 i like to read about people who have done nothing spectacular who arent beautiful or lucky who try to behave well in the limited field of activity they command but who can see in little autumnal moments of vision that the so called big experiences of life are going to miss them and i like to read about such things presented not with self pity or despair or romanticism but with realistic firmness amp even humour that is in fact what the critics wd call the moral tone of the book
8630944 i read everything except philosophy theology economics sociology science or anything to do with the wonders of nature anything to do with technology have i said politics im trying think of all the dewey decimal classes in point of fact i virtually read only novels or something pretty undemanding in the non fiction line which might be a biography i read almost no poetry

8630972 challenged the definition that existed during their time of what it meant to be a man

8630986 it looks back at the civil rights movement the american indian movement we have to look back really at late 50s and early 60s with the free speech movement and civil rights movement that kind of revolutionary thought continues throughout the vietnam war
8630987 the kinds of revolutionary ideas certainly preceded 1968 it didnt just all of the sudden fall out of the sky but somehow we look at 68 because it in some way captures the zeitgeist and politics of the time
8630988 we fixate on 1968 because it was a point globally when people took to the streets in france czechoslovakia and clearly with the convention here
8630989 technology and cultural upheaval came together and began to change things
8630990 people who didnt normally have access to the media suddenly had it with portable video that started to shift who controlled the media what stories were told how they were told and how people can see them
8630991 i got through this with a lot of support from family friends and the extended family i have been blessed with having from the grateful dead community the support was really mind boggling
8630992 i was shocked and scared for sure but i kind of just adopted a whatever it takes kind of attitude

8630995 it has been quite a journey for me to come back to my roots musically and creatively with ratdog
8630996 really get back to where i started creative stretching rock and roll playing where all bets are off it is always a trip though because you dont know where a song is going to go sometimes you think youll have a small little tune and it will stretch out to 20 minutes long
8630997 i didnt really have a sense of what to expect from myself
8630998 i was off for almost a year as it worked out though its a lot like riding a bike i was doing it for nearly 10 years and when i got back on that stage at that first show back my recollection was that it was a really fun show
8630999 theyre a great band that flies too far below the radar
8631000 were all so busy we dont get to play our tour as much as wed like to but its a really great band
8631001 i get to be the main writer and lead singer and i really love to do those things
8631002 we have been trying to get a record done for quite a while now ive done a lot of work in the studio through the years helping other folks realize their musical vision and i just want to complete something of my own none of us know how long we get to be here and cancer gave me a new outlook
8631003 i love it the fact is that i am incredibly blessed to be in a community like this i am blessed that this is what i get to do and i have incredible musical freedom every night
8631004 if we are doing our job we get the fans fired up and then they fire us up
8631005 deep despair i drew myself the representative of an individual in despair with hands palm outstretched outwards and downwards in the manner of goyas peasant before the firing squad i formalised the drawing into a line and put a circle round it
8631006 going with my parents and seeing the cnd sign held up on broomsticks
8631007 a lot of people dont necessarily know the sign came out of the nuclear disarmament movement but it still has meaning to people it still carries a positive message of peace its become almost akin to a smiley face
8631008 sure its probably not what the hippies had in mind for it to become a marketing campaign for a department store but its a symbol of the mainstreaming of counter cultural ideas of things that were part of the alternative lifestyle like environmentalism and organic food isnt that ultimately what the hippies would have wanted
8631009 holtom is probably spinning in his grave now the original anti bomb marchers came from a very anti fashion perspective
8631010 these decades offer answers to present problems think of the 70s eco movement an alternative way of living theres a really strong connection between then and now
8631011 everyone can have a piece of this look as its so simple its a fashion shorthand and its incredibly accessible
8631012 we need to restore the hope and idealism weve lost over the last eight years
8631013 this is the worst administration in the history of the united states
8631014 for all the complex struggles and the internal confusions it is an organization of enormous symbolic and real importance for american farmworkers
8631015 the day of nonviolence is over it is gone with the wind
8631016 it is a large property and there is a lot of debris inside which will have to be painstakingly sifted through and examined
8631017 once we have access to the house we will find out whether the family was inside at the time of the fire
8631018 see dude this is why your daughter doesnt talk to you its not my fault she likes me better

8631054 het is erg belangrijk om te weten wat je talenten en capaciteiten zijn als je gaat solliciteren
8631055 het geeft je richting in sollicitatiegesprekken en het helpt je om alleen op functies te solliciteren die aansluiten bij wat jij goed kan weten wat dat is is dus cruciaal
8631056 dat kan op allerlei manieren het belangrijkste is echter om er daadwerkelijk mee aan de slag te gaan veel mensen doen dat niet of niet serieus genoeg je maakt dus al snel het verschil als je echt gaat onderzoeken waarin je goed bent hoe bijvoorbeeld via zelfonderzoek gecombineerd met oefeningen om jezelf te leren kennen zulke oefeningen vind je in boeken op websites of op loopbaansites
8631057 ik vind het zelf altijd leuk om mensen te laten nadenken over momenten in hun leven waarin ze helemaal tot hun recht kwamen en helemaal opgingen in hun talent op zulke momenten zit je in een flow wanneer was dat en van welke talenten maakte je toen gebruik
8631058 bedenk wat jij te bieden hebt wat je goed kan en leuk vindt en ga vervolgens in gesprek of op onderzoek uit om te weten te komen of je die dingen kwijt kunt in de functie
8631059 aan jou dus de taak om te zorgen dat jij die persoon bent
8631060 dat kan alleen maar als die functie of dat bedrijf jou ook echt raakt

8631087 so one woman comes over to my desk and comments on how
8631088 als gevolg van droogte en hoge voedselprijzen zien we bijna een verdubbeling van de mensen die gevoed moeten worden dat is een toename van 7 miljoen mensen alleen al dit jaar
8631089 in 2006 was de prijs van kunstmest verdubbeld evenals het jaar daarvoor hierdoor konden we niet de hoeveelheid kunstmest kopen die we nodig hebben hierdoor viel de oogst veel lager uit te laag om mijn gezin te voeden na een paar maanden was de voedselvoorraad er door heen we zochten werk op grotere boerderijen als loonarbeider maar door de hoge kunstmestprijzen viel de productie op deze boerderijen ook tegen dus minder werk voor loonarbeiders hierdoor viel het salaris tegen daarnaast hadden we droogte in februari en maart kunnen we meestal traditionele noodgewassen oogsten vooral wilde aardappelen maar deze waren door uitblijvende regens verdroogd ernstig gebrek aan voedsel was het gevolg veel mensen raakten ondervoed en ziek vooral kinderen veel van hen zijn naar opvangcentra gegaan voor medische verzorging en voedsel
8631090 de oogst komt binnen en is erg mager ze voorzien dat ze het niet zullen halen tot de volgende oogst binnen is het eerste dat ze doen is een os verkopen door de hoge voedselprijzen kunnen ze met de opbrengst slechts enkele maanden vooruit maar aan het begin van de regentijd hebben ze geen os meer om hun land te ploegen zo stapelen de problemen zich op door voedseltekort raken ze verzwakt hun kinderen ondervoed en hebben ze niet meer de middelen om voldoende land te bewerken voor de volgende oogst
8631091 we hadden een speciale oproep voor geld eerder dit jaar donoren reageerden genereus waarschijnlijk omdat ze de invloed van stijgende voedsel en brandstof prijzen onderkenden dit was alleen om de extra kosten te dekken
8631092 massimo oddo o tipo de jogador que pode fazer todo o corredor direito para n s a sua experi ncia e capacidades t cnicas e t cticas representam um acrescento de qualidade

8631096 as an african american and a lesbian i havent been through one day without facing some sort of discrimination but this is just shocking
8631097 we believe that the actions of the contract security guard were inappropriate and unacceptable we have notified his company paragon of our position in the matter
8631098 il pleut sur la ville comme il pleut dans mon coeur
8631099 the typical adult would earn an extra 8 000 a year on average if he or she was paid for the housework and other chores done week in week out for free

8631111 i wouldnt make any plans for the next couple of months
8631112 really spoke to me as a woman and i think she spoke to a lot of people in that way
8631113 its an incredible time to be around i wish my momma could have seen this day
8631114 with obama we make history if you ready for obama make some noise yo man lets do this for obama
8631115 every single advance for gay rights has come at the state level
8631116 go back and support those pro gay state legislators and eliminate the anti gay state legislators
8631117 just a little bit of money goes a long way
8631118 the only way bigots are going to learn is if we take their power away from them
8631119 people kept asking what kind of music theyd hear on this next album
8631120 whether it was going to be r amp b pop country or rock and i seemed to keep saying the same thing its going to be a little bit of everything i guess
8631121 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance
8631122 most cover letters begin with something like in response to your job advertisement im forwarding my resume for your review and consideration
8631123 make a stronger first impression by writing something different something that will readily show the value you offer
8631124 what core competencies would enable you to excel in the position youre targeting
8631125 what this shows is that you can go directly from one type of adult cell to another without going back to the beginning
8631126 you could say for example its like turning a scientist into a lawyer without sending her all the way back to kindergarten
8631127 meltons work is going to inspire an explosion of experiments in directing the fate of tissues in one way or another in ways that may be more practical than having to reprogram them back to pluripotency
8631128 hey man im serious it may seam degrading but i dont figure it that way no matter what you do in life someone is going to jack off to you anyway
8631129 we were just two college guys going to school and having fun
8631130 weve now been advised by the bureaucrats at the democratic national committee that our form is not acceptable that we need to use their forms so we need to redo what we did
8631131 its weird to like fake sex and put your parts up against someone elses
8631132 i know that if i ever smoked pot i would probably become like a total pothead because i think i would like that
8631133 i have like a chill personality so thats why im never going to start because i dont like to be dependent on anything i dont even drink coffee
8631134 i would have a very different career right now and im happy where im at
8631135 i was like all right man im ready i was eager that was great because i just sort of was fuelled you know
8631136 she came up to my dressing room and she was crying and she was like im so proud of you
8631137 i dont get showtime so i dont have any great reference for him and so when he came in to see us last november we couldnt believe that there was this guy who was so charismatic and such a good actor and then when he opened his mouth and sang for us all the little hairs on our arms stood up
8631138 i feel like we just had a very fortuitous moment just the right person the right time the right part
8631139 he has a very empathetic spirit and it allows him to climb into the character from the inside out and in a kind of complete and authentic way hes so big hearted as a person that he can stand at the centre of the story and the audience wants to climb in with him and thats such a gift
8631140 but they definitely put you in a box and my parents were very lenient and very open minded and let me explore for myself what i felt was right and wrong and they raised all their kids that way and none of us have problems with alcohol or drugs
8631141 silas is totally opposite of me and also not as smart as melchior
8631142 so silas is like the stupid version of not being me and melchior is like the smart intellectual version of not being me but i like doing that i like being able to play roles that are totally different from me
8631143 i like people and i like characters and i like jumping out of myself
8631144 dat je af gaat als je de levels voor het eerst ziet is niet zo vreemd maar zodra je weet hoe elk level werkt is het allemaal vrij simpel om uit te spelen dan want bij die highscores kom ik niet eens in de buurt met mn 650 punten

8631157 aaah non ti preoccupare io non ho nessuna intenzione di baciarti ne tantomeno di andare a letto con te questo poco ma sicuro
8631158 i appreciate chief justice minton for bringing together all of the parties who use court records to figure out a plan for retaining necessary records and destroying those that have little or no value
8631159 this is an exercise in cooperation between the executive and judicial branches in carrying out a mandate given by the legislative branch in 1977 the legislature gave the chief justice of kentucky statutory authority to determine how court records are to be maintained for 30 years the public has trusted the supreme court to carry out this responsibility we are now asking agencies that use these records to work with the judicial branch to decide what to destroy and what to keep
8631160 our first priority is to ensure community safety by keeping the records prosecutors need to effectively prosecute individuals who have committed crimes against the commonwealth secondly people are allowed to seek expungement of their criminal records under certain circumstances and we want the records to be available for them to do that and finally we have a fiscal responsibility that requires us to appropriately spend limited state funds

8631199 unsere erfolgsgeschichte am flughafen karlsruhe baden baden geht weiter f r das jahr 2008 erwarten wir insgesamt 600 000 passagiere und konnten somit die passagierzahl seit dem erstflug im september 2003 stetig steigern und wir sind sicher diesen trend auch im kommenden jahr fortsetzen zu k nnen denn die niedrigsten ticketpreise garantieren nach wie vor nur wir das aktuelle angebot erm glicht allen ryanair kunden in europa f r einen einzigen euro zu fliegen streckennetzweit und im gesamten reisezeitraum september und oktober 2008 wir raten daher allen kunden diese ein euro tickets direkt auf www ryanair de zu buchen und dabei die so genannten screenscraping webseiten zu meiden denn diese berechnen versteckte vermittlungsgeb hren die in einigen f llen schon bis zum dreifachen des eigentlichen ryanair tiefpreises ausmachten im bevorstehenden winter wird ryanair die ra des preiswert fliegens durch die ra des tiefpreis fliegens ersetzen und die heute frei geschalteten eine million ein euro tickets sind daher nur unsere aktuellste attacke auf die teuren mitbewerber und wir garantieren dass niemand diese preise unterbieten wird

8631230 the primary ground of gracious affections is the transcendently excellent and amiable nature of divine things as they are in themselves and not any conceived relation they bear to self or self interest
8631231 the supremely excellent nature of divine things is the first or primary and original objective foundation of the spiritual affections of true saints
8631232 the first foundation of a true love to god is that whereby he is in himself lovely or worthy to be loved or the supreme loveliness of his nature
8631233 if mens affection to god is founded first on his profitableness to them their affection begins at the wrong end they regard god only for the utmost limit of the stream of divine good where it touches them and reaches their interest and have no respect to that infinite glory of gods nature which is the original good and the true foundation of all good the first foundation of all loveliness of every kind and so the first foundation of all true love

8631237 true saints have their minds in the first place inexpressibly pleased and delighted with the sweet ideas of the glorious and amiable nature of the things of god
8631238 a true saint when in the enjoyment of true discoveries of the sweet glory of god and christ has his mind too much captivated and engaged by what he views without himself to stand at that time to view himself and his own attainments it would be a diversion and loss which he could not bear to take his eye off from the ravishing object of his contemplation to survey his own experience and to spend time in thinking with himself what a high attainment this is and what a good story i now have to tell others

8631287 ethanol is going to be costing you in the supermarket
8631288 because where people used to have wheat and rice growing in the field theyve all switched to corn now people are producing corn and turning it into ethanol the cost of cheese has gone up the cost of bread has gone up the cost of crackers has gone up everything has gone up
8631289 declared his intention to apply this formula on a world scale which means none other than the internationalisation of genocide
8631290 it is not often that this newspaper finds itself in agreement with fidel castro
8631291 the price of corn has a relatively low impact on the overall price of food because theres not that many products when you sit down and think about it that are impacted by the price of corn
8631292 however every product that you buy practically is impacted by the price of oil say you buy a twinkie that twinkie will have traveled 1 500 miles before you buy it you think about that at 4 25 per gallon for diesel fuel and thats a pretty significant number
8631293 when someone talks about the food supply or the diversion of crops they are not being 100 percent honest about factoring in the feed co product that comes from the process
8631294 thats one study there are probably 100 others that find the opposite
8631295 the department of agriculture has one for example what they say is when you factor in the entire process including the production of distillers grains thats that feed co product you get 67 percent more energy than it took to produce and the industry is getting more efficient
8631296 to produce ethanol with as much energy as we use in transportation would require 1 1 billion acres devoted to high yield corn production complete with all the things environmentalists hate fertilizer irrigation and pesticides thats about 1 8 million square miles some 51 percent of the land area of the 50 states
8631297 nobodys talking about that no one is saying ethanol is going to be the gallon for gallon replacement for oil
8631298 but its part of the solution and the land use issue they use some really wide generalities when they look at that issue

8631303 in its simplest form pins is a system that notifies police forces about upcoming prisoner releases
8631304 it compares the prison population against those about to be released in a certain area a lot of crime is repeat crime often committed by the same offenders the idea is to reduce this crime by allowing the police to prepare for prisoner releases
8631305 as well as that because officers have the information at their fingertips they can examine the existing prisoner population and see which prisoners are associating with whom members of different gangs associating with one another in prison fuels the increase in regional crime levels
8631306 a prisoner could be in prison and a warrant could be issued on the outside and pins helps officers keep a tab on that it sounds ridiculous but some criminals actually go to prison just to hide now someone with a criminal career wont be able to hide in this way
8631307 historically because of irelands size it hasnt been a big issue for the garda but with the rise of organised crime knowledge of prisoners matters more and more
8631308 in the uk the various police forces are looking at integrating pins into the new police national computer from a technology point of view another important development is the ability to make pins securely available on mobile handsets via tetra over the airwave network so police officers will be made aware of prisoner releases in a way not too dissimilar to receiving an email via a blackberry
8631309 some people with dangerous backgrounds are often released into an area where the police arent aware of their backgrounds
8631310 the technology allows police to more effectively manage offenders especially those convicted of violent crimes and ensure public safety
8631311 we take rural development seriously and this is the reason we have joined with the community of sherwood content in this effort usain is an inspiration to all jamaicans young and old and we felt that his achievements should be celebrated and heralded as a standard that we must all seek to attain
8631312 the nation is caught up in the pride and confidence that bolt has instilled in us since his emergence as our ambassador on the world stage while he belongs to all jamaicans he is first and foremost a son of the community of sherwood content during the olympics national meats provided a big screen tv to the community so that we could all watch usain make us 1proud and together shared in the joy of his victories we also sponsored a motorcade and a celebration party after usain won the 200m
8631313 i cannot express the honour we feel to have been asked by national meats to produce the hart hill usain bolt homecoming celebration to be a part of an olympic celebration honouring one of the greatest athletes we may ever see is beyond words

8631322 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8631323 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8631324 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8631325 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8631426 stansted is part of the vital mix that makes the east of england a competitive location for business
8631427 its growth underpins our own economy stansteds success breeds our regions success the 2 000 plus overseas owned businesses located here not only gain access to the uks most innovative region but also to major trade centres throughout europe
8631428 stansted boasts more european destinations than any other airport in the world which ensures that businesses here are truly european operations
8631429 a quick comparison between comparable office premises shows that those near stansted are at least 25 per cent less expensive than a location near heathrow staff cost is also lower

8631432 foreign direct investment is crucial to the continuing growth of the regional economy
8631433 for european companies setting up in the uk locating within easy access to stansted is a natural decision some make it a requirement

8631440 i had been looking for a location for a lodge and spa where the owners were completely involved in the project i didnt want a bourgeois ch teau or just a vineyard and i thought the site was near enough perfect
8631441 the idea was to adapt the kind of all inclusive safari lodges i had seen in south africa to southern france where it wouldnt look like an african pastiche but integrate entirely in the environment
8631442 we want owners to feel like members of the lodge spa vineyard and restaurant in a hassle free way rather than buy as pure investment so weve tried to make personal use much more flexible than usual leaseback arrangements
8631443 the french might like the idea but i am not so sure that british lovers of france will be tempted it is the traditional rural lifestyle they seek
8631444 leaseback schemes have also lost favour the current market is playing safe and safe investment for uk buyers of french property remains stone country cottages

8631496 and i think this will be her year to put all aspects of her game together and really have some success
8631497 i really do think we can compete with the best of them
8631498 one of the characteristics of demarest is to want to be in the mix and be one of the last ones standing hopefully thats where well be again this year competing for the top spot
8631499 here in america and especially here tonight we need to remember two basic truths
8631500 society has an obligation and christians have a gospel duty to provide adequate and compassionate support for unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
8631501 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family
8631502 that teach american history not as it actually happened but as the professor thinks it should have happened
8631503 classes in pop culture drugs sex and the entertainment industry
8631504 college is supposed to be about challenging our understanding not picking and choosing what one wants to hear and ridiculing the reality of other peoples lives
8631505 because we will dedicate next wednesday to the extraordinary event that occurred on the road to damascus pauls conversion an essential change in his life that followed from his meeting with christ today we will pause briefly on the whole of his life
8631506 in fact the celebration of the pauline year we are observing follows this chronology the year 2008 was chosen thinking of his birth more or less in the year 8
8631507 in any case paul was born in tarsus in cilicia a jew of the diaspora he spoke greek although having a name of latin origin derived by assonance from the hebrew original saul saulos and he held roman citizenship
8631508 paul seems to be situated therefore on the border of the various cultures roman greek hebrew and perhaps also because of this was disposed to fruitful universal openness to a mediation between cultures to a true universality
8631509 to be understood probably as a laborer of coarse goats wool or linen fibers to make mats or tents
8631510 left tarsus and went to jerusalem to be educated at the feet of rabbi gamaliel the elder nephew of the great rabbi hillel according to the most rigid norms of pharisaism acquiring a great zeal for the mosaic torah
8631511 paul passed into history more as a christian what is more as an apostle than as a pharisee his apostolic activity is subdivided traditionally on the basis of three missionary journeys to which is added a fourth his journey to rome as a prisoner all are narrated by luke in the acts
8631512 in troas another important event took place in a dream paul saw a macedonian from the other side of the sea namely in europe who said come and help us
8631513 it was the future europe that requested the help and light of the gospel
8631514 in this brief account of pauls journeys suffice it to take into account how he dedicated himself to the proclamation of the gospel without sparing his energy and facing a series of grave trials of which he has left us an account in the second letter to the corinthians
8631515 we see a determination that is explained only by a soul truly fascinated by the light of the gospel enamored of christ a soul sustained by a profound conviction that it is necessary to take the light of christ to the world to proclaim the gospel to all
8631516 this i think is what stays with us from this brief account of st pauls journeys to see his passion for the gospel and thus intuit the grandeur the beauty and even more the deep need that all of us have of the gospel
8631517 let us pray so that the lord who made paul see his light and hear his word and touched his heart profoundly make us also see his light so that our hearts will also be touched by his word and so that we too will be able to give todays world which thirsts for it the light of the gospel and the truth of christ

8631532 of course i might be thinking of cats hard to tell the difference truth to tell youre all sort of well fuzzy arent you
8631533 so what was i saying oh yes what do the plants want or more precisely what do they need sunlight and water yes i shouldnt expect they desire much more than that its not as if we could carry them out for a night on the town nor would they appreciate it i imagine what do you think
8631534 i suppose i could try not watering them of course by the looks of their roots they would probably just break into the plumbing under the house and then where would we be i simply cannot do without my evening bath
8631535 or i could try to cut off their supply of sunlight no no perhaps not i have many connections in high places but sol is not on my list of flunkies im afraid if i only knew about thirty pilots who could fly a large tarp over the grounds

8631557 maar ze zullen wegblijven waar microsoft exchange sterk staat in het datacenter bij grote bedrijven wel gaat het aanslaan bij kleine bedrijven die nu ook al e mail gebruiken van een derde partij maar de cloud heeft voorlopig nog veel problemen met betrouwbaarheid beveiliging en privacy

8631573 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8631574 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers

8631611 we believe it should be clearly understood that that in the case of stv at least itv derives significant benefits from our custom and direct financial support
8631612 we make a substantial contribution to the itv network programme costs which they in turn can exploit on their other channels and online and as our national advertising sales agent

8631638 also none of the movies releasing friday are family oriented and neither the music of any of these movies has garnered a good response

8631855 the territory previously known in soviet times as south ossetia is completely cleansed of remnants of the georgian population
8631856 one of the best parts was seeing the excited expressions when they first saw the oil coming out of the press
8631857 we wanted to find a way to push the production of coconut oil down to the bottom of the economic pyramid into the homes of rural families
8631858 the byu students accomplished exactly what we had hoped they would a low cost robust system to produce virgin coconut oil in a rural african setting
8631859 the objective of the trip was actually to test the people and see their reactions while using the press
8631860 some of the villagers dont even read numbers so written instructions were of no help we had to show them how to use it but after only a few practices they knew exactly what they were doing
8631861 we thought about designing a smaller oven and even considered just leaving it behind
8631862 we put our engineering heads together and came up with a plan to partially dismantle the oven to reduce it to the appropriate size
8631863 if you give them a part that they cant buy in africa and it breaks they cant fix their tools
8631864 we successfully got everything we needed to africa without losing anything that was really a miracle
8631865 the people there were so helpful and excited in assisting with the project
8631866 both the villagers and the students worked really hard together
8631867 they came up with a lot of models and ideas and then they did a ton of testing
8631868 after all the testing they did seeing everyones face when we got the first batch of oil out of the press in africa was like the sum of everything coming together all at once
8631869 i knew this project would allow us to be a part of a tremendous change in the lives of the people that we aimed to help
8631870 i saw the gratitude in the eyes of the people as they realized the opportunities this project opened to drastically improve their lives

8631875 two thirds of adverse events after a heart attack which may be a further heart attack stroke or major bleed happen after a patient has been discharged from hospital
8631876 our findings are of concern because we believe that the risk for patients whose heart attack was originally considered not as severe may be being misjudged
8631877 this does not mean to say that all patients who have had a heart attack will need surgical intervention but that doctors should carry out a simple recommended risk assessment that unfortunately is not being routinely used but which takes in a variety of factors to help work out the best treatment
8631878 we plan to evaluate a group of women with lam who are experiencing shortness of breath for the presence of pulmonary hypertension
8631879 we will look at participants medical history pulmonary function tests exercise tolerance echocardiogram results and previous biopsy samples
8631880 we are hopeful this information will increase our understanding of how lam can manifest in the patients it affects in the future this information may be useful in developing better management strategies for this disease
8631881 some participants will be seen once in clinic and undergo testing with an echocardiogram while participating in this study
8631882 the individuals who have already undergone a clinical pulmonary hypertension evaluation may be able to participate through a review of select medical records and lung biopsy specimens

8631889 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8631890 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8631891 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions to the contrast agent
8631892 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
8631893 these tiny transducers work together to create one large transducer working much like the compound eyes of insects
8631894 i believe we have shown that 3 d ultrasound clearly works in a wide variety of interventional procedures
8631895 we envision a time in the not too distant future when this technology becomes standard equipment in various catheter kits
8631896 we created a solution that not only gathers dna but preserves it and kills mold and bacteria which has never been done before
8631897 we think the use of this technology does make maximum use of available science relative to identification and collection which heretofore may have caused law enforcement and those who investigate and prosecute cases to not have the evidence that they need

8631905 fixing the criminal justice system is obviously an important goal for any society yet we realise that it alone will not make us a safe society and that unless we significantly reduce the demand on the criminal justice system it will never be able to deliver justice for all

8632125 i think they will have a great response from the coastal living reader
8632126 the reader has the discretionary income to buy the product and this is in line with what she wants
8632127 in the development of this product the words coastal living were never used with the retailer or the sales rep we wanted the product to stand on its own
8632128 my travels tell me that the retailer is looking for something new different and fresh

8632139 unlicensed spectrum is great for short range coverage like wifi in a house but if you want to cover all of washington you need licensed spectrum in order to make sure a transmitter is protected from interference
8632140 its certainly something worth exploring rather than introducing potentially millions of tv viewers to unlicensed interference
8632141 the pro of licensing is that it would bring money to the treasury
8632142 the con is that it potentially stifles the creativity that may occur more freely in an unlicensed environment

8632179 the consoles themselves are in one sense simply very good drm technologies that consumers welcome and pay for in order to receive the benefits that come with them such as the healthy variety of games which are able to prosper in such a protected environment and the greater ease of installation use and reliability
8632180 but judging by for example the number of users who downloaded our patches there were a lot more active players than there were unit sales and i think we can safely say if they were still playing the game by the time our latest patch released and if they were playing on a pirated copy then they were a sale that didnt happen but probably would have had it not been possible to obtain the game illegally
8632181 there are many approaches to dealing with piracy and not all of them require attempting to overcome it directly with more restrictive drm

8632187 looking back on it evacuating people from one hurricane zone into another hurricane zone doesnt make a lot of sense
8632188 that was a strange circumstance because it wasnt an evacuation in advance of a hurricane it was an evacuation after the floods it was a humanitarian effort
8632189 its pure common sense if youre trying to run from storms you dont go right back into where another storm may hit instead you go inland to avoid the water and the hurricanes

8632227 we have commissioned kpmg to do a report on the equestrian shooting and basketball venues looking at whether the olympic experience and the legacy they will provide represents value for money
8632228 when you take the costs for these venues it seems like a lot of money to a lot of people it is a sort of testing to destruction to see whether that spending can be justified
8632229 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition

8632239 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting

8632245 they are spending their last months making it more difficult to put needed protections for workers in place in the future
8632246 but when you have a well recognized hazard like coal mine dust
8632247 the only thing it gets you is additional years of rulemaking and that translates into delayed protection
8632248 to slip through a rule that may have a profound negative impact on the health and safety of american workers

8632257 art and power demonstrates how certain works traditionally perceived by western scholars as religious in nature also embody references to the political sphere and vice versa
8632258 this exhibition attempts to introduce a sense of history and time into the discussion of african art by linking developments in artistic styles with corresponding changes in luba songye chokwe and luluwa political organizations and structures
8632259 by offering a new perspective on works of astonishing variety this exhibition represents the cleveland museum of arts commitment to scholarship
8632260 art and power provides museum visitors across the country the opportunity to view complex examples of african art at a time when our own collection of african art is not on public view
8632261 one of the most important international exhibitions ever mounted on the trypilian culture ancient ukraine will be of great interest to all visitors especially those fascinated by ancient societies
8632262 we are delighted to work closely with first lady mrs yushchenko these european institutions as well as canadas ukrainian canadian community to present the achievements of this highly sophisticated neolithic culture
8632263 in the century since their discovery archaeologists have learned that the trypilians were even more extraordinary than khvoika imagined
8632264 it is uncertain why this culture disappeared trypilians may have been replaced by indo european peoples who expanded both east and west at this period or perhaps as the climate became drier and the forest steppe gave way to steppe the cultures ecological equilibrium was stressed and a way of life was adopted to mirror their more technologically advanced neighbours

8632270 very disappointing that a fellow prosecutor would say things where he has no knowledge none zero on what were doing
8632271 no 1 there is no independent prosecutor law in pennsylvania anymore thats expired so we couldnt do that
8632272 no 2 in order to get an independent prosecutor law youd have to get the legislature to pass such a thing what do you think the likelihood of that is right now he hasnt given thought to that
8632273 no 3 the cost to go out and hire somebody else to do it would be fantastic because wed have to hire other investigators were already paying for my investigators
8632274 whats most troubling is that if he were out on the streets someone would recognize him
8632275 there is a person who reported seeing someone who matched his description on august 13th
8632276 but they couldnt identify his face only his body type
8632277 unfortunately this isnt as uncommon as one might think people disappear
8632278 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8632279 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8632280 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8632281 if the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms insists upon a firefight give them a firefight just remember theyre wearing flak jackets and youre better off shooting for the head
8632282 you need to go back and get a tie everybodys wearing a tie
8632283 there are a few people without ties that group of japanese visitors

8632287 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
8632288 im pleased to have derrick signed and have these contract negotiations behind us
8632289 this was a long and challenging process for the player and for the team this was a good example of the problem commissioner goodell has cited with the lack of a rookie pay scale were all happy that derrick can now focus on getting on the field being a jaguar and contributing to this team
8632290 we welcome derrick and will work hard to get him up to speed as quickly as possible
8632291 i know that derrick has been anxious to get here its good for him and also for us to have this done as we finish up the preseason and prepare to start the season
8632292 with all of our players now under contract we can move forward into the season
8632293 throughout this process derrick and his family and his agent were straightforward and wanted to get this done there were some unusual challenges and plenty of room for honest differences of opinion
8632294 we identified derrick as a player who can come in and help us and were glad to have him here and ready to go
8632295 he got a good start with us in spring practices so now he takes the next step in his development
8632296 im relieved to have the contract done and im excited to join my teammates
8632297 i allowed my agent to do his job and represent me and in the end it was so important for me to get this wrapped up so i could get here and get started

8632308 duplicated source code can be an indicator for quality problems
8632309 having the same algorithm spread across the whole application in slightly different variations will lead to increased maintenance effort which ultimately may result in inconsistencies
8632310 clone detective makes it easy for developers to perform a clone detection and visualize the existing clones however in some cases the source duplication cannot be easily removed e g the cost of removing the clones outweighs the costs of keeping them due to heavy design change requirements
8632311 in this case clone detective helps by reminding you that a given portion of code is duplicated by a purple bar in the code editor so if you make changes to it you should review the other occurrences and make sure you keep your application consistent
8632312 fuzzy clones are clones that are almost identical but not token by token this will allow you to find existing inconsistencies in your code base
8632313 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8632314 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8632315 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8632316 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8632317 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
8632318 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
8632319 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home
8632320 could this be the reason why god gave us only 10 use of our brains we would have destroyed ourselfs long ago
8632321 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50 there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8632322 this research reinforces why state farm is actively involved in advocating for laws that help prevent injuries and deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes its clear from these findings that primary seat belt laws for all occupants would help us accomplish that goal
8632323 in italy theyre happy with the result but here in bedum we are much more happy because the tower of pisa is now leaning less than the tower of bedum
8632324 research on identity within the field of psychology should broaden its focus to include a wider unit of analysis than the solitary individual
8632325 such a focus will empower parents and educators to take a more conscious positive and active though careful role in the identity formation of youth while previously such a role may have been understood and portrayed as out of bounds
8632326 this research provides evidence of the social benefits of assembling a diverse student body particularly for white students and can add to the debate over the continuation of affirmative action policies
8632327 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
8632328 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or loss of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
8632329 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
8632330 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
8632331 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
8632332 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
8632333 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
8632334 we have a system that is broken and it has been broken for a long while
8632335 thats what social workers said to me when i came into post you have to change this
8632336 it is a fact that at the moment we are not completely fulfilling our statutory responsibility
8632337 its not fair for the 178 children who are in care not to have an allocated social worker it is a piece of nonsense
8632338 there is broad consensus that the current arrangements in relation to childrens social work services need to change
8632339 referrals are increasing markedly there is difficulty meeting some statutory responsibilities and insufficient focus on preventative services for children and families
8632340 there is need for a radical review of how resources are used and how the service is organised
8632341 its imperative that every child in our care does have a social worker and it is a grave concern to me that they dont im not entirely convinced that this reorganisation is going to help that
8632342 we should be asking for more money instead of stretching the budget as far as it can go
8632343 because of this difference in behavior we can track the changes with our analytical instruments
8632344 my research group is one of the few in the world to use these techniques
8632345 any differences that are detected are due to metabolism or microbial degradation
8632346 once the path of pcbs is known how they are circulating in the food web it is likely to be something that can be cleaned up with new methods and kept out of the food chain
8632347 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8632348 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8632349 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8632350 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8632351 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8632352 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8632353 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8632354 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8632355 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8632356 who was that little guy who played for the red sox

8632364 penyidik yang menangani kasus itu telah kita periksa mereka telah melakukan kesalahan dalam melakukan penyidikan
8632365 penyidik kita salah tapi kejaksaan dan pengadilan juga salah mengapa kasus ini bisa disidangkan kalau tidak didukung fakta dan kenapa hakim juga bisa memutus mereka bersalah kalau hasil penyidikan polri salah ini yang harus kita telisuri disamping mengungkap kasus pembunuhannya sendiri
8632366 kita juga lakukan koordinasi dengan kejaksaan negeri dan pengadilan negeri jombang kita harus evaluasi kasus ini
8632367 i am really pleased with the move and looking forward to the challenge in a new city
8632368 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8632369 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8632370 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8632371 when people wish the worst on people you have to be careful because the baseball gods are going to get you guillen said he was not asking just for my job he was asking for thousands and thousands of peoples jobs over the years im not going to say i will get the last laugh because i will get fired from this job but the day i get fired is the day i lose interest in this game am i enjoying this yes because he tried to make my life miserable he did everything in his power to make my life go the wrong way but he didnt make me miserable because i dont believe him maybe if somebody else wrote that stuff about me then i would put attention on it and thats what he wanted he wanted attention he has to thank me because i gave him a lot of stuff to work with i know i helped him the last four years to make his money and obviously he did not help me at all to make my money the sun times chris de luca collected several love notes to mariotti in a column today including the above from guillen and this from white sox broadcaster ken harrelson its about time said sox broadcaster ken hawk harrelson another favorite target of mariottis i know one thing when he got that contract extension three or four months ago he wouldnt have signed that extension if the things hes saying about the sun times now were true so hes spinning it again
8632372 as we approach our 2008 season we are continuing to raise the bar for our program
8632373 we have put together a challenging non conference schedule that will prepare us for our big east conference competition and move us towards our goal of making the ncaa tournament
8632374 with a solid core of returning players we have to be consistent in living and executing our standards and expectations everyday
8632375 when our goal is to try to do our best and when our focus is on preparation sacrifice and effort instead of numbers on the scoreboard then we will put ourselves in a winning position
8632376 megan is a dilligent worker who has grown tremendously over the last three years
8632377 megs versatility combined with her experience will contribute to the teams daily successes and acheivements
8632378 although young rebecca gained a lot of match experience last season
8632379 we look for rebecca to continue to build off of her freshman year and develop a greater leadership role for us this season she has really worked and improved on her transition game this past spring and we anticipate her to be a consistent and terminating force for us this season
8632380 after taking a medical red shirt last season due to shoulder surgery lorelle is physically ready to compete for a position in the middle this year
8632381 lo has the ability to dominate at the net both defensively and offensively
8632382 her height combined with her work ethic will add tremendous depth and competition in the middle position
8632383 over the past few years kate has matured and grown as a volleyball player and competitor
8632384 we look to kate to continue to be a primary passer and become a steady and reliable offensive player for us kate will bring great intensity and match experience to the floor this season
8632385 this off season devon has worked to impove her overall game
8632386 we need dev to be an aggressive dependable attacker and continue to develop court awareness her vibrant energy and selflessness will play an integral part of our teams success
8632387 we need chauntay to be an efficient and terminating attacker
8632388 she is full of potential and has all the tools necessary to be a threatening force for us on the left side
8632389 over the past year lauren has been working really hard in the weight room and on the court
8632390 she has made significant improvements in physical strength and her defensive game this season we expect berti to be berti play hard every point every game every day
8632391 jordan is a high energy versatile player with high end potential
8632392 she has a natural feel for blocking and plays hard and high we look to jordan to raise the level of play in our gym
8632393 jessicas standards are high and she works daily to strive for excellence
8632394 we expect jess to have a great junior year she has grown tremendously as a leader an athlete and as a person her defense ball control and passing are vital to our success
8632395 her passing played a large role for us last season and we expect margot to continue to grow as a defensive player and compete for a position
8632396 she is a fiery competitor and will compete for a defensive position on the floor
8632397 we look to her to command an exciting offense this season and to lead through her competitive edge and tenacious work ethic
8632398 as we approach our 2008 season we are continuing to raise the bar for our program
8632399 we have to put together a challenging non conference schedule that will prepare us for our big east conference competition and move us towards the ncaa tournament
8632400 our ultimate goal is to have a great season and we believe that if we stay on the path that we have made for this program these past few years there will be some great honors waiting for us at the end of the season
8632401 girls can wear jeans and cut their hair short wear shirts and boots because its ok to be a boy but for a boy to look like a girl is degrading because you think that being a girl is degrading but secretly youd love to know what its like wouldnt you what it feels like for a girl
8632402 wgn radio is giving right wing hatchet man stanley kurtz a forum to air his baseless fear mongering terrorist smears
8632403 hes currently scheduled to spend a solid two hour block from 9 00 to 11 00 p m pushing lies distortions and manipulations about barack and university of illinois professor william ayers
8632404 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8632405 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves
8632406 at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8632407 i would say this is the biggest response weve ever got from a campaign or a candidate
8632408 this is really unprecedented with the show the way that people are flooding the calls and our email boxes
8632409 he got into the files just yesterday so we wanted to have him on to find out what he found and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
8632410 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well
8632411 getting the data out of the device and into the control system usually uses proprietary software that is not interoperable across platforms
8632412 parents have trusted their best assets their children to imam ibrahim and he has broken that trust
8632413 i want families to know these people are not following islamic laws they are not following american laws they claim they are serving islam but they are just serving themselves
8632414 in our culture we dont even let girls sit with their male cousins and this guy is a teacher why is this man who has said we are not even allowed to chat with a boy doing this
8632415 at the same time im thinking he is a teacher he is very famous maybe he knows something i dont know
8632416 often said women were on earth only to satisfy men
8632417 within the islamic community the family has such a high status that everyone is worried about compromising ones honor and dignity people are also afraid to give islam a bad name especially in the current climate
8632418 when i talked to the former student we realized it was almost the same story for both of us
8632419 as far as marriage and divorce that has never been there not even islamically not even from the religious point of view
8632420 marriage is just a term that we were using but we were never considering it a marriage really even she knows
8632421 if you take the islamic perspective out then you would see nothing really wrong there
8632422 i remember him saying the first time im renting this for my wife and she will be here at a later date to pick up the keys
8632423 i have told my friend to make sure he eas a lot of fruit and girl let me tell you he taste good all the time but liquor makes it taste bad i dont know about vegetarians but pineapples work well just like yogurt does for women
8632424 this is very true if you want him sweet make him eat pineapples 30 mins before oral
8632425 our primary findings suggested that smoking physical inactivity and obesity are inversely associated with awareness of the psa test these risk behaviors are linked with higher prostate cancer morbidity and mortality
8632426 the results concur with our initial hypothesis that men who adopt unhealthy lifestyles may be less concerned with health and less aware of preventive measures like the psa test
8632427 this research will demonstrate the importance of facilitating self initiated behavioural change to control diabetes
8632428 diabetes self management programs are essential in the fight to prevent diabetes complications motivational interviews are an excellent addition to strengthen this important component of diabetes care
8632429 often patients with these radiologic findings are referred for eus in lieu of waiting for repeated imaging our study looked to determine the performance characteristics of eus and or eus with fna in diagnosing a pancreatic tumor in this patient population
8632430 we found that eus and or an eus fna for diagnosing a pancreatic neoplasm was 99 1 percent accurate with 88 8 percent sensitivity and 100 percent specificity
8632431 barack obama and i have an honest disagreement on the issue of abortion
8632432 but the fact that im speaking here tonight is testament to baracks ability to show respect for the views of people who may disagree with him
8632433 and i believe that as president hell pursue the common good by seeking common ground rather than trying to divide us
8632434 there was a time when the democratic tent wasnt big enough to include pro life catholics
8632435 sen caseys speaking role is a clear signal that those days are over we are hopeful that tonights address will begin to heal the deep divisions that exist in our country and pave the way for common ground efforts to reduce abortion
8632436 five men in black robes dont know better than women whats best for their health care
8632437 the police are enforcing the laws of obstructing traffic yet they wont enforce the laws against the killing of children
8632438 in 2007 at least 26 states made efforts to expand coverage but as the economy has turned downward so have state efforts
8632439 reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy too many of our neighbors are living in poverty and too many are living without health insurance
8632440 todays news confirms what americas struggling families already know that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards
8632441 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of schip over president bushs two vetoes
8632442 are expensive and when tax revenues fall it is going to be harder to keep them up
8632443 we have a much weaker economy than a year ago much higher inflation very unlikely that this trend will continue into 2008
8632444 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8632445 states such as massachusetts have also played an important role in stemming the rising tide of uninsured and thanks to their health reform law they now have one of the lowest uninsured rates
8632446 but 45 7 million uninsured people are far too many and we need a national solution to this crisis
8632447 were entirely attributable to an increase in the number of people enrolled in medicaid and other public programs
8632448 is clear is that economic growth alone will not cut it for most american families
8632449 means more progressive taxation increasing access to affordable health care investing more in public education
8632450 president bush was too busy cutting taxes on top earners to think about any of these priorities the next president must do much better
8632451 truth be told we already have a government funded health care system we just pretend we dont
8632452 theres this supposed mix of private and public insurance but the fact is the u s government you know we the taxpayers spend nearly a quarter more for government health care programs than say canada a country that is supposed to have government controlled health care
8632453 looks great until you see that whats declining is private insurance coverage and whats increasing is the number of people eligible for government programs such as medicaid
8632454 its time to organize government health care into a single payer system one that covers all u s residents
8632455 a closer inspection of the numbers shows some dark clouds around the silver lining
8632456 while total enrollment in private insurance remained stable due to population growth it eroded slightly in percentage terms continuing a downward trend
8632457 growth in coverage was mostly concentrated in public programs partially due to an aging population shifting to medicare but especially in medicaid
8632458 each year a significant portion of the uninsured qualifies for government assistance but hasnt signed up
8632459 in other words the latest batch of data shows again that the policy problem of the uninsured isnt as large as election year opportunism would have it
8632460 the genuine hardships that the fragmented health care system metes out to many families
8632461 insurance is more expensive than it needs to be thanks to regulation and other market interference
8632462 who typically have less generous plans as part of their compensation
8632463 restoring the tax parity of health dollars would allow individuals to buy policies themselves rather than rely on their employers and take those policies with them wherever they work
8632464 hepatitis b is a disease that can have a serious impact on a persons quality of life and those with the disease are more likely to develop serious liver problems such as cirrhosis and cancer the independent committee carefully considered the evidence and concluded that entecavir offered a good use of nhs resources for this condition

8632473 the bank turned in a solid performance this quarter driven in particular by a strong contribution from the financial markets segment and good growth in business volumes at personal and commercial
8632474 moreover our financial health remains excellent as evidenced by the good credit quality of the loan portfolio and our high regulatory capital ratios
8632475 our financial results in recent years have mirrored the consistent improvement we have achieved in our business and we finish the year with a stronger business
8632476 we enter the new financial year facing slowing global growth and more challenging global economic trends
8632477 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 percent
8632478 the main drivers of growth were international where scotch in latin america and beer in africa drove net sales growth of 16 percent and north america where growth in the priority brands drove a 5 0 percent increase in net sales
8632479 if it was going to have a major impact we would have seen it by now
8632480 sempre preciso saber quando uma etapa chega ao final se insistirmos em
8632481 though he slay me yet will i trust in him
8632482 to what extent are you familiar with evidence supporting evolution which has been found in the last two decades
8632483 what is your single major specific objection to seriously considering the theory of evolution
8632484 what is your single major specific objection to seriously considering that the earth and cosmos are very old
8632485 the average yec has vastly more data about the earth and cosmos than did the naturalists whose work with earlier data caused them to abandon yec and embark on the modern mainstream view there is also much more time available for work on this data even if yec scientists in other fields only worked on it part time yec has also been around a lot longer than the mainstream view given this availability of data and resources why is it that no concordant theory of yec has ever emerged
8632486 where is the flood unconformity can we drive or fly somewhere and see an examples of it
8632487 at what point for you personally does the tension between the confluence of evidence for evolution and your decision to believe in yec by faith become so great that you seriously consider accepting the theory of evolution
8632488 though he slay me yet will i trust in him
8632489 e come se di colpo tenessi tra le braccia una fiamma viva
8632490 e io non desidero altro che buttarmi li in mezzo fino a farmi consumare
8632491 more significant progress which can be measured and noticed by the customer was achieved in the field of automotive transmissions in the past ten years than in the 50 years before
8632492 at the age of seven my very first client was my two year old brother as i gave him guided tours of my dollhouses and home collages that i cut and pasted from various magazines clearly real estate is my gift and passion
8632493 like everything else in life there are times that you have to make an adjustment
8632494 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play i really think that the game has prospered for well over a century now doing things the way we did it
8632495 any time you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
8632496 theres been some concern that well if you start here look what its going to lead to not as long as im the commissioner
8632497 id love to be able to throw a red hankie or a green hankie imagine being able to throw something on the field and not be ejected
8632498 i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco initially
8632499 in this day and age where all these ballparks are being built now where people can reach out over the outfield fence and catch balls fan interference is becoming more and more of an issue
8632500 a slap in the face of umpires that have been here for a long time
8632501 it overshot the mark by far just because what in a yankee game someone didnt get a homer please its happened thousands of times
8632502 thats part of the game its the beauty of the game mistakes are made
8632503 i find it very strange that with 30 games to go in the season that they would start it now i find that very peculiar
8632504 if they wanted it so bad what took them so long to get it going and why wait until this particular point in time
8632505 some people thought that we ought to wait until the postseason
8632506 id rather go into the postseason knowing that weve already used it
8632507 so if the game is held up for a couple of minutes a couple of times a year i think thats ok
8632508 its certainly not going to be seen as often as it is in the nfl
8632509 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
8632510 i dont believe in the use of instant replay for other things
8632511 i just dont want it to open up pandoras box with calls at home and calls at the bases and eventually behind the plate
8632512 we havent talked about that i think that thats unlikely over the term of this agreement
8632513 what well obviously do is look at it after the world series were hopeful that were going to say it was great
8632514 we hope youll like this new character and we will come soon with the next in the line ss goku
8632515 theres a sign saying that you need to take your laundry out when its finished and your stuff was cooking in there already

8632530 there have been a lot of complaints about rec procedures from researchers in recent years they often find the process onerous and bureaucratic however this study is the first time anyone has systematically analysed what recs are saying about cancer trial proposals
8632531 currently food heated in a microwave loses heat to the cold dish because the dishes are transparent to microwaves
8632532 the plates are still cool when the cooking is completed
8632533 dishes heated by themselves or with food could keep the food hot of up to 15 minutes one might even cook a pizza on a plate and then deliver it hot
8632534 we used cooking oil because it is an innocuous substance
8632535 we could perhaps use this material in a closed system to decompose organic contaminants in soil or dirt
8632536 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8632537 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8632538 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice
8632539 our hope is that this work will provide new approaches for recovering function from the protein whose inability to fold and function properly compromises the quality of life and life expectancies of people with cf

8632541 people with cystic fibrosis now live longer than once ever thought possible and basic science breakthroughs like this one keep the trend ever upward
8632542 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8632543 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8632544 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8632545 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8632546 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8632547 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8632548 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8632549 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8632550 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8632551 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8632552 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8632553 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8632554 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8632555 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8632556 i dont think harper has to be thinking about a majority at all
8632557 strategically this is sort of a prolonged war of attrition
8632558 this is the largest investigation to date to compare fracture rates in hiv infected patients with those of non infected controls
8632559 this very large study group with more than 8 500 hiv infected patients and over two million controls has the power to detect significant differences in risk for both men and women at critical sites such as the hip and spine risks that increased with age

8632564 i dont want anybody thats been in my life before in my life anymore
8632565 i dont even want them to have any way of contacting me
8632566 i just love so i dont understand when people cant do exactly what i do
8632567 ever since i met del 55 years ago i could never imagine a day would come when she wouldnt be by my side i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8632568 when she spoke about obama she really did not emote very much
8632569 the only thing she showed was a very weak smile the cheeks didnt tend to lift very much it was really almost what i would call a crocodile smile where even the slight corners of the lips sometimes raise into a little bit of a smirk
8632570 i dont think that helped move the 30 percent of her supporters who say they wont vote for obama
8632571 what she did do was appeal to voters at large that she did more emotionally

8632575 after carefully assessing the situation the bureau of the organising committee for the fifa world cup today decided that the preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland will take place at a neutral venue due to the current unrest in georgia
8632576 although the georgian football federation gff had hoped to host this match at home in tbilisi it will now be played in mainz germany on the originally scheduled date of september 6 2008 with georgia acting as the host association
8632577 last week fifa had asked the gff to name an alternative venue for this match in order to be prepared should the situation in georgia still require a neutral venue
8632578 now the choices for this match were a date with jeff hardy and a playboy contract or the womens title on the line and a playboy contract and the fans have chosen a date with jeff hardy
8632579 this match is scheduled for one fall where the winner gets a playboy contract and date with jeff hardy introducing first from birmingham england she is the wwe womens champion summer
8632580 and her opponent she is a three time playboy cover girl vanessa

8632625 when considered in tandem with past actions such as squandering the parliamentary vote on so called same sex marriage failing to rein in human rights commissions run amok and not taking steps to overturn the naming of henry morgentaler to the order of canada it is clear that the harper governments initiative to squelch c 484 means it may well lose the support of social conservatives in canada
8632626 this will likely have dire electoral consequences for mr harper and the conservatives in the next election
8632627 it is unconscionable that such phenomena are not on the government agenda at all
8632628 time and again social conservatives have been let down by the harper regime
8632629 it is evident his party carries the title conservative in name only

8632640 this is the largest investigation to date to compare fracture rates in hiv infected patients with those of non infected controls
8632641 this very large study group with more than 8 500 hiv infected patients and over two million controls has the power to detect significant differences in risk for both men and women at critical sites such as the hip and spine risks that increased with age
8632642 these data indicate that we should screen hiv infected patients both men and women for low bone density as they age
8632643 we also need to learn more about the mechanisms of this bone loss whether antiviral drugs the virus itself or other metabolic factors are responsible and investigate specific fracture rates for women before and after menopause
8632644 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8632645 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8632646 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions to the contrast agent
8632647 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
8632648 these tiny transducers work together to create one large transducer working much like the compound eyes of insects
8632649 i believe we have shown that 3 d ultrasound clearly works in a wide variety of interventional procedures

8632652 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8632653 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8632654 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8632655 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8632656 it is beyond the accidents at bhopal india in 1984 and chernobyl ukraine in 1986
8632657 arsenic in drinking water is a major public health hazard and should be dealt with as an emergency

8632659 gustav is on track to pose a sizeable threat to both upstream and downstream production capacity
8632660 the impact of gustav on the downstream sector could be felt more acutely at least in the short term as there is no u s government inventory that can be released

8632696 marketers who truly care about the green thing should be scrambling right now to find a number or an organization that can defend the green brand if not its going to be worthless and a great opportunity for improvement is going to be lost
8632697 today especially our thoughts are with the families of peter and monica hughes and joan harper
8632698 they are still trying to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones but this will always be difficult without knowing exactly why this tragedy happened
8632699 this inquiry is still open and we remain committed to investigate any information that comes to our notice

8632702 i would like to appeal directly to the mother of this baby or to anyone who may know the identity or whereabouts of this mother
8632703 i am very concerned about your well being and my immediate priority is to ensure that you receive any necessary midwifery and medical care
8632704 i appreciate that you must be feeling very confused upset and afraid please be assured that i want to make sure you are safe and well
8632705 whatever the circumstances we appeal for her to come forward as she could be further endangering her welfare if she has not received the correct medical attention
8632706 because of what has happened she may be under stress mentally and emotionally so it is doubly important that we trace her as soon as possible

8632733 our hope is that this work will provide new approaches for recovering function from the protein whose inability to fold and function properly compromises the quality of life and life expectancies of people with cf
8632734 since this pivotal discovery of the cf gene nearly 20 years ago researchers have made more progress toward a cure than they had in thousands of years before
8632735 people with cystic fibrosis now live longer than once ever thought possible and basic science breakthroughs like this one keep the trend ever upward
8632736 there have been a lot of complaints about rec procedures from researchers in recent years they often find the process onerous and bureaucratic however this study is the first time anyone has systematically analysed what recs are saying about cancer trial proposals
8632737 recs are looking for evidence that researchers are sensitive to ethical issues in particular to participants interests and that information given to potential participants explains the trial fully and truthfully researchers can improve their chances of success at ethical review by really good preparation
8632738 two thirds of adverse events after a heart attack which may be a further heart attack stroke or major bleed happen after a patient has been discharged from hospital
8632739 our findings are of concern because we believe that the risk for patients whose heart attack was originally considered not as severe may be being misjudged
8632740 this does not mean to say that all patients who have had a heart attack will need surgical intervention but that doctors should carry out a simple recommended risk assessment that unfortunately is not being routinely used but which takes in a variety of factors to help work out the best treatment
8632741 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there

8632746 what you really want is a missing cell type one that is not functioning properly to be derived from something else but you only want that cell type so i think this is a really important step forward in exercising what people really wanted and showing how well it can work by this gene over expression procedure
8632747 provides exciting new insights into yet another aspect of cell plasticity that was not appreciated previously and that offers great potential therapeutically direct reprogramming represents a more straight forward strategy to treat diseases involving loss of function of specific cell populations than approaches requiring an intermediate embryonic stem cell
8632748 more than a little surprised to find that we could use a combination of just three transcription factors to reprogram one cell type into another
8632749 combined a systematic approach to identifying the relevant transcription factors hard work and a bit of luck
8632750 by asking what genes you have to have turned on in the cell for it to become a beta cell
8632751 if you want to do reprogramming it doesnt take great insight to figure out that the key genes are transcription factors the proteins that bind dna and tell cells which genes to turn on and which to turn off
8632752 and the locks are transcription factors we asked which ones are present in the beta cell and that gave us 1 100 transcription factors to choose from eventually we learned that of the 1 100 only about 200 are actually expressed in cells that are involved in forming the pancreas
8632753 we decided that of the 200 we only cared about the ones that are expressed in the key part of the pancreas where the beta cells are and that got us down to about 28 then we did some lineage studies
8632754 and we got it down to nine joe said my best guess is its these nine and he were right it was a messy experiment mixing all nine and injecting them into the pancreas then we found out that it got better and better as we removed one gene at a time from the nine and eventually we found that it actually works best with three transcription factors that six of them arent that important and thats the fun of science
8632755 if it hadnt worked with those nine wed probably have dropped the experiment and gone onto something else there would have been just too many possible combinations of transcription factors to wade through
8632756 were intrigued by the possibility that this approach which has worked for pancreatic insulin producing cells could be more widely applied to many kind of cells especially those that are lost in disease or following injury
8632757 and at the same time we are exploring the possibility of using this general approach in a clinical context to make new beta cells for patients

8632780 i am pleased with the companys quarterly topline performance driven by strong volume primarily in consumer products as well as effective pricing actions and successful new product sales
8632781 however our businesses continue to be negatively impacted by inflationary costs pressures which further accelerated during the first quarter
8632782 combating cost increases through pricing actions and productivity gains remains a critical priority and we believe we are on track to offset costs in the back half of fiscal 2009
8632783 idc research shows that power and cooling efficiency and system density are among the top concerns of high performance computing hpc buyers today escalating system sizes and sharply rising energy costs are contributing to these concerns
8632784 ecophlex technology is designed to alleviate these issues for high end hpc users and could be an important differentiator for cray as they prepare to enter the petascale computing era
8632785 most large computers today exhaust heat into the air and then the computer room air conditioner crac units have to remove the heat from the air and put it into chilled water this method is very inefficient for a petascale system the area taken up by the crac units could exceed the computer footprint wasting precious datacenter space and energy
8632786 other systems use chilled water coils embedded in each computer cabinet and sometimes even embedded invasively into the compute blades with ecophlex technology you still use chilled water but much less of it and because of our unique engineering you dont need to worry about water condensation or leakage that could harm electronic components the combination of our ecophlex technology unprecedented upgradeability and environmentally friendly design philosophy makes cray systems the industry leading green solution
8632787 attempts to improve energy efficiency often involve lower power processors or reducing the frequencies of standard processors but this requires more processors to achieve a given performance level which reduces performance efficiency and since many application codes have limited scalability this strategy can reduce an hpc systems breadth of applicability making it a more limited purpose machine ecophlex technology allows hpc sites large or small to enter the muli petaflops era tackle the most daunting science and engineering problems and apply large numbers of high performance processors at industry leading densities while achieving strong energy efficiencies on a broad spectrum of applications
8632788 in addition to its cooling technologies cray continues to provide environmentally friendly multi generational cabinets to our customers most of whom have already upgraded two or three times in the same cabinets for a dramatic tco advantage
8632789 all too often buying the next generation supercomputer from a vendor requires a forklift upgrade replacement of the cabinets the hpc buyer bears the substantial added cost of the new cabinets and the old cabinets often have to be trucked off at some cost to a landfill with a negative environmental impact

8632799 red lord surprised me a little with just how well he won last start
8632800 he has done very well since and i expect him to run up to that form again
8632801 he is heading to the metropolitan handicap and then hopefully to melbourne
8632802 of the two zavite is probably the one who is bred to be a cups horse and i expect improvement from him
8632803 he got bumped at the start in the liston but was getting to the line okay at the end of the race
8632804 now that hes been gelded all that relentless energy seems to have disappeared and he is concentrating on his work
8632805 red lord has a bit more brilliance and has also matured this time around
8632806 i asked the owners if i could spell her and race her again and they chose not to send her to stud and its been a blessing
8632807 she is a very special mare and is much stronger than last time i had her
8632808 her trials have been very pleasing and she really hasnt put a foot wrong in her preparation
8632809 shes drawn barrier 10 but shes got the speed to overcome that and nash will have her well placed
8632810 shes like a little bunny rabbit the way she skips over the ground and you will find a very competitive sliding cube on saturday and i have no doubt that she is the horse to beat in the race
8632811 he is in very good shape and i think he could run boldly first up in the concorde
8632812 he was disappointing on saturday but now that hes getting older i think he is better suited over shorter distances
8632813 on the other hand it will probably be too short for spy zaim but he needs to start somewhere
8632814 its unfortunate for blake but we know that glen will do a great job and were looking forward to the race
8632815 the other day she just lost concentration when she hit the front and that showed a little bit of immaturity more than anything else
8632816 but shes very focused and will benefit enormously from the last run and it has already brought her on you can see the improvement in her work
8632817 she impressed me from day one and that win had a lot of merit
8632818 she showed toughness and plenty of ability and is a really special filly who i have no doubt can turn the tables on desuetude
8632819 her build up to the race is spot on and i could not be more pleased with her
8632820 he has done that before but he then got injured and didnt go on second up but it was very encouraging i must say
8632821 hes still a run or two off his peak but hes where i want him to be at this stage of his preparation
8632822 i dont think theres any doubt that hes capable but statistics show that hes never won second up and hes never won at less than a mile 1600m so i doubt whether that would change at weight for age
8632823 it does depend on the weights and where the young guns are going so well wait and see at this stage

8632855 thank you for writing to inquire about receiving pbs hd in your area im sorry for any frustration this causes you and im happy to respond to your e mail
8632856 while i do not have any information specifically about pbs in your area we do value programming like this and realize pbs in hd is important to our customers unfortunately due to limits in bandwidth we are not able to offer all of the local channels we provide to the salt lake area in hd i have entered a request for pbs hd to be offered in your area our programming department take channel requests like yours into account when deciding on new programming to offer
8632857 as mentioned in our previous e mail we are launching new satellites to increase the number of hd channels that we are able to offer it is possible that pbs hd may become available at that time however i wouldnt want to speculate on any dates for this or our service provided by other companies
8632858 thank you for your e mail at this time we do not have specific information when the pbs stations will be launched in hd we are currently working on offering more hd channels in the future please log on to our website for more information about new programming and services being added to dish network

8632862 shes first up from a spell and goes great fresh
8632863 i havent won too many of these grand slam matches so this feels pretty good
8632864 it was really about self belief i am feeling more and more comfortable in best of five set matches and i thought i handled it pretty well today
8632865 i played him twice this year already and its one all he beat me pretty convincingly last time so hopefully i can get a bit of revenge
8632866 i had a really good match against james blake at the olympics i feel like i can keep this roll going
8632867 if i did it would just be a distraction so theres no point once you get on the court you can only do what youre capable of
8632868 its in the back of my mind its going to be an interesting tie for us and a tough one because chile are always difficult to play down there but well go in with good spirits and well do our best
8632869 lleytons not going to be around forever and were going to have to learn to deal with that eventually
8632870 thats a good strategy during the match but it was almost over he realised it was kind of a mistake
8632871 im not going to go for someone up 6 2 6 2 5 2
8632872 it was a bad miss but it was a miss i hit very hard to end like that it was a little disappointing i can understand where he was coming from and i probably would be a little ticked off too
8632873 id spent 10 years in italy and i learnt a lot there
8632874 im happy that i started my career in that country but it was just getting a little bit stale there
8632875 italy is still an important country to play in but the english premier league had something special that i wanted to be involved in
8632876 id made up my mind to leave italy obviously it wasnt that simple but blackburn made an important offer and im happy to be here
8632877 theres a certain enthusiasm about all the stadiums of england the way that the people enjoy their football i think the clubs have invested a lot of money in bringing in the top players and they have improved the football as a consequence
8632878 it is an enthusiastic league to watch the opportunity was there and i thought it would be good to measure myself against such a good league
8632879 at the same time i firmly believe that every adult human being should retain the right to make his or her own decisions in life whether correct or not

8632882 but he wanted to go into horses not the stud side because he felt that was my area
8632883 as with everything john does though his research was meticulous
8632884 we were in paris and john wanted to listen to redoutes choice race over the phone
8632885 being 2am in the morning i passed on the opportunity and he went to a friends room he came back and said im going to buy that horse

8632893 christenson said the obama campaign was asked to have someone appear on the show and the headquarters declined the request
8632894 he got into the files just yesterday so we wanted to have him on to find out what he found and if at all possible we wanted to get the obama campaign to get their side of the story
8632895 thats why the uproar is kind of amazing because we wanted the obama campaigns take as well to kind of balance it out
8632896 het probleem is dat er weinig controle is op het internet

8632907 vintage bill clinton no question about it he made the case very succinctly for why barack obama will be the next president of the united states and why john mccain doesnt deserve an opportunity to continue four years of bush policies
8632908 a great speech outstanding as i said earlier today i expect for bill to be bill and he was bill tonight i really believe that he teed it up well for barack obama
8632909 i enjoyed the irony of it i think first it was a strong speech effective he did what hillary clinton didnt do last night which was to make a direct personal endorsement of barack obama but i had to feel the irony and i was chuckling at it i tried to look at it through the lens of hillary clinton sitting there in the audience thinking theres kind of the good bill clinton and the bad bill clinton for a year bill clinton had screwed up his wifes campaign now the good bill clinton shows up to hit a strong triple for barack obama the irony in that is tremendous i think
8632910 i think by all accounts the democrats could not be happier right now the barack obama supporters heard exactly what they wanted to hear from the former president of the united states
8632911 i thought the clinton speech was a great speech and it was considerably better than the one he made when he nominated me in atlanta when bill clinton announced for president in the fall of 1991 he went on
8632912 it was a comprehensive almost legal argument like a closing argument of a trial in support of barack obama he covered almost everything put it all together into one argument
8632913 i think he pointed out when he ran for president people questioned his readiness that he was too young those were eight pretty good years for the economy and we had peace and prosperity so look we cant afford four more years of weve had economically we just cant particularly out in my part of the country and overseas we need to restore our credibility and world leadership and i think that bill clinton made a pretty good case of that you see that the democratic party is coming together with bill and hillary clinton leading way for barack obama
8632914 he did he layed out just how much is at stake and helped lay the groundwork for the vision that barack obama will talk about to the country tomorrow night he left absolutely no doubt about where he would be and were going to be fired up and ready to go for the rest of the general election cycle
8632915 biden i have to say gave especially his attacks on john mccain probably the most effective i think weve heard in any of the speeches given and he speaks with an authority that most people lack which is the fact that he knows mccain well that they go so far back that they have such a close relationship that they are friends
8632916 joe bidens speech was ham and cheese man i can take that speech and send it to every county commissioner in america and hear you can get up and repeat that at the rotary club
8632917 i thought it was a fine speech it was a serviceable speech i dont think its a memorable speech it will never make bill safire s anthology
8632918 when we were walking out i whispered i said i have a surprise for you and then dad popped up and it was touching because they were genuinely surprised and they miss him terribly and you forget how much they miss him but malia our oldest was very touched she cried backstage because she worries about him shes worried that hes in a good place it just still breaks me up but they were excited
8632919 how much of it did you write how long did you rehearse that
8632920 well lets start with the speechwriting much of that speech comes from my stump that ive been doing for basically a year and a half and im also one of these people i dont like last minute so we sort of got our speech together about a month ago actually and got to sort of live with it and so that you know i mean those were my words
8632921 what of the attacks has busted through to you what makes you angriest at john mccain the republicans whats being said about your husband you want to shout from the mountaintops is not true
8632922 i definitely can connect with cindy mccain i feel like i can connect to anyone i can connect to her more as i get to know her know her story you know i try not to make with anyone any broad sweeping stereotypes about anyone based on what you read or hear in the paper one day cindy and i when this is all over im sure well have a chance to have a conversation as two people as two women and ill get to know her story and shell get to know mine thats how relationships are built and it doesnt matter what party what race what gender
8632923 relations with the bidens this is tough because its a meet your new other family how is it going and what do you expect
8632924 the person that brought it to my attention did ask does that mean if youre mute you cant play golf on the lpga tour
8632925 do you have to pass an exam who draws the line about how many words youve got to know in english
8632926 unless the state of texas violates their own election laws congressman barr will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot
8632927 we are up against them constantly in our fight to get on the ballot across the nation when we miss deadlines we get no second chances this is a great example of how unreasonable deadlines chill democracy
8632928 republicans and democrats make certain that third party candidates are held to ballot access laws no matter how absurd or unreasonable
8632929 therefore republicans and democrats should be held to the same standards

8632945 the work at cathedral camps is very physical one of the tasks that i really enjoy is to clean staircases in cathedrals which often leads to hidden doors and places nobody has seen for probably ages
8632946 i would recommend cathedral camps to any young person you meet new people at every camp and it is great to spend time in such unusual locations
8632947 cathedral camps demonstrate the positive impact that young people make in helping to protect our architectural heritage

8632954 it took a while for the break to go but when it did we seemed to get a minute or a minute and 30 seconds right away
8632955 it was not the best situation with all their teams having their best guys there but there was complete cooperation from all the guys in the break it seemed like everyone just wanted it to come down to a sprint finish from among that group

8632961 as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee biden is well versed in policy debates and carefully choreographed trips but his record on the islamic republic of iran perhaps the chief national security threat facing the next president suggests a persistent and dangerous judgment deficit
8632962 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
8632963 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
8632964 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas naive understanding of the iranian threat an obama biden ticket has proven that it is ill equipped to deal with this threat by selecting senator biden to join his ticket voting for senator obama has now become an even greater risk

8632990 i am confident that some of younger players that we have spent a lot of time with this off season are going to really push to be on this team

8632993 for everyone who poured their time energy and creativity into the making of this project i give my sincerest congratulations
8632994 it basically comes down to how frequently theyre having symptoms and how much the symptoms are affecting their life
8632995 avoiding caffeine eliminating fatty or acidic foods losing excess weight and quitting smoking are all things patients can do to control their acid reflux
8632996 if people are having symptoms on a daily basis or more than three times a week we usually recommend they start medication
8632997 most patients suffering from mild acid reflux will treat themselves with over the counter medications
8632998 antacids are better for immediate relief like after a big meal because their effectiveness is short lived in nature and only lasts for as long as its in the system
8632999 you should see a doctor if your symptoms are not controlled by over the counter medicines because it could be a sign of a more serious condition
8633000 carafate is a liquid suspension that essentially coats the inside of the esophagus its short lived in its effectiveness because once the coating wears off its not going to do much
8633001 we really only prescribe it for people who have symptoms less than a couple times a week or month
8633002 h 2 receptor blockers work by shutting off the production of acid in the stomach
8633003 they are effective for mild reflux theyre relatively inexpensive and can be used casually by people who only have symptoms a couple times a month
8633004 the standard of care for treating gerd and related digestive diseases has become proton pump inhibitors and because they are so safe these are the most common medicines

8633009 desde que se dio a conocer el pacto entre el pp y sp estamos asistiendo a un espect culo m s que lamentable por parte de los concejales tanto del pspv como de eu
8633010 hace mes y medio a los socialistas sp no les parec a tan mal compa ero de viaje en su intento de realizar una moci n de censura al actual al alcalde
8633011 no supieron jugar sus bazas e intentaron en todo momento ir de listillos en lugar de tratar de t a t a una fuerza como sp que les iguala en n mero de concejales
8633012 con su p sima negociaci n demostraron los malos pol ticos que son y ahora nos dan muestras de su baja catadura moral
8633013 se produjo el mayor crecimiento urban stico de la historia del municipio y las acusaciones que esgrimen tanto el pspv como eu bien se las podr an aplicar ellos mismos
8633014 no merecen unos representantes como los que tienen en el ayuntamiento ya que hacen de la mentira y la crispaci n armas con las que manipular de forma malintencionada a la opini n p blica
8633015 para nada este pacto nos ha pillado por sorpresa lo que sorprende y el pp tiene la obligaci n de contestar es si como afirman los concejales de sp sus socios de gobierno este pacto otorga legitimidad a la segregaci n
8633016 los nicos que orquestaron y ejecutaron una moci n de censura fue el pp con un cuatripartito en el a o 1997 contra el alcalde socialista manuel girona y del que ya formaban parte segregacionistas como garc a felipe y marcelino gil

8633039 the injury wasnt affected by the period of extra time
8633040 he was playing with pain before and he kept going today because he knew he was going to see the surgeon tomorrow its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8633041 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard
8633042 when you play these kind of games the other team is playing and training just thinking about this game
8633043 brians dedication and guidance over the years has helped many printers in their quest for managerial excellence it is only fitting for brian to be honored for all that he has given to the graphic communication industry

8633048 we are delighted by the addition of skrebbass range of staplers to our portfolio like the rest of the products we supply they are built to an extremely high standard and are incredibly cost effective compared to their competitors the staplers are perfect for enhancing the presentation of printed documents features such as ease of use small footprint and portability mean they lend themselves well to a variety of commercial print on demand business structures found on the high street as well as education and corporate in plant operations
8633049 we are now at a stage with our daily titles where we need to increase color capacity to fulfill the requirement for editorial and advertising content our ht70 presses have proved very reliable and produce excellent color quality the most logical and cost effective solution for us is to use the existing units from press number 1 and reconfigure them to fit into presses 2 and 3
8633050 this interesting project makes the best use of the current press equipment at dpc istanbul facility we have worked at a number of sites in the group in recent years and have proved that our project management skills and ability to work with the customer to come up with unique solutions that fit its business plans are second to none
8633051 this is more than a minor update it is a collection of feedback from the industry and associations over the last 3 years that was incorporated in the gwg v4 specs
8633052 the main interest was the reduction of unnecessary restrictions like the use of double byte fonts or to ignore elements completely outside the trimbox on the other hand the check for image resolution or line width was adopted to reflect todays printing capabilities
8633053 with our generation the work ethic is part of our culture and our dna and now were living healthily well into our 80s we want to continue being employed
8633054 i was at a very large engineering insurance company for 40 years and decided to take early retirement at 60
8633055 i didnt miss the content of the last job but i missed the people
8633056 it was a change here it is physical and ive lost some weight as well which im happy about im enjoying myself thoroughly
8633057 for a 200 investment weve made we got featured in the local newspaper once twice on tv and its the buzz around town i cant get a quarter page ad for 200
8633058 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
8633059 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
8633060 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
8633061 we canceled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
8633062 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
8633063 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
8633064 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
8633065 the amount of time ive spent being interviewed about all the good things were doing and only hearing about the gas thing on the news is a little disappointing
8633066 women smiled gazed swayed giggled licked their lips and aided and abetted by the wearing of high heels they swayed their backs forcing their buttocks to tilt out and up and their chests to thrust forward

8633068 immediately considered all the possible risks and vulnerabilities they might face if they mated or had children theyd run screaming from the room
8633069 love signals a practical field guide to the body language of courtship
8633070 my team and i put together the idea of the mortgage adoption center as a service for our past clients
8633071 but as we started to put the program together we heard story after story from friends and family members of clients who hadnt heard from their mortgage broker in years or had been told about home mortgage loans or loan refinancing opportunities that actually hurt their long term financial goals these stories in addition to the current state of the loan industry compelled us to offer the service to all homeowners free of charge to help those homeowners whose loans have been abandoned by their loan professional
8633072 we are incredibly proud to offer the refinancing alert service at http mortgageadoptioncenter com and look forward to helping its users save money and time in refinancing their home mortgage loans
8633073 my girlfriend and i had an argument about this and i really need to know something from you what in the world does cvs stand for anyway
8633074 oh cool you actually knew that now i just have to remember that all the way to the car
8633075 which it does cus its sweden in 1973 and love between men and women is riven in confused pathological psychological head fuckery
8633076 here are a bunch of crazy ideas that are wrong and here are people who introduced the modern ideas
8633077 theres way more that we can offer than we could before
8633078 we really tried to address all of the line issues we had before
8633079 we lost that old grade school seating where all of the tables were lined up and the same size
8633080 we tried not to throw anything away that people could use
8633081 it was an awkward setup because we were doing resident dining in a place that wasnt built for it
8633082 we were setting up tables in the back as people were coming in the front
8633083 the current project is an amazing feat to get done in 18 weeks
8633084 we applaud the county representatives for their decision to nullify these unlawful policy changes
8633085 the nyclu is deeply devoted to ensuring that lesbian and gay people receive the health care coverage they need to protect themselves and their families everyone deserves fair and equal treatment under the law
8633086 county residents concerned with this anti lgbt amendment contacted us immediately to find out the law and how they could help restore a sense of fairness in the county
8633087 many county residents were reassured to know the law rests on the side of fairness and they immediately stepped up against anti lgbt bias volunteering to read the nyclus letter and testify against the amendment
8633088 my involvement in tsg and my friends are what kept me here at temple
8633089 our whole goal is to get more of the student input and student voice into the tsg meetings
8633090 tsg is definitely going to be the voice of the students
8633091 we came in with a vision and we knew what we wanted to do and now were leaving it up to the students to tell us what to do from here on out
8633092 the three of us together i feel like we make a really great team
8633093 since i came to temple ive fallen in love with the school
8633094 im definitely passionate and i definitely know we can do more
8633095 one thing that has been instilled in the tsg environment is helping to build future student leaders
8633096 when i came to temple i did not plan to be the president
8633097 for me it was knowing that i could do more by learning from everyone else
8633098 dont be afraid to open yourself up and learn something new every day
8633099 get it from gandhi be the change you want to see at temple
8633100 im definitely trying to leave a legacy but its not my main goal
8633101 its to reach those one or two students who said i could never do something if i can just motivate those one or two students thatd be a great accomplishment
8633102 i may be signing off for now but we are always on at cbs3 com for my now tarnished career im larry mendte goodnight everyone

8633105 contemporary society is faced with a monumental array of tragedies on a daily basis perhaps one of the most tragic is the situation of a parent accused of killing their child a tragedy compounded when it is a mother accused of killing her infant there is currently a case being decided by a judge in guelph a verdict is expected today in which a woman is charged with the murder of two children in two separate incidents in both cases the children were only weeks old the defence argued that the deaths should be considered infanticide rather than murder such a crime is so unusual in our sophisticated society that we might do well to consider the historical origins of infanticide in order to reflect upon the relevance of such a charge and whether it is an appropriate alternative to murder
8633106 i could never share this with another person not the same way that i do with you

8633810 this weeks events served as a national debut of sorts for the obama campaign attack machine even if that machinery is operated mostly by supporters and aides rather than the candidate himself
8633811 it was clear that the campaign has settled on its favorite theme portraying mccain as out of touch economically and an identical twin to president bush
8633812 his campaign has gambled on the historic moment by creating a stage that will magnify his performance
8633813 i know one hundred percent how busy he is and i dont expect to meet him this week or anytime soon

8633833 reducing health inequities is an ethical imperative social injustice is killing people on a grand scale
8633834 there is no good biological reason why this should be the case
8633835 these health inequalities are preventable they arise from the circumstances in which people are born grow live work and age the social determinants of health
8633836 taking action to deal with preventable causes of illness means taking social action a toxic combination of poor social policies unfair economic arrangements and bad politics is responsible
8633837 the commission considers health care a common good not a market commodity
8633838 the commission advocates financing the health care system through general taxation and or mandatory universal insurance the evidence is compellingly in favour of a publicly funded health care system
8633839 we are distressed by the reports we see of healthcare simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay and we see that throughout lower and middle income countries
8633840 not for me to tell one of the richest countries on earth how it should organise its health care system
8633841 its not perhaps the best use of money thats being spent there are a lot of people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current presidential campaign in the us proposals for a universal health insurance

8633845 am incercat o colaborare electorala cu pcm si cnmt pentru a realiza o solidaritate cat mai mare a comunitatii maghiare din transilvania aceasta colaborare nu s a realizat nici la alegerile pentru parlamentul european nici la alegerile locale noi am castigat alegerile locale cu un procentaj de 85 in randurile maghiarimii
8633846 am inclus principiile pe baza carora vom colabora campania pe care o vom face impreuna o serie de puncte concrete pe baza carora am fi putut colabora in anexa avem oferta udmr cu locurile de deputati si senatori oferite celor din cnmt doua locuri eligibile suta la suta si alte locuri din care ar fi rezultat mandate un alt text se refera la infiintarea unui for politic de coordonare maghiara care ar fi avut menirea sa asigure un cadru de consultare pentru udmr cu grupari politice din afara textele au fost pregatite pentru semnare deci sunt definitive
8633847 dialogul nu l am incheiat vom incerca sa discutam dar in ceea ce priveste dialogul privind listele pentru alegerile parlamentare am inchis discutia
8633848 mai ales ca aceasta grupare nu are o sustinere prea mare
8633849 exista o grupare mica care a iesit candva din udmr pentru ca nu a reusit sa se impuna si incearca o alternativa politica in afara probabil ca scopul lor este acela de a sparge udmr interesul lor nu este o colaborare

8633951 the health inequities we see in the world are absolutely dramatic in their scale
8633952 between countries we have life expectancy differences of more than 40 years a woman in
8633953 one of the recommendations in the commissions report is that there should be universal health care systems that are available to people regardless of ability to pay
8633954 virtually all advanced countries have universal health care systems but we dont think that should be limited to high income countries we think that could be much more broadly available
8633955 we are distressed by the reports we see of health care simply being unavailable to people because of inability to pay we see that throughout low and middle income countries
8633956 its not perhaps the best use of the money that is being spent and there are a lot people who feel that and would actually like to see coming out of the current campaign in the u s proposals for a universal health insurance
8633957 the importance of prevention continues to grow partly because of escalating health care costs we simply cannot afford the way we go about doing health care nowadays without tackling and doing more prevention

8634023 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8634024 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession

8634034 the thing we were dealing with was not only two good quarterbacks but two good people and the last thing they would do was try to do anything that would hurt their football team and i think everybody is right out there for everybody to see we went by the action on the field and the action on the field is both quarterbacks did some good things both do some things that give you an opportunity to win that was never an issue here
8634035 one the quarterbacks have to build their credentials with the players and really thats done long before practice starts during the offseason program where they build credibility with their work ethic their commitment how they interact with their teammates all three of these players have done a really good job with that
8634036 you just try to keep it from becoming a sideshow and something that is of interest to other people but really not nearly as much interest to the participants on the team so weve tried to maintain an air of calm and sanity around the process the distractions come from outside frankly much more so than they do from within the locker room and within the team

8634080 we are working hard to iron out glitches before it goes out to users this is not about security issues
8634081 instead of delaying the launch of the database this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether
8634082 a recent independent review has already undermined all of the governments assurances that the database will be secure the discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future the government has proven itself untrustworthy with large databases containing sensitive data parents have every right to demand that their childrens personal details are not put at risk
8634083 may allow a situation where an abuser could be able to access contactpoint for illegitimate purposes with limited fear of any repercussions
8634084 the enormous size of the database and the huge number of probable users inevitably increase the risks of accidental or inadvertent breaches of security and of deliberate misuse of the data which would be likely to bring the whole scheme into disrepute
8634085 this looks like further evidence of the chaos at the heart of government we repeatedly warned the government of the problems with contactpoint but they pressed ahead regardless ignoring our calls to allow time to sort them out
8634086 there were clear indications in february of significant security concerns with this database only now with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems ministers now need to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because childrens personal information is at risk

8634101 we have begun to face problems what will the situation be like when all the fm broadcast license holders come into operation in the capital
8634102 almost all the fm stations face the same problem and listners are complaining about disturbance while tuning in
8634103 as radio frequencies are a limited natural resource we cannot do anything except stop issuing new licenses for fm radio in the valley
8634104 in the near future we will be forced to stop issuing licenses outside the valley as well
8634105 the disturbance in the frequencies has occurred due to the lack of a frequency spectrum plan on the part of the government the government distributed fm radio licenses without studying the nature of the frequencies and the impact on existing fm stations
8634106 besides this the government time and again even ignored our suggestions to rectify the disturbances
8634107 most of the fm stations do not use harmonized transmitters and nepali people cannot afford digital radio which captures radio signals better
8634108 in our context the ministry should have taken into account our geographical complexities while distributing frequencies
8634109 it is encouraging to find that political leaders have understood the importance of fm radios in the country they seem to have acknowledged the contribution of fm radios during janaandolan ii
8634110 radio frequencies have been distributed in an unscientific manner the government must formulate certain regulations to ensure effective frequency distribution
8634111 the government recognizes advertisements published in little known newspapers but it does not give recognition to such contents broadcast on fm radio which are far more effective mediums than such papers
8634112 improvements in media conditions after the king relinquished control were indisputable
8634113 outside of kathmandu though members of the press faced continued threats and harassment by local government officials criminal groups and particularly maoist cadres

8634115 with this being a long weekend due to the labor day holiday we dont want people overlooking the potential for a landfalling tropical system on labor day or early next week
8634116 enjoy your weekend but be mindful that you also need to take this time to get your home family and business prepared for what could be the most significant tropical system to affect our area since hurricane ivan or dennis
8634117 many people will be buying supplies for the labor day holiday for cookouts and other family gatherings why not also take the opportunity to buy additional supplies for your family in case gustav takes aim at our area
8634118 it is always better to be over prepared than not prepared at all
8634119 take the necessary steps now to make sure you and your family are ready for whatever situation may arise
8634120 you know whats worth than that is that you dont give a shit
8634121 and whats really wrong is that youre more upset that i said shit in a chapel than that those kids are dying
8634122 give them ownership help them grow make sure their voice is heard

8634132 if theres one hip hop act thats absolutely perfectly suited for mike pattons great indie label ipecac its d lek upon first listen to any d lek album theres nothing subtle about the music whatsoever the lyrics recited in a clear direct manner by the groups namesake are pointed and unflinching part street poet part visionary part psychotic homeless sidewalk pontificator the man is going to make himself heard damnit and nobody had better try and stop him or therell be hell to pay the music is equally hard edged but when it first kicks in it couldnt sound more harsh boasting a sound thats both bottom heavy and eardrum piercing producers still and oktopus assemble a cacophonous pastiche thats equal parts throbbing gristle new kingdom and my bloody valentine crating some of the scariest hip hop music to come out since trickys masterful one two punch of maxinquaye and pre millenium tension what starts off as sounding jarring and atonal however somehow seeps into your bloodstream and takes on a strangely warm quality the lugubrious hypnotic beats resembling a sedate steady heartbeat the turntabling and basslines forming a warm numbing wave of sound and all the while d leks lyrics overwhelm you with their passion and poeticism thats the genius of this new jersey trio the music is so deceiving its far from noise
8634133 i am pleased with the companys quarterly topline performance driven by strong volume primarily in consumer products as well as effective pricing actions and successful new product sales
8634134 however our businesses continue to be negatively impacted by inflationary costs pressures which further accelerated during the first quarter
8634135 combating cost increases through pricing actions and productivity gains remains a critical priority and we believe we are on track to offset costs in the back half of fiscal 2009

8634142 lonnie told her he loved her and he would be in a lot of trouble for the things he was doing to her
8634143 based on the information from that interview we developed probable cause
8634144 the more opportunities i have with the ball in my hands i feel like i get more relaxed and i get more of a feel of the game and that helps to slow it down a lot faster for me
8634145 when im running around and blocking but not getting the ball as much i feel like im in the game but not really in the game
8634146 going to try my best to hold it down for him
8634147 basically that just keeps my attention off of whats really happening
8634148 we always tell them the same thing play hard play and smart and have fun
8634149 we want them to relax to some degree and calm down
8634150 things are going to happen they are thats the nature of football and the nature of life you have to work through that and think positive thoughts when bad things happen you put it behind you and move on
8634151 and hes still kind of getting there a lot of people dont realize this is going to be his fourth year playing football
8634152 but just watching the kid run around from the first day he was here he was very impressive with the ball in his hands he wasnt always running the right way but he was making guys miss and he was making a lot of plays
8634153 ive seen him in games he has a big leg
8634154 i was surprised they didnt play the whole thing out
8634155 maybe im the worlds most gullible guy but i was completely surprised
8634156 i know it was one of the hardest speeches shes ever had to make in her life
8634157 a lot of people are upset about what area they can sit in
8634158 after attending two training sessions ive not done much i spent all day last thursday at the dia motor pool i helped place signs in the chevy sedans that were assigned to specific vips then checked each for full gas tank and if they needed washing the only signs of people i recognized were for speaker nancy pelosi and former president bill clinton

8634168 em 2006 houve na argentina uma campanha semelhante ao programa atual do brasil
8634169 constatou se a presen a do hcg em v rias amostras da vacina usada contra a rub ola a suspeita que ocasionou a investiga o foi iniciada pelo fato de que havia muito poucos casos da doen a na argentina esses casos n o mereciam uma campanha de grande escala
8634170 a idade das pessoas que ser o vacinadas de 12 a 49 anos para as mulheres idade reprodutiva e entre 12 e 39 anos para os homens
8634171 as idades para as mulheres s o as mesmas idades para aquelas que receberam as vacinas na nicar gua onde inclu am um horm nio que esteriliza a mulher que o recebe e semelhante idade daquelas que receberam outro horm nio esterilizante nas filipinas
8634172 se o objetivo da campanha realmente eliminar a rub ola ent o por que vacinar quem j foi vacinado
8634173 por que obrigar a vacina o de quem j teve a doen a fato mais que comprovado que a pessoa que j teve rub ola nunca mais a ter
8634174 nas campanhas de vacina o em massa na argentina nig ria filipinas e outros pa ses o unicef mostrou que sabe aliar as piores inten es com as apar ncias mais angelicais

8634177 it shoots 1280 720p video at 24fps with a 16 9 aspect ratio for up to five minutes producing around a 600mb file its essentially recording the live view feed which gets its own button so focus is locked because the mirror has moved out of the way and you get mono sound the major appeal is that itll work with any of your lenses so you can do wacky hd clips with a fisheye lens on the relatively cheap or be artsy and use a shallow depth of field
8634178 for the first time in digital slr photography nikon introduces the addition of the d movie mode allowing consumers to create their own hd movie clips 1280 x 720 with sound from their d slr camera photographers will appreciate the cinematic qualities that come from the 24fps frame rate which matches theatrical film whether producing vacation clips or creatively melding stills with video additionally the large size of the d90s dx format sensor combined with the optical superiority and broad selection of nikkor lenses provides shooters with the ability to capture amazing perspectives not possible with typical camcorders d movie clips also benefit from nikon vr image stabilization which is automatically activated during recording to aid the low light capability that trumps many other hybrid devices users can record movie clips onto an inserted sd sdhc card created as motion jpeg avi files that are easily edited with widely available video editing software the d90 also features an hdmi terminal allowing viewing of both pictures and movies on high definition television
8634179 those cameras will have to be banned period they will never be allowed into any olympic venue

8634183 ik heb gekregen waar ik voor ging de provincie wordt op de vingers getikt
8634184 de rechtbank stelt ook vast dat het voorval van 31 maart 2004 waarbij maximaal 5 3 ton etheenoxide ontsnapte meteen gemeld had moeten worden de rechtbank acht het ten laste gelegde feit wel degelijk bewezen maar ontslaat shell van rechtsvervolging vanwege de afspraak met de provincie let wel dit is de praktijk in alle provincies niet alleen in brabant de wet is heel duidelijk dit soort bedrijven moeten alle incidenten hoe klein ook melden in zeeland zeiden ze laatst nog tegen mij als jij je zin krijgt dan krijgen we honderden meldingen per dag dat willen ze niet de rechtbank heeft de wet in ere hersteld dat is goed het ging er mij niet om dat shell moest hangen maar de provincie kon ik niet vervolgen omdat die geen strafbaar feit heeft gepleegd
8634185 ik ben blij met de uitkomst niet met de incidenten waar het over ging die hadden niet mogen gebeuren

8634193 the mehdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group
8634194 this group of girls have been working together for two to three years now not only in season but in the offseason as well they have come together and now are finally jiving
8634195 i think this is finally the year that we are ready to show what we have worked so hard to accomplish
8634196 our younger starters have shown great maturity and will combine well with their older teammates
8634197 i look forward to having a very competitive season with the experience of our senior leadership working with our up and coming players
8634198 the girls are all committed and dedicated to the overall program
8634199 we hope to bring an overall uplifting spirit to the gym
8634200 there were a lot of issues in longmont that i felt needed to be addressed and was really happy to see how things grew there
8634201 i am very happy with the chivington drive issue because that was tried before
8634202 if you dont like the issues we are involved with thats fine
8634203 but if you like the constitution if you like the bill of rights then you should be concerned about what is going on down here
8634204 it is time for dacono to take a stand in this matter and say no to the mill levy and bond
8634205 we need to make it very clear that we believe we are being shorted overlooked and discriminated against
8634206 we have to acknowledge the difference between the bond issue and the mill levy
8634207 the mill levy money goes to the kids our kids i think youre wrong here mr mayor
8634208 i think they need to get their own house in order
8634209 i was elected a year ago with the goal of getting a school for dacono it is appalling the way the school board has treated dacono dacono is for their kids and they dont deserve to sit on a damn bus every single day
8634210 i used to go watch their games all the time because my sister melissa was on the team
8634211 thats when the program kind of picked up the senior class has done a lot of good things since we were freshmen
8634212 of course everybody wants to win state their senior year and thats definitely my goal too
8634213 we belong at state hopefully well do some damage there
8634214 but we want to respect everybody we play and take every game one at a time we know what were capable of
8634215 we have a lot of weapons on the floor and an experienced group of athletes running the offense
8634216 we definitely bring a big offensive attack and well be hard to beat defensively as well this year
8634217 all of us have a bad taste in our mouth with how last season ended
8634218 it was really disappointing because we had the potential to get further and we knew it i wouldnt say we looked past districts or anything like that it was just a shock
8634219 it was the hardest thing to watch all the other teams win we felt like we belonged there too
8634220 its hard being good because we dont want to lose to anybody

8634269 one of the hardest things weve had to do here is taking off our party hats
8634270 this is outrageous the people of idaho are entitled to have their representatives base their votes on the merits of a bill not on who backed the loser in a speakers contest

8634290 we are witnessing the development and acceptance of a new moral code in america
8634291 mosaics have had little exposure to traditional moral teaching and limited accountability for such behavior
8634292 the consistent deterioration of the bible as the source of moral truth has led to a nation where people have become independent judges of right and wrong basing their choices on feelings and circumstances it is not likely that america will return to a more traditional moral code until the nation experiences significant pain from its moral choices

8634317 men know how to mine silver and refine gold to dig iron from the earth and melt copper from stone men know how to put light into darkness so that a mine shaft can be sunk into the earth and the earth searched and its deep secrets explored into the black rock shadowed by death men descend on ropes swinging back and forth men know how to obtain food from the surface of the earth while underneath there is fire men know how to find sapphires and gold dust treasures that no bird of prey can see no eagles eye observe for they are deep within the mines no wild animal has ever walked upon those treasures no lion has set his paw there men know how to tear apart flinty rocks and how to overturn the roots of mountains they drill tunnels in the rocks and lay bare precious stones they dam up streams of water and pan the gold but though man can do all these things they dont know where to find wisdom and understanding they not only dont know how to get it but in fact it is not found among the living

8634320 although the plague vaccine is still experimental in wildlife we hope its use during this epizootic will protect as many ferrets as we can capture in the field and boost ferret survival during this critical period
8634321 weve had experience with burrow dusting in other areas and we know dusting protects both species from plague during these outbreaks
8634322 what were trying to do in south dakota is assess the protectiveness of the vaccine for prairie dogs and ferrets during a full blown eruption of plague that is causing high mortality in the prairie dog population

8634339 mesej yang hendak dihantar oleh pengundi melayu cina dan india menjadi sia sia kerana abdullah tidak ada telinga untuk mendengar tidak ada mata untuk melihat
8634340 kamu boleh terus sokong abdullah sebagai presiden parti tetapi rakyat tidak akan sokong umno kerana ia sudah jadi alat abdullah dan keluarganya
8634341 apabila datang pilihanraya ke 13 rakyat akan jatuhkan umno dan bn kerana hanya dengan cara ini sahaja rakyat akan dapat jatuhkan abdullah
8634342 dengan berat hati penyokong penyokong bn telah mengundi pkr supaya abdullah akan sedar yang kepimpinannya tidak dikehendaki lagi
8634343 wang yang banyak telah ditabur atau dijanji akan ditabur pekerja bn dibayar saguhati calon yang diletak sesuai juga
8634344 apakah yang tidak kena dengan bn sehingga pengundi memberi kelebihan undi yang lebih banyak dari bulan mac kepada anwar yang enggan bersumpah isu liwat
8634345 untuk pulihkan sokongan kepada umno dan bn abdullah perlu bertanggungjawab dan letak jawatan sekarang

8634349 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8634350 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8634351 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8634352 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8634353 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8634361 il libro prende partito per due tesi principali la prima riguarda la diffusione della cultura nonostante gli allarmi lanciati da alcuni intellettuali la cultura non ha mai goduto di una salute tanto buona come nella societ dei media sia per la disponibilit degli strumenti sia per la capillarit della penetrazione sociale la seconda tesi concerne invece il destino della cultura nel prossimo futuro quello che a taluni appare solo come un amaro crepuscolo a me sembra lannuncio di una stagione segnata dallaffacciarsi di nuovi saperi di nuovi pubblici e di nuove dinamiche che per ora possiamo cogliere solo in parte sostituire allidea della civilt quella della decadenza quando non della degenerazione unoperazione quanto mai sospetta e del resto basta scorrere qualche millennio di storia per ritrovare il periodico riaffacciarsi del terrore per le orde barbariche di turno
8634362 a guardare con occhi liberi da pregiudizi ai processi culturali che hanno scandito i decenni che abbiamo alle spalle si copre che la cultura ha conosciuto una penetrazione sociale che quanto alla sua capillarit non ha alcun precedente
8634363 una delle maggiori contraddizioni con cui si trovano a misurarsi i critici della cultura di massa riguarda il carattere fortemente elitario e discriminatorio della grande tradizione classico umanistica che essi oppongono allesecrata industria culturale i grandi libri sono infatti maturati allinterno di orizzonti culturali dominati dalloppressione e dalla violenza tutta lalta cultura reca un drammatico imprinting di classe dir di pi ha coperto giustificato e sostenuto sistemi che perpetuavano lautoritarismo e la repressione chi condanna senza appello la strumentalizzazione operata dallindustria culturale mostra spesso una strana amnesia a proposito di quellumanesimo che nel promuovere un universalismo riservato a strettissime lite ricorda un po la democrazia ateniese quando sento parlare con nostalgico rapimento dei sistemi in cui luomo era misura del mondo mi viene sempre di chiedere quale uomo il signore o il servo
8634364 pur non ritenendo come fanno alcuni che la societ occidentale sia una gigantesca cospirazione contro la cultura e la letteratura va riconosciuto che negli ultimi decenni qualcosa di importante avvenuto qualcosa di cui non abbiamo ancora piena consapevolezza ma di cui sperimentiamo ogni giorno le conseguenze indubbiamente la cultura che aveva costituito il nutrimento delle nostre adolescenze e giovinezze stata archiviata nei ripostigli dello specialismo dellaccademia della ricerca e delleditoria specializzata insomma si definitivamente museificata se questo fenomeno di obsolescenza traspare in modo pi visibile dal mondo della scuola solo perch i giovani sono termometri pi sensibili e registrano con ingenua e generosa immediatezza una disfatta che impareranno poi con gli anni a stemperare nellipocrisia delle ritualit culturali il teatro le mostre i concerti di musica classica magari qualche presentazione di libro qualche dibattito e qualche conferenza qualcosa di simile a quello che si fa con la natura nei parchi e nelle aree protette buonismo e rimorsi da riserva indiana
8634365 un sapere autoreferenziale sterilmente autoriproduttivo che solo materia di studio e ai nostri studenti non serve pi per decifrare se stessi e il mondo
8634366 that is ruthless reckless brainless and heartless and i will describe him or her as a wild animal

8634369 have heard the masses limit a man to but one death
8634370 some people refer to me as a taker of lives perhaps a murderer if you care for such coarse labeling
8634371 have you ever been told youre beautiful my sweet little flower
8634372 i would presume you have men have such a way with words in regards to such charming ladies as yourself
8634373 i for one die every day you see i have no choice for i am a man of faith i stand for morals and the benefit of all manki bwhahahaha
8634374 oh sorry this is awkward but the other day i slipped on a charming fellows small intestine i missed a rather miniscule part and the irony just hit me cause i missed a small piece of the small intestine you see
8634375 ah but of course i constantly have to better myself and die daily to my
8634376 faults you see the world is place of disease despair complete lack of care
8634377 and i am but a fire here to refine the strong and engulf the weak
8634378 i find it rather judgmental of the masses to throw around terms such as murderer or serial killer merely because the weak thrust themselves at me like a pair of hips at a young beautiful lady such as yourself
8634379 perverts is what this world is full of you see perverts and pervetes as i like to call them pervetes is my own little word for harlots whores sluts sinning little lusting daughters of lucifer
8634380 et cetera so you see my little damsel in a slightly discomforting situation
8634381 i am not a soldier of god nor am i lowly peasant like servant i am much more like gods right hand assuming gods right hand was his executing hand of course
8634382 hmm i expected a much grander spinning hover like affect but it doesnt end there
8634383 im also like gods left hand of course assuming that gods left hand is his torturing hand here to strengthen the weak for the torture that is life as you can see i am very multifaceted in my works for the lord thats enough about me lets talk about yourself my little ray of sunshine
8634384 ryan why were you screaming open this door young man

8634391 as the dew falls on the blade you have touched all this fragile frame and as a mother knows her babys face you have known me as the summer air within my chest i have breathed you deep down into my breast and as you know the hairs upon my head every thought and every word ive said saviour you have known me as i am healer you have known me was i was and as i will be in the morning and in the evening you have known me you have known me completely you have known me and as the exhilaration of autumns bite you have brought these tired bones to brilliant life and as the swallow knows she knows the sky this is how it is with you and i from the fall of my heart to the resurrection of my soul youve known me god you have known my ways in my rising and my sitting down you have seen me as i am as the lover knows his beloveds heart all the shapes and curves of her even in the dark you have formed me in my inward parts you have known me you have known me

8634396 we want our customers to be satisfied with every aspect of their shopping experience at zamberg com including knowing that their personal information is safe when they shop with us thats why we choose to go with comodo a brand that many consumers trust to secure their pcs this brand recognition gave us immediate credibility with many more site visitors than ever before
8634397 zamberg com has been able to convert increased trust into increased sales because it overtly demonstrates how much it values the security of its customers i look forward to the day when we can trust everyone on the internet as much as zambergs customers can trust them

8634400 this increasing political dominance in the sector is already destroying the spirit of impartial community media
8634401 only 10 percent of the fm stations registered as community radio meet the criteria if strictly followed
8634402 radio stations may become tools to provoke disputes between communities and groups in the villages its high time we paid enough attention to this
8634403 they should present things as they are without going for their own interpretation
8634404 this whole thing has been awful but what hurts me the most is the betrayal
8634405 i dont want my show to be open university but i do want it to be interesting as well as entertaining
8634406 lets say its half way between open university and a booze up in a pub
8634407 it used to be okay just to do a biography of these people but with dylan in the same way as elvis or the beatles it is very hard to encapsulate his whole life in one book i mean how do you sum up a guy who had a number one album 42 years ago and then another one last year its an immense subject thats why now writers focus on one specific aspect of his life
8634408 although 1967 was a quiet year for dylan publicly behind the scenes he was doing this incredibly good work its very similar to smile because some of it took years to come out and came out in the wrong order
8634409 im pretty good but im not even a quarter of what rod can do so it should be a great night watching a great musician perform some great tracks

8634422 the academic epicenter of this years presidential election isnt as in some years past harvard or yale its located between baltimore and philadelphia at the university of delaware
8634423 schmidt is one of the most forceful successful and unconventional political operatives of his generation running one of the most uphill gop presidential efforts in decades yet he is hardly known outside political circles
8634424 a tightly controlled message delivered repeatedly and with almost military like precision
8634425 a talent for devising a campaign strategy staying with it under fire and doing what it takes to win
8634426 as for plouffes public profile in a campaign inner circle marked by facelessness no senior aide makes a greater point of avoiding public view than he does
8634427 yet he has a hand in virtually every aspect of obamas world field organization advertising and fundraising including the delicate task of drawing erstwhile hillary clinton supporters into the fold
8634428 the most disciplined and focused person i have ever met in politics it is very easy to get distracted by the press and donors and activists david just has a great filter and he doesnt let any of the noise bother him in a presidential campaign thats a rare talent
8634429 it was a lie from the beginning throughout the war and even today
8634430 we voted them in to end this war theyve not done that we want our brothers and sisters to come home now not later now
8634431 my buddys in the foxhole with a bullet in his head

8634435 graeme shouldnt have played in the oval test match but he is such a hard guy and a driven person
8634436 we realised he couldnt go on any more we need him fully fit for australia in december
8634437 defining a woman let alone women from africa is no easy task we are strong willed caring supportive and professional through what we do we give life building the strength of a nation and guiding its future leaders while the brief seemed simple the execution required a great deal of thought and a unique view into the life of women in south africa
8634438 initially we were going to use various images of south african women both well known and not to communicate the role and importance of women in our society as this idea developed forward it became obvious that creatively the idea would work better as a purely graphic treatment
8634439 understanding this we then looked at various ways in which words describing the roles of women could be brought together to create a woman and in so doing the message of what makes a woman would be clear the end result was a simple concept that spoke for itself a wall themed illustration of words being written to create the image of an african woman the woman would be distinctly african in her shape as well as the style of typography and the rich african colours used

8634443 the only guy on the other side whos qualified is john mccain
8634444 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off be well off no matter who
8634445 ive been calling for more troops for over two years along with john mccain and others subsequent to my saying that
8634446 look the truth is the four major things he called for well hell thats what i called for biden said today on msnbcs
8634447 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
8634448 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8634449 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
8634450 if iowans believe campaign funds and celebrity will fix the debacle in iraq put the economy on track and provide health care and education for americas children they should support another candidate
8634451 but im confident that iowans know what i know our problems will require experience and leadership from day one empty slogans will be no match for proven action on caucus night
8634452 when this campaign is over political slogans like experience and change will mean absolutely nothing the next president has to act
8634453 sen obama said he would do everything possible to end the war in iraq and emphasized the need for a political solution yet he failed to show up to vote for sen bidens critical amendment to provide a political solution in iraq
8634454 declaremos juntos en una sola voz aqu mismo ahora que barack obama ser nuestro presidente

8634457 in the 2 years ive been here weve hired very heavily and clearly at some point in time you need to slow that down
8634458 it doesnt involve reducing people but it does certainly involve slowing our expense growth over what its been historically

8634464 the light had turned green but i saw something out of the periphery
8634465 then this pickup is barreling through the red light at about 70 or 80 mph and i start yelling dont dont dont no no no and he did
8634466 today we had a lead on where he was at
8634467 while officers were going to that location they saw him driving this vehicle a dodge pickup

8634553 it is essential that our top legislators regardless of party understand the importance of victory in iraq the consequences of defeat and the success of the surge
8634554 sen obama has said that he would still oppose the surge if given another opportunity and has pointed to every outside factor but the surge to explain improvements in iraq we hope he will listen to the veterans who have served there and support this important resolution for the sake of the troops

8634556 our economy and various sectors including agriculture carry a rather heavy burden
8634557 we hardly feel any benefits from this it does not mean that we should reject russias strategic movement towards the wto but we need to have clarity in relations with our partners
8634558 inform our wto partners that russia would pull out of agreements that conflict with its interests
8634559 obligations that we feel are detrimental to our economic growth until russia becomes a full fledged member of the wto
8634560 so each side opts to pull out of agreements that benefit the other side more
8634561 the wto is something that russia isnt very interested in from the start the organization is going through a crisis its not about to fall apart but trade relations are very difficult right now and we cant rule out the possibility that the wto might become paralyzed
8634562 of course a military campaign always has a negative effect but what is happening with our stock market is related to what is happening on international financial markets

8634566 i understand the democrats are trying to use the politics of envy and i dont think that works the politics of jealousy or envy or a sense that somehow were going to be less likely to vote for someone because theyve achieved economic success
8634567 i think growing up as a military brat traveling around as a soldier and even being homeless for five years in a prison the notion that he is somehow above the american people is going to fall flat

8634582 he told me hes an insomniac and that its hard for him not to sleep in his own bed he also mentioned he hadnt had company in a while he said he had an early meeting with the yankees and he might be allergic to the pillows in the hotel bed
8634583 i practically begged him to explain what i did wrong i told him i deserved some kind of explanation for such a dismissal but i never heard from him again

8634611 competent qualified and trustworthy enough to serve as protectors would produce a sufficient number of courageous souls willing to lead the charge into blazing hell and take some gaping chest wounds for the team
8634612 the coach and the sports director want the player to stay and i am sure he will
8634613 he is a fantastic player i saw a lot of him last season watching the spanish games he had a very good season until he got injured and it broke his season up a bit
8634614 he has great flair and something that would be nice to bring into our team we have flair players already but he is another option and he could light up the league
8634615 the problems of fleet must be solved on basis of two legal facts the first fact is a signing of a special agreement on the fleet
8634616 secondly the black sea fleet is an integrated part of the russian armed forces which are subordinate to the supreme commander in chief everything else are emotions and i dont want to comment on them
8634617 it is slow in terms of getting anything done because were trying to get decent players off other teams i expect a flurry over the weekend though and hopefully were involved in it
8634618 hopefully we can get one or two players into the squad and there may be one or two players that move on as well as a consequence of that
8634619 it wont be difficult to pick the players up because it happens to quite a few teams
8634620 i dont want to be disparaging towards the carling cup but the premier league is the most important thing for every club in it
8634621 but we did try to beat northampton and every player in there and there were a lot of highly paid players in that dressing room didnt do what was expected of them
8634622 its a case of first and foremost letting yourself down there were players in that team who have been disappointed at not playing so when they get their opportunity they have got to show that they are worthy of a place and that didnt really happen
8634623 with the ones who have been playing they took their foot off the gas a little bit and its a disappointing way to lose the game
8634624 around september last year things started to go bad i finished a contract and it took me seven months to get another one
8634625 there were two or three instances where i would be waiting for my next contract to start but then i would be told that the company i was working for no longer had the money to go ahead
8634626 fuel costs have risen to such a point that i cant afford to take jobs where travelling is involved
8634627 money has become so tight with road tax going up on my transit van that i am trying to downsize
8634628 the scottish government have helped the fishermen with fuel costs i think its time the uk government helped out small businesses
8634629 everybody says that were going into a recession but i think weve been in a recession since last year
8634630 ive had to take a 50 pay cut and im using the last of my savings to keep the business afloat
8634631 i hold mr brown entirely responsible for this corporation tax has gone up fuel costs have gone up and the rates i am paid are going down
8634632 i am pleased with the companys quarterly topline performance driven by strong volume primarily in consumer products as well as effective pricing actions and successful new product sales
8634633 however our businesses continue to be negatively impacted by inflationary costs pressures which further accelerated during the first quarter
8634634 combating cost increases through pricing actions and productivity gains remains a critical priority and we believe we are on track to offset costs in the back half of fiscal 2009

8634652 it smells like there was a dead body in the damn car
8634653 the people were right that said i should have left her in there
8634654 you know the car was parked next to a dumpster i would hate to think the worst god its terrible to think shed be at the local garbage dump its terrible to think that
8634655 after reading it i dont believe i would have talked my nephew tony padilla into posting the bond and i dont think i would have come to orlando after reading that i mean im still hoping that little girls alive but theres a lot of information in those 400 pages that would lead those people to believe something different
8634656 cold callous and a monster who doesnt care whos just trying to get away with something
8634657 may not be the way we or the way your family last remembers her we need to find out from you where caylee is this this this right now is just this has gone so far down hill and this has become such a mess
8634658 we need to end it its very simple we just need to end it
8634659 i agree with you i have no clue where she is
8634660 what is given can be taken away everyone lies everyone dies
8634661 caylees out there somewhere and her rotting body is starting to decompose
8634662 i know my mom will never forgive me im never going to forgive myself because theres that chance that i may not see caylee again and i dont want to think about that
8634663 gave caylee to someone that you dont want anyone to find out because you think youre a bad mom or something happened to caylee and caylees buried somewhere or in a trash can somewhere and you had something to do with it
8634664 the longer this goes the worse its gonna be for everyone everyone
8634665 those times when youre looking at your bank account and you aint got much money
8634666 but at the same time i dont regret it at all because that time will still come ill still be able to do what i want to do as far as the financial end goes im just having the time of my life right now every time i think of something i could be doing right now in the nfl i think of the enjoyable time im having here
8634667 with all of the relationships ive had and being selected captain i guess losing two national championship games that kind of motivates you a little bit also
8634668 i get asked that a lot by friends do you ever regret your decision
8634669 i havent looked at that once its something i knew basically going into the national title game where my heart was i knew my heart was here the only reason it took a while to kind of announce it is i wanted to be sure that i covered all my bases
8634670 its more just kind of like what fits you best
8634671 going to the nfl league is not what i wanted i wasnt ready to be an adult and i dont think ill ever be ready to be an adult
8634672 besides what would this place do without me it would probably be so serious
8634673 when you make that decision to come back you know theres always a chance that you can get hurt
8634674 you have to realize that if its meant to be its meant to be you cant play being cautious thinking man if i get hurt im going to lose money im going to lose my draft status youve got to go out there and give it your all

8634684 she asked him what he thought about the whole experience
8634685 he told her that he thought of it as seven years of wasted life that neither he nor they had accomplished anything and he wished hed gotten out at the beginning
8634686 but what about the contribution we made to the overall struggle for armed struggle and revolution in america
8634687 ive done a lot of other sports but this one took all precedence
8634688 its all about pushing yourself to the limit of perfecting something in a short amount of time
8634689 being a part of the group is all about routines in the air staying together synchronized and focusing on precision

8634692 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8634693 and president bill clinton reminded us what its like when you have a president who actually puts people first thank you president bill clinton
8634694 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama
8634695 like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8634696 together we prevailed in our campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8634697 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8634698 it took a while to get here but i was very impressed with the strength of his endorsement
8634699 the program is in intensive care surviving only on massive infusions of other peoples money
8634700 john mccain should know that i want a national version of what his vp nominee signed as governor
8634701 mitt romney should explain all of this to john mccain

8634704 projektet med at bek mpe dansk folkepartis indflydelse var og er en d dssejler og det har nu tvunget partiet til at s ge efter nyt v lgerpotentiale

8634706 det skred der er sket er i virkeligheden fra et socialt engagement over til markedsorientering og konomisk fokusering navnet siger jo i en eller anden forstand det hele
8634707 hvor liberal alliance tidligere var relativt midterorienteret er de nu rykket godt til h jre partiets holdninger til velf rdsstaten skattetrykket og udl ndingepolitik placerer faktisk liberal alliance til h jre for venstre

8634710 we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ
8634711 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
8634712 i have come that they may have life and that they may have it more abundantly
8634713 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
8634714 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord
8634715 there is a way that seems right to a man but in the end it leads to death
8634716 but your iniquities have separated you from your god your sins have hidden his face from you so that he will not hear
8634717 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man jesus christ
8634718 for christ died for sins once for all the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to god
8634719 but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us
8634720 here i am i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in and eat with him and he with me
8634721 yet to all who received him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of god
8634722 that if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
8634723 everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved
8634724 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast
8634725 he who has the son has life he who does not have the son of god does not have life i write these things to you who believe in the name of the son of god so that you may know that you have eternal life
8634726 however when he the spirit of truth has come he will
8634727 i am the lord your god who teaches you to profit who leads you by the way you should go
8634728 the advanced methods of teaching in the world to be studied in the academy from the incubation stage to secondary one according to the international system in arabic english and other languages for students excelled

8634739 we share with all our neighbors and friends i think the lord has blessed this garden every year because we share

8634741 i dont know anyone around here that has one bigger than i have
8634742 i dont even know what you call them but i dont think you can buy that seed anywhere
8634743 i take the seeds and stick them in flower pots and set them out on the porch in the spring i usually just know when the time comes to do it
8634744 when you grow it yourself you know what youre eating
8634745 when we can we know whats in there you dont know whats in that stuff you buy from the store
8634746 because the end result is so far down the line youre never quite sure youve got it completely right

8634749 it started as a lark but ive really gotten into it
8634750 after riding at metroparks i started talking to judge bill littlejohn who was also interested in cycling and we got to talking about forming a club
8634751 we told other people and word of mouth grew among african americans in the community who were cycling but couldnt find each other
8634752 this year we officially formed our club named for marshall w major taylor a big name in the black cycling community who was a champ in the late 1890s
8634753 someone will schedule a ride at least once a week and we have monthly rides
8634754 we post the rides and people show up im really proud of the people who have increased their level of cycling and we want to get more young people involved
8634755 there will be a youth ride of five miles for families and a moderately challenging ride of 22 7 miles for more experienced riders
8634756 the hardest part is getting on the bike most people still remember how to ride and new technology in bikes makes it so much more comfortable for all ages

8634824 the interest was mostly from bass players at first but marcus and stanley have both ventured way outside of projects oriented toward bass players
8634825 there are people who know marcus from his miles davis or his luther vandross days or from doing some tv scoring or the saturday night live band so his audience is pretty broad ive been fortunate enough to open for the grateful dead hopefully when the three of us come together its big news
8634826 theres musical virtuosity and some simple things that are just musical we wanted to make a record that someone can listen to three times over and not be bored weve always tried to do that with the flecktones and with my own solo records
8634827 i dont remember any bass player playing with that kind of fire just attacking the bass
8634828 when return to forever came out it was something totally new that was right down my alley it was after stanley that i realized who marcus was
8634829 people know stanley for what he does a lot of times up in the higher upper range with his tenor bass or piccolo bass marcus is fat and on the bottom usually my sound is kind of patterned a little after both of them from growing and listening to both of them and it fits somewhere in between
8634830 theres always been some minor problems like having goals tipped over but its never been this destructive in the 12 years ive been involved
8634831 somehow the public needs to become more aware of this
8634832 these are very unfortunate incidents and we are aware that vandalism in general is a growing problem
8634833 well be looking to our new police chief to lead the way on this

8634847 with the corevalve revalving system a new heart valve can be implanted from a small hole made in the groin and therefore there is no need for major surgery or an incision in the chest
8634848 patient recovery is much quicker and the procedure can be performed on patients who are at very high risk or not candidates for traditional heart valve surgery this procedure is truly a revolution in cardiology and is part of the trend toward less invasive treatment
8634849 currently percutaneous aortic valve replacement pavr is used for carefully selected high risk patients only but if good long term results are sustained pavr may substitute for traditional aortic valve replacement surgery in more patients
8634850 we are gratified by the continued clinical acceptance of our revalving technology the smallest percutaneous system currently available the extensive clinical experience we have in europe where we are the market leader will greatly facilitate the introduction of our revolutionary technology in the pacific rim and other regions throughout the world additionally several scientific presentations regarding our technology and clinical data are scheduled at the upcoming european society of cardiology esc meeting in munich germany

8634984 the loss of agave plants has reduced our inventory but we do not believe this will constrain our ability to build our tequila brands to their full potential
8634985 i am pleased with the companys quarterly topline performance driven by strong volume primarily in consumer products as well as effective pricing actions and successful new product sales
8634986 however our businesses continue to be negatively impacted by inflationary costs pressures which further accelerated during the first quarter
8634987 combating cost increases through pricing actions and productivity gains remains a critical priority and we believe we are on track to offset costs in the back half of fiscal 2009

8634992 interest in capstones c200 product has been very strong as illustrated by the 67 c200 units and 55 c200 equivalent units in c1000 series product in backlog at the end of the last quarter
8634993 management originally planned on building 28 c200 systems in calendar year 2008 we later revised that number to 48 c200 systems before the end of calendar year 2008

8634995 the second production c200 is scheduled for shipment to utc power corporation for integration with their carrier double effect absorption chiller
8634996 the financial consequences of an outage somewhere in the faa network not to mention the disruption of business and personal travel can be severe
8634997 the direct and indirect financial toll can quickly reach millions of dollars in higher fuel expenses lost landing revenue increased employee costs and spoiled perishable cargo not to mention the disruption of airline schedules passengers missed business meetings canceled vacations and so on this award by the faa is evidence of their commitment to passenger safety and convenience
8634998 taken by themselves faa facilities are comparable to some of the most demanding mission critical data centers in the world
8634999 but when you take a data center and then add air traffic displays communications and weather tracking equipment you end up with something far more complex than youll usually find at a server farm these are the types of installations that paladin live is designed for and were eager to show the faa how dramatically we can help them improve the resilience of their facilities

8635029 how stupid is that that announcement made my head spin making a dark and gritty superman movie because dark knight made a ton of money is incredibly stupid

8635042 credi per comprendere il credere apre la strada per entrare nelle porte della verit ma anche inseparabilmente comprendi vedi la verit per poter trovare dio e credere
8635043 la presenza di dio nelluomo profonda e nello stesso tempo misteriosa pu essere riconosciuta e scoperta nel proprio intimo non andare fuori afferma agostino ma torna in te stesso nelluomo interiore abita la verit e se troverai che la tua natura mutabile trascendi te stesso tendi dunque l dove si accende la luce della ragione proprio come egli stesso sottolinea allinizio delle confessiones la sua autobiografia spirituale ci hai fatti per te e inquieto il nostro cuore finch non riposa in te la lontananza da dio equivale allora alla lontananza da se stessi
8635044 e questo il suo disegno fondamentale la sua interpretazione della storia la lotta di due amori amore di s sino allindifferenza per dio e amore di dio sino allindifferenza di s alla piena libert da s per gli altri nella luce di dio
8635045 noi abbiamo sempre bisogno di essere lavati da cristo che ci lava i piedi di nuova conversione fino alla fine abbiamo bisogno di questa umilt che riconosce che siamo peccatori in cammino finch il signore ci da la mano definitivamente e ci guida alla vita eterna

8635062 manchester city can exclusively reveal that shaun wright phillips has rejoined the club
8635063 the fans favourite agreed personal terms after completing a medical this morning thursday and joins on a four year contract following an undisclosed deal being reached with chelsea
8635064 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8635065 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8635066 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8635067 that germany is still in better shape than most other eurozone economies
8635068 the clock for the german labour market is literally ticking it is only a matter of time before the economic slowdown will be felt
8635069 we expect clearer traces of the economic slowdown to become visible later this year
8635070 was in line with the trend established over the past two years
8635071 to fall modestly further during the latter months of 2008 and possibly even in early 2009 despite the dampening influence from the slowdown in economic growth
8635072 there has been no excessive hiring in the current cycle
8635073 the labour market has become more flexible mostly through deregulation of temporary employment
8635074 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8635075 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8635076 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving

8635078 the commission sets closing the gap as a goal for the whole world and produces the evidence on how health inequities are a reflection of the way we organise society and distribute power and resources
8635079 the good news from the report for australia is that it provides plenty of ideas on how to set an agenda that will tackle the underlying determinants of health and create a healthier australia for all of us
8635080 this report and our own australian research indicates a desperate need for governments to provide leadership based on listening and engaging with aboriginal communities and leaders to take real action to address the social determinants of health in a systematic and structural way

8635106 it will probably take us two or three days to get around andre smith
8635107 everybody in the country knows the history of fresno state
8635108 from people i know who are more familiar with west coast football they say this is pats best team in 10 years
8635109 its not exactly what i was looking to do right out of the gate because i knew he had a very good football team
8635110 we were trying to find a division i a opponent and there werent many out there and one thing led to another and we ended up with a game
8635111 its a good chance to see how good we are
8635112 im the same guy as a head coach as i was an assistant im not going to get all hyped up and charge out of that helmet and trip and fall and embarrass myself
8635113 hes probably our most valuable player outside of hes a backup running back the starting slot hes a kick returner he has a great head on shoulders he could probably go in there and play quarterback were going to do more than throw bubble screens to him were going to try to get the ball to him downfield were going to get the ball to somehow hes going to be exciting
8635114 that wasnt a very good night thats for sure that was a long night
8635115 right out of the box the guys understand the importance of it theyve talked about it all year long and theyve talked about it in training camp im sure its the same situation over in lexington right now i like opening up with this game
8635116 rhode island is one of 16 states to offer the financial football game to its high school students
8635117 the game is a great vehicle for students to learn about financial fundamentals combining an exciting video element with instruction that helps our younger adults tackle their financial future
8635118 having played college football at harvard this financial version of the game is much less taxing on the body
8635119 however its the mind that gets a workout in this game and that bodes well for the future as these young adults learn what it takes to be successful in the world of finance

8635121 the fans favourite agreed personal terms after completing a medical this morning thursday and joins on a four year contract following an undisclosed deal being reached with chelsea
8635122 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8635123 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8635124 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8635125 we have commissioned kpmg to do a report on the equestrian shooting and basketball venues looking at whether the olympic experience and the legacy they will provide represents value for money
8635126 when you take the costs for these venues it seems like a lot of money to a lot of people it is a sort of testing to destruction to see whether that spending can be justified
8635127 ir gave us a solid foundation and we have built a tremendous system on top using links page structure and many other such innovations
8635128 thats a judgment call that comes with experience here are a few guidelines not carved in stone rules but guidelines you can consider and no dont do them all every time

8635137 i have a verbal from nc state too they are waiting to see how i do this season
8635138 i have started to receive more interest from marshall and south carolina neither have offered quite yet but they are showing a lot of interest
8635139 they are planning to come to my games this fall they both said its a good possibility they could offer they like me as an athlete
8635140 i havent really talked to ecu much but i like the area there
8635141 i really like the school and coaches they are great guys
8635142 we are a strong team we are strong on the offensive side of the ball and have a bunch of key players on defense too
8635143 it all started when i went to the reebok all american camp then it got going pretty good down at the aau nationals
8635144 coaches started to know who i was and as nationals went on more and more coaches starting to show up
8635145 the visit to harvard was really nice i really liked their campus its in the middle of boston but you didnt really feel like you were in boston it was nice and quiet
8635146 northeastern was really nice they are also in the city but its completely separate at the same time
8635147 maybe rutgers but we dont have anything set up yet
8635148 i think the next couple of weeks are going to be big for my decision
8635149 i think ill be able to know a lot about what i really like after those two visits i like northeastern quite a bit now
8635150 i was talking to my aau coach and i wanted to go up north and be able to play against my competition especially against big fellas the competition around here in baltimore is pretty much just all guards
8635151 im always the focus of the other teams defense i wanted to go up there to new hampshire where ill be playing with and against other division i players its going to get me ready for college playing against those guys its going to be much better its going to be like college i want to be a missing piece to someones puzzle
8635152 i think this is going to give me a big advantage because you arent going to be around your families you are just working out going to school and playing basketball you dont have many choices on other things to do
8635153 so that is going to help me a lot because im down here with my friends when i get up there im going to be more focused and more ready to play basketball with my new basketball family
8635154 i feel like i can do my homework a little better if i wait to sign i can go online and check out the school a little more see their roster see their record who is committed there who will be there when im there what players they will have i want to do my homework
8635155 oklahoma because they are losing most of their big men im just waiting for the right time and waiting to see what happens from there
8635156 in texas in the 2005 06 school year 16 5 percent of ninth graders the highest rate of any grade didnt complete requirements to advance according to a texas education agency report
8635157 people just really value having our ninth graders have a chance to develop intellectually emotionally and socially outside of the context of a large comprehensive high school setting
8635158 they dont have upperclassmen in the halls picking on them and teasing them
8635159 i think that most of us in the state have always been looking for ways of addressing the dropout issue and keeping our students engaged
8635160 it didnt take a great deal of convincing that this was a most positive approach to take with the student population
8635161 its the point where you can very clearly predict whos eventually going to drop out
8635162 it isnt replicating the practices of a large comprehensive high school in a stand alone ninth grade
8635163 the key there is making sure that youre facilitating the communication between teachers and administrators in ninth grade who are preparing students for eventual promotion
8635164 the whole philosophy behind it was to separate the younger kids from the older kids to give an opportunity to work with them one more year as opposed to cutting them loose in high school
8635165 you get a sense of knowing everybody that youre going to school with
8635166 but its not like youre secluded from everybody else you still get to interact and see how it will be next year in high school when you go there
8635167 this is now another step in there in terms of kids transitioning from one school to the next and all that that implies
8635168 they can be a little more silly without that older peer influence

8635171 nothing in this act shall be construed as permitting the censorship of the internet
8635172 the commission is not the final judge to decide what is good and what is bad for malaysians
8635173 the commission and the government should acknowledge that the problem at hand is the failure of the mainstream media to fulfil its duties in reporting information adequately truthfully and fairly
8635174 under the multimedia super corridor msc bill of guarantees the government promised there would be no censorship of the internet i do not understand why the skmm is resorting to this
8635175 we should let the courts decide his raja petra fate
8635176 in fact it is foolish to think that online censorship works effectively there are still many other ways for surfers to access the portal
8635177 all he raja petra has to do is to change the website address if they want to block it again they would have to issue more letters he may have lost some viewers for a couple of days but it would be back to normal soon
8635178 it is one thing when you are saying something and its an opinion but something else when you are putting it across as fact when it isnt
8635179 skmm may have briefed the minister on the issue but not me
8635180 i am aware of the issue but it is not under my jurisdiction

8635189 such agonised self destruction is the result of lifetimes of being pushed and dragged hither and yon at every step losing more and yet more of what makes any human life worth living while tribes have been wiped out remnants of tribes have been forced to amalgamate with their traditional enemies traditional lands have been alienated people of disparate groups have been rounded up and resettled in polyglot assemblages in remote communities others have been trucked back and forth from one dumping ground to another aboriginal people have lost their health their education their families their social networks their culture their religion their languages and their self esteem

8635225 we are delighted that another uk fire and rescue service has selected cadcorp sis as its gis

8635259 there are guys that people dont know that ive been in love with ive had secret lovers
8635260 i dont want to talk about it but i have definitely experienced abuse in a way that i would tell people to take their heart and run
8635261 i would walk down the school halls and hear people talking about me some of them would throw toilet paper at my house or throw eggs at my door
8635262 they would also write things on the sidewalk in permanent marker they really hated me
8635263 nightly debriefing session said mike sundin as he sipped a paper cup cocktail with his pal larry anderson
8635264 there was a quiet part in bidens speech said anderson who is an alternate delegate and therefore was seated high up in the pepsi center arena
8635265 just at that quiet part i said this is a great speech this is so un dick cheney like i didnt mean for everybody around me to hear it but it came out just at that quiet spot people around me started cheering they liked that
8635266 you sure dont do it for the fame or the power said sundin
8635267 theres only been one real bad one it was this old guy who had been a speechwriter for john kennedy i think the speech he had written was ok but his delivery was terrible just because you can write a play doesnt mean you can act
8635268 im one of those ed mcmahon hi yo guys he said
8635269 i was sitting in the alternate cheap seats with some people from maine and florida i was giving the big hi yo for all these speeches and the people around me loved it so here i was teaching people the hi yo
8635270 my wife says she hopes they take the crabby kidney said anderson downplaying his sacrifice
8635271 its because he doesnt have a lawn mower hes always borrowing his neighbors mower if something happens to that guy hes going to have to buy his own lawn mower a goat or something
8635272 you know which county had the highest percentage vote in the state four years ago asked sundin
8635273 same day voter registration we got 103 per cent you can look it up
8635274 you see those flag draped coffins and it gets to you said anderson
8635275 its personal for me said sundin whose son headed for his third tour in iraq in april

8635298 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
8635299 we are close to a serious conflict u s and nato preparations on a strategic scale are ongoing in the operation the west conducted on georgian soil against russia south ossetians were the victims or hostages of it we can see a rehearsal for an attack on iran
8635300 these missiles are close to our borders and constitute a threat to us
8635301 this will create additional tension and we will have to respond to it in some way naturally using military means
8635302 in light of the build up of nato naval forces in the black sea our fleet has also taken on the task of monitoring their activities
8635303 can nato indefinitely build up its forces and means there it turns out it cannot
8635304 if i leave georgia the russians will close our airspace and prevent me from returning home

8635412 the fans favourite agreed personal terms after completing a medical this morning thursday and joins on a four year contract following an undisclosed deal being reached with chelsea
8635413 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8635414 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8635415 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8635416 that germany is still in better shape than most other eurozone economies
8635417 the clock for the german is literally ticking it is only a matter of time before the economic slowdown will be felt
8635418 we expect clearer traces of the economic slowdown to become visible later this year
8635419 was in line with the trend established over the past two years
8635420 to fall modestly further during the latter months of 2008 and possibly even in early 2009 despite the dampening influence from the slowdown in economic growth

8635431 gerrard will have an operation tomorrow on a groin problem we knew this would happen he had a problem and now he will have an operation and he will be out for 10 or 15 days its not a big problem but he had pain and it was difficult
8635432 the injury wasnt affected by the period of extra time when he went away with
8635433 he was playing with pain before and he kept going today because he knew he was going to see the surgeon tomorrow its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8635434 we knew it would be difficult because they played well in the first game and we had to work really hard until the end for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now we scored right at the end that showed the team was working really hard
8635435 when you play these kind of games the other team is playing and training just thinking about this game but we have been bringing in players from things like the

8635437 sue sherring in the ottawa sun today takes up councillors mcrae call that a planned defence and security exhibition approved by city staff should have been brought to councils for review no freaking way should that be required
8635438 if councillor mcrae does not like the idea of having such events in ottawa then she should approach council to adopt a motion to ban such events so that staff has rules to go by in the future
8635439 ive said it before and i will say it again councils role is to debate long term strategy and to set the required parameters for the city staff to work towards those long term objectives thats the job of the 17 000 plus city staff we have on payroll if councillors dont like the results as they transpire they can change their objectives or change the staff but they cant directly interfere with the process

8635460 unestate positiva questo il commento di paolo protti presidente dellanec associazione nazionale esercenti cinema fino alla fine di luglio c stata una grande continuit di uscite i cui risultati al botteghino sono stati perfettamente in linea con quello che successo nel resto deuropa purtroppo sono mancati allappello alcuni film che avrebbero certamente contribuito al raggiungimento di un successo ancora maggiore registriamo non senza una certa sorpresa anche una mancanza di film di qualit e di titoli di medio valore che sarebbero stati utili a stabilizzare il mercato il cambiamento per lestate definitivo e ineluttabile
8635461 nonostante le differenze con il 2007 soprattutto per quello che riguarda lassenza di titoli in grado di incassare determinate cifre il mercato ha dimostrato la sua forza e solidit siamo soddisfatti del risultato di unestate al mare un esperimento riuscito che intendiamo ripetere anche in futuro

8635463 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8635464 it is available in beta version now but keep in mind that we are still carrying out quality checks and will be releasing the final complete version at a later date
8635465 we have got the skills and are now in a position to be able to translate firefox and other software into other indigenous languages
8635466 and we will do this because we want to contribute narrowing the so called digital divide
8635467 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8635468 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8635469 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8635470 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8635471 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8635472 after carefully assessing the situation the bureau of the organising committee for the fifa world cup today decided that the preliminary competition match between georgia and the republic of ireland will take place at a neutral venue due to the current unrest in georgia

8635476 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8635477 fans stop me a lot and ask me about the super bowl
8635478 thats the ultimate goal theres no denying that but its a journey were not going to win it today its a long hard road to get there
8635479 last year we talked a lot about the big picture but im not sure we understood it
8635480 now we understand lets not worry about december and january right now i think last year we got a taste of really what its going to take and now i think were out to get it but understand that it is a patient long process weve got to go play and take care of business
8635481 weve got to make sure we take care of right now
8635482 the only expectations we have are to play as good as we can
8635483 we know that if we do that well be in good shape thats the only expectation we put on ourselves its not to try to do what we did last year not to try to win a championship obviously thats our goal but you cant put those kinds of expectations on yourself because each year it gets harder
8635484 its just being a little bit more emotional and having a little bit more of an attitude when we step out on that field
8635485 and coming out with a little more fire and well be fine
8635486 when we were at our best and we played at the level we want to play at we did not give up big plays
8635487 if you give up big plays youre going to give up so many points thats what concerned me we played good offenses dallas is an outstanding offensive football team seattle is an outstanding offensive football team you get a better evaluation of where you are and what you need to do
8635488 they came to us as undrafted free agents spent some time on the practice squad and earned their way on to the 53 man roster by working extremely hard both have become productive players and were extremely excited to have them in the fold for years to come

8635496 our ice breaking research vessel polarstern is currently on a scientific mission in the arctic ocean departing from iceland the route has taken the ship through the northwest passage into the canadian basin where geophysical and geological studies will be carried out along profiles into the makarov basin to study the tectonic history and submarine geology of the central arctic ocean in addition oceanographic as well as biological studies will be carried out polarstern will circumnavigate the whole arctic ocean and exit through the northeast passage
8635497 the polar regions especially the arctic are very sensitive indicators of climate change the uns intergovernmental panel on climate change has shown that these regions are highly vulnerable to rising temperatures and predicted that the arctic would be virtually ice free in the summer months by 2070 other scientists claim it could become ice free as early as 2040 latest satellite observations suggest that the arctic could be mainly ice free even earlier
8635498 at awi we place particular emphasis on studying arctic sea ice and along with in situ studies of sea ice thickness change satellite data have been used extensively not only for the regular observation of changes in the arctic and antarctic but also for optimising the operation of polarstern in regions covered by sea ice

8635515 phalanx2 is installed us cert said in a note on its current activity site
8635516 this is a corporation with more than 5 billion in sales they made 200 million in profit last year so therefore theyre a company worth billions of dollars theyre clearly trying to protect themselves
8635517 i think for the chief executive to be on camera about it is the most effective way and probably the only thing that should be done in a situation like this
8635518 i think there may be a little hit but i think the recovery will be quite rapid i think the reassurance is there the fact that mccain took it off the market quickly mitigates any risk to consumers they should feel confident the stuff that caused the problem is gone
8635519 in order to avoid prejudicing themselves or to create problems for themselves later if there are legal proceedings theyre not saying very much
8635520 laughed at the suggestion and certainly did not call mccain on it

8635527 ours are kind of a flat line about 1 000 a month
8635528 occasionally it happens that you have a district that will be at odds with the national trend
8635529 it may be an anomaly but your local industry still depends on the energy sector and sectors tied with it and they have done reasonably well
8635530 its a bad sign that chapter 13s are down thats the bankruptcy where you have a plan to pay some money back over three or five years and chapter 7s are up thats where there is no such plan
8635531 weve seen distress in a lot of different industries and in particular in retail and home building
8635532 oil prices are so high and we have so much oil money that it insulates us
8635533 there have been a lot of complaints about rec procedures from researchers in recent years they often find the process onerous and bureaucratic however this study is the first time anyone has systematically analysed what recs are saying about cancer trial proposals
8635534 recs are looking for evidence that researchers are sensitive to ethical issues in particular to participants interests and that information given to potential participants explains the trial fully and truthfully researchers can improve their chances of success at ethical review by really good preparation
8635535 this is the largest investigation to date to compare fracture rates in hiv infected patients with those of non infected controls
8635536 this very large study group with more than 8 500 hiv infected patients and over two million controls has the power to detect significant differences in risk for both men and women at critical sites such as the hip and spine risks that increased with age
8635537 these data indicate that we should screen hiv infected patients both men and women for low bone density as they age
8635538 we also need to learn more about the mechanisms of this bone loss whether antiviral drugs the virus itself or other metabolic factors are responsible and investigate specific fracture rates for women before and after menopause
8635539 arsenic poisoning is behind many instances of ill health in southern asia including a rising number of cancer cases developing a low cost method of decontaminating ground water that is laced with high levels of arsenic is a key challenge for sustainable agriculture there
8635540 while there are some techniques available for treating relatively small quantities of water there has until now been no viable technology available for decontaminating groundwater on a large scale that can ensure safe irrigation and potable water supply
8635541 this project developed by queens is the only method which is eco friendly easy to use and deliverable to the rural community user at an affordable cost
8635542 from its inception we have had the vital support of indian based stakeholders such as village councils and local financial institutions this has been vital as they are the authorities who monitor the water supply and distribution in rural areas and provide micro credit to the local farmers
8635543 with their help we now have a solution which is transferable to many areas in need across asia
8635544 our binocular region is a kind of spotlight shining through the clutter allowing us to visually sweep out a cluttered region to recognize the objects beyond it
8635545 as long as the separation between our eyes is wider than the width of the objects causing clutter as is the case with our fingers or would be the case with the leaves in the forest then we can tend to see through it
8635546 non leafy surroundings or surroundings where the cluttering objects are bigger in size than the separation between the animals eyes
8635547 animals outside of leafy environments do not have to deal with clutter no matter how big or small they are so there is never any x ray advantage to forward facing eyes for them
8635548 because binocular vision does not help them see any better than monocular vision they are able to survey a much greater region with sideways facing eyes
8635549 this x ray vision makes it possible for animals with forward facing eyes to visually survey a much greater region around themselves than sideways facing eyes would allow
8635550 additionally the larger the animal in a cluttered environment the more forward facing its eyes will be to allow for the greatest x ray vision possible in order to aid in hunting running from predators and maneuvering through dense forest or jungle
8635551 in todays world humans have more in common visually with tiny mice in a forest than with a large animal in the jungle we arent faced with a great deal of small clutter and the things that do clutter our visual field cars and skyscrapers are much wider than the separation between our eyes so we cant use our x ray power to see through them
8635552 if we froze ourselves today and woke up a million years from now its possible that it might be difficult for us to look the new human population in the eyes because by then they might be facing sideways
8635553 steve wanted to do something with the sound and feel of his home city
8635554 nyc is where giants walked the streets the greatest musicians in the world could be heard on any given night james brown coltrane hendricks dylan sarah vaughn and on and on new york city is always in the rhythms
8635555 when i first started going to new york with steve he showed me a different side to the city he told me endless stories about the music that has come from there that he experienced about life growing up there and he also introduced me to old friends and musicians who know another city than the younger generation i know
8635556 everything we did when making the record from choosing the studio to the food we ate to mixing the sounds to the order of tracks was done with new york in mind
8635557 the artwork for the album is made from pictures taken during the recording

8635560 while we have shown that the new probe can work for two types of procedures we believe that results will be more far reaching
8635561 there are many catheter based interventional procedures where 3 d ultrasound guidance could be used including heart valve replacements and placement of coils in the brain to prevent stroke wherever a catheter can go the probe can go
8635562 while the images obtained this way are good some patients experience adverse reactions to the contrast agent
8635563 also the images gained this way are fleeting the 3 d ultrasound guidance does not use x ray radiation or contrast agents and the images are real time and continuous
8635564 these tiny transducers work together to create one large transducer working much like the compound eyes of insects
8635565 the human memory can be remarkably fragile and even inventive when it comes to remembering past events often completely rewriting autobiographical belief
8635566 no one has examined the possible effects of false memories on behaviour until now
8635567 we asked ourselves can false beliefs be sufficiently strong to alter behaviour if one develops false memories in the laboratory might they have an influence on ones short and long term attitudes and actions
8635568 with obesity levels reaching epidemic proportions around the world we could use this type of suggestive therapy for treating cases of obesity or influencing dieting choices

8635578 here in america and especially here tonight we need to remember two basic truths
8635579 society has an obligation and christians have a gospel duty to provide adequate and compassionate support for unwed and abandoned mothers women facing unintended pregnancies and women struggling with the aftermath of an abortion
8635580 heres the second truth killing an unborn child is never the right answer to a womans or societys problems acts of violence create a culture of violence and abortion is the most intimate form of violence there is it wounds the woman it kills the unborn child and it poisons the roots of justice and charity that bind us all into one human family

8635588 youve always whined about wanting to be one of those people who can wear stuff like this and sighed over the fact that you just cant incidentally simply by sliding this on your ass and zipping it up the back you are now someone wearing something like this and the world is somehow still spinning on its axis
8635589 it depends on the brief for how much coverage they want but some pr companies can charge around 700 a day
8635590 depending on how many days work you think it will take a job like this could cost around 25 000
8635591 i agree that we should concentrate on getting people into salford but i think the councils own pr team should concentrate on what they are supposed to be doing
8635592 it is the first i had heard of it and i would like to know how much this is costing the taxpayer
8635593 the council are supposed to be saving taxpayers money not spending it on external agencies
8635594 the council have employed people specifically to do this job to promote the city if they have to hire another firm to do this it begs the question that maybe our staff arent good enough
8635595 i dont think it is a waste of money because we will end up bringing extra resources into the city the tourism industry is worth a lot of money to the city and i think it is important that we embrace this
8635596 we may have lost the battle at celtic on saturday but i dont think that we will lose the war we play the crusaders again in the grand final eliminator in a couple of weeks and they will find us a much tougher proposition on that occasion
8635597 the advertiser described him as a little fighter and thats exactly what he is
8635598 frank was very ill but he battled back and when i went to see him he had a lot to say for himself
8635599 i started working on him when he was almost three weeks old had just been taken away from his mother and siblings due to his infection and was a tiny scrap
8635600 he would talk to me and spend ages climbing all over me at the start hed fit in my hand with my other hand gently on top of him delivering healing reiki energy
8635601 it was while i was thinking about my future that my own cat bella became a bit poorly
8635602 i knew for some reason that if i just put my hands on her it could make her better i did it and half an hour later she leapt away it had worked
8635603 id heard the word reiki before but i didnt know what it meant i did some research and before i knew it id enrolled at a reiki school
8635604 im not a religious person i dont follow any strict and unquestioning dogma
8635605 i might feel a fuzzy feeling in the palm of my hand when im treating an animal and the area which is being treated will begin to get warmer it feels lovely

8635611 our partnership with 3i has been crucial to the success of our business thanks to the experience and knowledge of 3i we have been able to develop from a promising growth business into an established player in the belgian renewable energy market we had anticipated we would need five years to achieve this but are pleased to have achieved our milestones within just two years electrawinds will now focus on its next stage of growth we thank 3i for their support

8635641 the decisions we have to make are some of the hardest in public life and nhs resources are not limitless
8635642 two of the manufacturers have developed proposals which may reduce the cost
8635643 i am sure that i will be able to keep most of the players that i want to keep as the players are in the same frame of mind as me disappointed with the season weve had but believing that we can improve as a group and really move forward next year
8635644 we had a very inexperienced squad this year and in my opinion i would be foolish to scrap it and start building again
8635645 there is familiarity with the players here and they now know what playing for swinton is all about
8635646 so we are going to use the keighley model they have shown faith in players and gradually built to go from easy beats to fourth in the league
8635647 but i will be releasing some players and i hope to be able to go public with the names of those players in the next week or so
8635648 and i will be looking to bring some new players in after the deadline has passed on monday
8635649 i have drawn up a wish list and i am confident of being able to strengthen the squad
8635650 we will also have some players back from injury next year
8635651 as for craig ashall and barry hamilton i am delighted that they have signed new contracts
8635652 craig has had a great season he did exceptionally well for us last season and hes actually improved on that this year
8635653 his attitude and will to win is second to none
8635654 barry has had a few injury problems this year but if he can steer clear of injuries next year i am sure we will see his full potential
8635655 he is my refuge and my fortress my god in whom i trust
8635656 i will rescue him i will protect him for he acknowledges my name
8635657 we thought we had david but hes told us that hes had a change of heart and we are disappointed
8635658 its better though that he has decided to stay now rather than to have come over and then tell us that he isnt happy

8635666 and has your solitude never weighed too heavily on you
8635667 oh i know very well i was made to be a priest i followed my vocation
8635668 come now m le cure tell me this tell me how it was you resolved to renounce forever all that makes the rest of us love life all that consoles and sustains us what is it that drove you impelled you to separate yourself from the great natural path of marriage and the family you are neither an enthusiast nor a fanatic neither a gloomy person nor a sad person was it some incident some sorrow that led you to take life vows
8635669 look here m le cure it is your turn now to make a confession
8635670 i was not made for ordinary life i saw it fortunately in time and i have had many proofs since that i made no mistake on the point
8635671 my parents who were mercers in verdiers and were quite well to do had great ambitions for me
8635672 i scarcely ever played i had no companions i passed my hours in homesickness i spent the whole night weeping in my bed
8635673 in this way i remained taciturn self absorbed without expansion without confidants
8635674 this was my case this faculty of regret developed in me to such an extent that my existence became a martyrdom
8635675 i did not speak about it i said nothing about it but gradually i became so sensitive that my soul resembled an open wound
8635676 as soon as my studies were finished they gave me six months time to choose a career a very simple occurrence showed me clearly all of a sudden the diseased condition of my mind made me understand the danger and determined me to flee from it
8635677 verdiers is a little town surrounded with plains and woods
8635678 now one evening after a long walk as i was making my way home with great strides so as not to be late i saw a dog trotting toward me he was a species of red spaniel very lean with long curly ears
8635679 when he was ten paces away from me he stopped
8635680 he gained courage gradually rose and placing his paws on my shoulders began to lick my face he followed me to the house
8635681 this was really the first being i had passionately loved because he returned my affection
8635682 i often stopped at the side of a ditch and sat down in the grass sam immediately rushed up lay down at my feet and lifted up my hand with his muzzle that i might caress him
8635683 one day toward the end of june as we were on the road from saint pierre de chavrol i saw the diligence from pavereau coming along
8635684 suddenly as the vehicle came close to me sam perhaps frightened by the noise and wishing to join me jumped in front of it
8635685 he died in a few minutes i cannot describe how much i felt and suffered i was confined to my room for a month
8635686 one night my father enraged at seeing me so affected by such a trifling occurrence exclaimed
8635687 how will it be when you have real griefs if you lose your wife or children
8635688 his words haunted me and i began to see my condition clearly
8635689 and if you only knew how in spite of this misery tortures me ravages me but what would formerly have been an intolerable affliction has become commiseration pity
8635690 these sorrows which cross my path at every moment i could not endure if they affected me directly i could not have seen one of my children die without dying myself and i have in spite of everything preserved such a mysterious overwhelming fear of events that the sight of the postman entering my house makes a shiver pass every day through my veins and yet i have nothing to be afraid of now
8635691 i was right i was not made for this world
8635692 for my part if i had not my grandchildren i believe i would not have the courage to live

8635709 but at the back of my mind were still thinking that this could change at any minute
8635710 the other children can be really protective but he just pushes them as if to say let me get there on my own

8635743 we are closely studying the guidelines and crystallizing taught on them we will take up the issue of investment ceiling with the regulator in a day or two
8635744 10 per cent of outstanding shares or 10 per cent of fund size which ever is lower can be invested in equity shares of investee company
8635745 given the size of our corpus it would be difficult to keep investment within the stipulated limit
8635746 we certainly hope that our suggestions would be considered by the regulator and investment ceiling norms are tweaked
8635747 we have enjoyed significant growth this year in our share of the managed paid search market particularly in the u s and the u k our ongoing investment in technology and our focus on providing value added services has enabled us to outpace our competitors

8635749 creating 3d maps and worlds can be extremely labor exhaustive and time consuming also the final result might not be all that exact or realistic a new means grown up by scientists at the health center of manchesters school of minicomputer science and dolby canada however might make capturing depth and textures for 3d surfaces as simple as shooting two big screen with a digital camera one with flash and one without first an image of a surface is captured without flash the problem is that the various rogets ii the new thesaurusmain entry new part of speech adjective definition not the same as what was previously known or done fresh colors of a surface also reflect light differently making it uphill to measure if the brightness dissimilitude is a service of depth or color by taking a second photo with flash however the veridical colors of all visible portions of the surface can be captured the two captured images fundamentally become a reflectance map albedo and a depth map height field

8635764 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8635765 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8635766 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8635767 we can now confirm that local authorities that wish to maintain red telephone boxes minus the telephone equipment for aesthetic or heritage reasons will able to do so
8635768 bt has lots of money they should allow people who want them to keep the phone for free
8635769 it would cost bt at least 500 to cart the phone boxes away to impose charges smacks of corporate greed
8635770 it is a big game for us for sure but the situation is clear a draw is not enough and we have to win
8635771 there is a new confidence in the camp that only winning games can bring and we aim to take that and the valuable momentum gained against west ham into this contest
8635772 i thought we played really well against the hammers i am sure the supporters could see the desire and the passion amongst the players
8635773 we wanted to win badly and the organisation was good and it will hopefully be the same today i see no reason why it should not be the case
8635774 in the last 20 years or more city have had little to cheer about in terms of europe and that is sad when you see the number of fans and the feelings for the team and the pride they have in it
8635775 the european record is not good enough and starting today we want to give the supporters more to cheer about when it comes to european performances
8635776 it is very important too for some of the players to get more experience of european competition so staying in the uefa cup as long as possible is beneficial in so many ways
8635777 playing against different teams and different styles and in different conditions and stadia can only help players become better
8635778 i played with bolton and chelsea in europe and all their players no matter how experienced or famous learned things from being in europe
8635779 midtjylland played well in the first game and we must give them credit but we will be different this time around
8635780 we didnt underestimate them we built well for the game and we knew how they would play but sometimes in life when you desperately want something to happen it doesnt and its the same in football
8635781 we were trying hard but nothing would seem to go right for us that is part of the game but now we must fix it we are only at half time and we must be patient and play to our strengths
8635782 we all know how important this game is to the club and to the supporters we dont want to go out at this early stage because we feel we are good enough to go a long way
8635783 the manager made it clear we werent good enough in the first leg or against villa in our opening game and we started to put that right against west ham but we can be even better
8635784 we have to find that same sort consistency week in and week out now everyone has been on a high since sunday and looking forward to this match in denmark
8635785 we have a lot of work to do to turn the tie around and it will be tough because they have shown they are a decent side but we absolutely feel we can go through
8635786 we are a good side going in the right direction and we will get even better
8635787 todays match in denmark is a big challenge for us but we are that much fitter now and have more of a competitive edge than we had at the time of the first game
8635788 i said at the time that we would be a different proposition in the second leg and that is what we aim to be i think we have benefited greatly from the two premier league games in between the uefa cup tie
8635789 we all feel that it is important that we have success in europe and we want to progress
8635790 we feel that we have the quality in the side to go right until the end of the competition we are set up to battle away on four fronts but we know that midtjylland have some quality in their side and will be no pushover on their own ground
8635791 they were very athletic and extremely well organised but i was bitterly disappointed because we allowed ourselves to be trapped in our own half we didnt move the ball quickly enough or cleverly enough
8635792 we didnt show enough creative sparks to unlock the door our last pass was misplaced too often and from their point of view it was a perfect evening
8635793 we never got to the level we needed to but since then we have played reasonably well but lost at villa and then showed much more determination desire and inventiveness in beating west ham
8635794 midtjylland deserved their win at our place when our ability to retain possession deserted us we have to be better than that and we will be
8635795 they will see a more dynamic city tonight and one that shows more personality on the pitch we will read the game much better than we did
8635796 nothing has changed in the respect that midtjylland are a big strong side and will be no walkover
8635797 were going take our hearts and determination to see if we can hopefully find this little baby alive and bring her home
8635798 a few days ago i was speaking to a group and one young lady asked me what do you think dr
8635799 i think my most emotional moment came the night of south dakota and montana i was thinking about all those times i was telling people be what you want to be when you grow up and hell i didnt believe it its a big moment and with these sorts of things you usually dont expect to see the day
8635800 i dont think it will draw out latent racism because of the characteristics that define barack obama he is not a traditional black out of the civil rights movement he is a combo of african american and white i think america is at a place today where it is ready to move knowing that with its population balance shifting it is no longer about dominance by any particular one race
8635801 i think after iowa for the first time a lot of black people said wow this could happen
8635802 the reality is obamas not alone theres a wave of african american leaders who just excite i see in my own city people in their 20s who are just incredible just like the foray of blacks into baseball yeah there was a jackie robinson but after him there were dozens of players who changed the game there are glass ceilings that will be shattered in statehouses and party leadership positions obamas been a game changer
8635803 i thought in 1984 when jesse jackson ran for president that in order for a african american person to become the president of the united states that person would first have to become vice president i dont think that now
8635804 what this does for so many people of so many people of different colors and strides and stripe and genders is that if barack obama can do it anybody in this country can do it
8635805 i think that while it doesnt mean weve gotten to heaven we are on our way as the old song goes we are on the highway to a racial justice or at least towards eliminating race as a factor for putting people in political office in high places
8635806 its been a spiritual experience for me personally and i think its a spiritual movement that has taken the whole country
8635807 selecting sen obama as president of the united states would exceed in its import and its impact what abraham lincoln did in 1863 when he signed the emancipation proclamation african americans to a man woman and child feel that way
8635808 i was born in 1954 and in 1954 we would not be having this conversation so the fact that we have come to a place in our society where there are enough people willing to endorse through their votes financial support and political capital a black male candidate is very significant in terms of how society has evolved
8635809 i think this would be something that civil rights leaders such as king would have hoped for but i dont believe they would have imagined it happening now so quickly so soon
8635810 i dont think anyone looks at barack obama and thinks that this guy is speaking for black americans theres a danger that white people will say that the fact that barack obama is president means any black person can be president without any further reform of the system thats a big fear that his success will be used to reduced sympathies for those who did not succeed
8635811 as we mature in the political process we are developing a whole cadre of a new type of politician who wants to appeal more broadly to an entire society theyve got to appeal across the board thats just a sign to me of the maturing of the african american politician in this country
8635812 in spite of the fact that i might disagree ideological or politically i think its helpful for my daughter my 8 year old daughter asked me during my second term when we were getting sworn in she asked me daddy do you have women congressmen so i think there is a psychological benefit it is good to see an african american nominee for major political party now its not going to shock us as much no more than to see the female reporter or black quarterback or black republican or the hispanic head coach
8635813 barack obama is like the first african americans who ran for mayors of major american cities hes an extraordinary candidate
8635814 his candidacy is a reflection of its a fruit of the civil rights movement but the civil rights movement doesnt own him we may co own him we are maybe shareholders in his success
8635815 im 76 years old and i have participated in one aspect of the struggle or another since i was a teenager in high school after i grew up i understood that this wasnt an effort that you accomplished in one lifetime or one great magic movement as we held in the 1950s and 1960s it was long range project you know that you have to keep pushing and you know that you have to keep struggling and you dont know exactly how it will come out but you believe the struggle is worth it because you know there is more decency in the country then the status quo has it well i never back in the 60s i never pushed with the idea that sometime in my lifetime a black person would get to be president of the united states it never occurred to me
8635816 barack obama has never been a black leader he is a leader that happens to be black he has never carried the black agenda the responsibility for african americans will be as if not more paramount to address these issues than before his campaign began
8635817 the country really has evolved and thats a wonderful thing who would have though four years ago that an african american man could be the nominee of the democratic party his nomination means it can happen and will happen likely in our lifetime

8635820 there is a possible drop in atf prices by 10 12 per cent which could translate to about rs 300 400 in fares but we will not immediately cut our fares
8635821 our basic fare structure will remain consistent in the next 45 days between september to october we are neither increasing our fares inspite of the fact that festive season is coming up

8635856 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition
8635857 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind
8635858 we are going to see much more dramatic drops in output
8635859 the way to get out of it is to act by interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus and other things to try help people who are hurt through this
8635860 sitting by doing nothing is not going to get us out of this and hoping that a knight in shining armour will come and lift us out of this is optimistic in the extreme
8635861 to sit and worry about inflation expectations and what is going to happen to those rather than worry about the fact that the economy is going to go into a recession seems to be misguided
8635862 what we have now is a turning point in many ways certainly you might think of it as a paradigm shift we have a global financial crisis an oil shock coming people with little experience of what is really going on
8635863 the question is whats going to happen in prices in 18 months down the road and the answer is inflation is going to plummet like a rock

8635897 if you ban cycle rickshaws it will create huge problems in the city in terms environmental pollution because they will be replaced by motorised vehicles that burn fossil fuel
8635898 it will create parking problems and also add to traffic accidents
8635899 these are people who are the poorest of the poor mainly coming from rural areas who are landless farmers uneducated and unskilled so they have no jobs
8635900 they come to the cities to ride rickshaws and earn about rs200 rm15 a day which can sustain their families

8635902 the uk is the first place we were warned about under dress shots weve been scared ever since
8635903 it bothers me because i didnt get into the industry for that
8635904 an aircraft at eglin afb would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a cia proprietary organization in the miami area at a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers all boarded under carefully prepared aliases the actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone
8635905 take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual
8635906 i got a message on that uh plane its a big truck with a mural painted of a of a airplane diving into new york city and exploding inaudible know whats in the truck the truck is in between
8635907 we got both suspects under kay we have the suspects who drive drove in the van and that exploded we have both of them under kay lets get some help over here
8635908 there arent a whole heck of a lot of bad guys there left to fight
8635909 our vehicles seemed to go largely unnoticed as there was much construction and rebuilding taking place
8635910 the requirement right now in iraq is much more about nation building than it is fighting
8635911 its our view that if theres a stiffer fight going on someplace else then thats where we need to be
8635912 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8635913 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8635914 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving

8635918 manchester city can exclusively reveal that shaun wright phillips has rejoined the club
8635919 the fans favourite agreed personal terms after completing a medical this morning thursday and joins on a four year contract following an undisclosed deal being reached with chelsea
8635920 obviously im delighted to come back to city and i just cant wait to get started again
8635921 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city
8635922 ive always admired him and hes certainly been a target of mine since i came to the football club
8635923 that germany is still in better shape than most other eurozone economies
8635924 the clock for the german labour market is literally ticking it is only a matter of time before the economic slowdown will be felt
8635925 we expect clearer traces of the economic slowdown to become visible later this year
8635926 was in line with the trend established over the past two years
8635927 to fall modestly further during the latter months of 2008 and possibly even in early 2009 despite the dampening influence from the slowdown in economic growth
8635928 there has been no excessive hiring in the current cycle

8635942 the health inequities we see in the world are absolutely dramatic in their scale
8635943 between countries we have life expectancy differences of more than 40 years a woman in botswana can expect to live 43 years in japan 86 years
8635944 one of the recommendations in the commissions report is that there should be universal health care systems that are available to people regardless of ability to pay
8635945 virtually all advanced countries have universal health care systems but we dont think that should be limited to high income countries we think that could be much more broadly available
8635946 we believe the rise in the number of c difficile cases recorded as a contributing factor on death certificates does not represent a rise in actual deaths but primarily an increase in awareness and reporting
8635947 the vast majority of these deaths could have been avoided if the government had only taken the right action at the right time

8636111 one of the wonderful things that people that attend the event understand is that they may check in with steamer trunks and they may wear vintage clothes all weekend long but ultimately this is an engagement of education

8636113 so comingling with tourists and others is meant to spark a dialogue
8636114 from the moment you check in until the time you leave its like taking a cruise
8636115 theres no reason to leave the ship for the whole weekend you are around people in vintage clothes and in the evening you can imagine being at sea with the music playing we really do try to give people the time machine experience

8636126 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is my wife glenys the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because all our predecessors were thick
8636127 i started thinking as i was coming over here why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family to ever go to college is it because our fathers and mothers were not bright
8636128 those people who could sing and play and recite and write poetry those people who could make wonderful beautiful things with their hands those people who could dream dreams see visions why didnt they get it was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground and then come up and play football weak
8636129 those same people who read poetry and wrote poetry and taught me how to sing verse is it because they didnt work hard my ancestors who worked in the coal mines of northeast pennsylvania and would come up after 12 hours and play football for four hours
8636130 so what if i didnt attribute it to kinnock i cant quite understand this if i was making up who i was then thats one thing

8636233 most of red steels faults lie with the games presentation enemies shout annoying obscenities in your direction during every firefight the cheesy score is bad enough to incite chuckles and the jaggy graphics look worse than many xbox and playstation 2 games
8636234 the citys sections felt too similar to each other i admit i dont have all the answers on making a perfect open world racing title but carbon falls short in this area dont worry though the speed in this game is enough to outrun such criticisms
8636235 theres certainly a lot here to love and a lot more that you want to love but most of your time in kane amp lynch is spent shaking or scratching your head the problems are just too visible for it to be taken seriously as a gritty thriller

8636257 we are working hard to iron out glitches before it goes out to users this is not about security issues
8636258 instead of delaying the launch of the database this intrusive project must be scrapped altogether
8636259 a recent independent review has already undermined all of the governments assurances that the database will be secure the discovery of further technical issues does not bode well for the future the government has proven itself untrustworthy with large databases containing sensitive data parents have every right to demand that their childrens personal details are not put at risk
8636260 may allow a situation where an abuser could be able to access contactpoint for illegitimate purposes with limited fear of any repercussions
8636261 the enormous size of the database and the huge number of probable users inevitably increase the risks of accidental or inadvertent breaches of security and of deliberate misuse of the data which would be likely to bring the whole scheme into disrepute
8636262 this looks like further evidence of the chaos at the heart of government we repeatedly warned the government of the problems with contactpoint but they pressed ahead regardless ignoring our calls to allow time to sort them out
8636263 there were clear indications in february of significant security concerns with this database only now with just weeks to go until the project is supposed to go live have they finally agreed to pull back to try to iron out some of the problems ministers now need to come clean and confirm whether this delay is because childrens personal information is at risk
8636264 you are going to get zealots the very people for whom zanjeer zani has always been a hotbed using the practice to make a political point we are concerned that they may say this is mans law and gods law is higher but this is not gods law and like the concept of jihad is misunderstood by some it is not a religious edict but a state of mind
8636265 the authorities should have been educating the community we fear a small percentage will make children do the zanjeer zani in defiance i believe islamaphobia has coloured this case and this will make the shia community think about where they stand in the community
8636266 we dont condone anyone under the age of 16 doing it but we do believe that after the age of 12 a boy can start making his own decisions and if a teenager is built like a brick outhouse and wants to do it you cant stop them doing it
8636267 some of the people do it so hard the skin flays off their breast but the police have never stopped them children who do the zanjeer zani have been doing the matam since they were little babies if mr zaidi goes to jail we may see copycats who want to go to jail to highlight the issue
8636268 this sort of practice has been going on throughout the islamic world for centuries and although there have been cases like this in the past they havent been brought to court
8636269 because of this case this practice has now been highlighted and this law is now being brought to the attention of the community before our community didnt know about the law
8636270 the community and community leaders are now working together with the cps and the police to bring about a code of practice to benefit everyone
8636271 we cannot eliminate this practice but we can and will work to a code of practice so that the children dont get hurt the law isnt broken and the people who do want to take part dont get prosecuted
8636272 we have to take into account peoples beliefs and their rights and we will respect them but we are not above the law and we never will be and working with the authorities is the best chance weve got to prevent any harm being brought against any children
8636273 the best way of achieving our aims now is to try and understand the law better and work within the law to move forward
8636274 this case doesnt set a precedent this case was decided on its own facts but what the case does show is that any practice which exposes children to harm will be subject of a crown prosecution service decision
8636275 the cps and prosecuting counsel andrew nuttall have always been at pains so say that this isnt an attack on shia practices the crux of the issue is the victims age and the prosecution was brought on the basis that an adult cant cause a child to be harmed or expose a child to harm under british law

8636446 since the rod laver arena rally the association with the assistance of its delegates has met extensively with members and has heeded the memberships call for action on resources

8636457 for a child to take panadol at the school they need the parents permission so i cant understand why the school nurse can take your child to the doctor to get her put on the pill
8636458 i feel its broken down the relationships between the parents and their children
8636459 having said that i was surprised at the case and it would be incumbent on the school to advise the parents that course of action had been taken
8636460 i dont know all of the circumstances of the case every case is different im sure the school and the school nurse has acted with the best interest of the child at heart
8636461 but the child is only 14 there should have been consultation with the family

8636539 the cars are parked there in an effort to deter crime in that area if a criminal enters a parking lot and sees a patrol car parked here he or she does not know if a deputy is in the vicinity or if the car is a decoy he or she may think twice before stealing something or robbing someone unmanned patrol vehicles may be placed at intersections or along stretches of road that the sheriffs office receives frequent complaints about red light running or speeding for example for many drivers just the presence of a patrol vehicle makes them stop at red lights and drive the speed limit

8636671 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8636672 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8636673 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8636674 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8636675 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8636683 khalid abdullah tariq al mansour of san antonio a black lawyer and orthodox islamic lecturer
8636684 i was introduced to him by a friend who was raising money for him and the friends name was dr khalid al mansour from texas he is the principle adviser to one of the worlds richest men he told me about obama he wrote to me about him and his introduction was there is a young man that has applied to harvard and i know that you have a few friends left there becasue you used to go up there to speak would you please write a letter in support of him i wrote a letter in support of him to my friends at harvard saying ot them i thought there was a genius that was going to be available and i sure hoped they would treat him kindly
8636685 if there is someone who wore fate on his sleeve it is barack obama
8636686 you could see it happen you could feel it it was a matter of time
8636687 a leader that god has blesses us with at this time
8636688 barry was given a lesson that he would consume over and over his unique racial ancestry made him someone who certainly was not to be ostracized or shunned
8636689 in my case you had this person who was almost a myth in our family about how smart he was and how well he had done school and how well spoken he was
8636690 so that was something to live up to high expectations on the other hand heres somebody who wasnt there and that i would come to learn was an alcoholic someone who had not treated his family well and so that was something you felt you had to make up for
8636691 and even in times of self doubt obama has hearkened back to that wisdom
8636692 very much at the root of who barack has become
8636693 he realized people began to respond to him in a powerful way
8636694 he had this ability immediately you sit there and say this guy there is something special about him
8636695 no matter who met him or how you met him you walked away with that impression this guy is going places i think he will be president of the united states did i think he would become more than what he was at the time yeah he had this unique ability to make people feel comfortable around themselves and feel part of the process
8636696 if all goes well maybe he will be president of the united states
8636697 i also thought he likes people and people liked him i thought early on this was someone who could unify the country across political lines there was something about his lack of dogmatism and his problem solving ability and the ability to connect with him
8636698 so we were in the midst of one of our intensive discussions about civic engagement
8636699 and after one of these ranging discussions across the political sectors he did this tour de force summary
8636700 its true i give a good speech what can i do nothing wrong with that
8636701 who i am willing to sacrifice because we have this window of opportunity
8636702 be one of the most dynamic leaders we have seen in a long time
8636703 the thing i want to remind you is that everybody in this party knows that
8636704 you know why i say that because see before he was running right after that wonderful speech at the convention everybody wanted a piece of hope it wasnt naive then barack spent the entire fall traveling around campaigning and raising money for every single democratic race
8636705 we expect russia to live up to its international commitments reconsider this irresponsible decision and follow the approach set out in the six point ceasefire agreement
8636706 in accordance with that remain in force abkhazia and south ossetia are within the internationally recognized borders of georgia and they must remain so
8636707 i can assure you that these are purely humanitarian aid shipments that are going into
8636708 since the united states is a permanent member of the u n security council this simply will be dead on arrival in the
8636709 continues not to honor the commitments that the russians have signed onto
8636710 it is not in russias interest to have a nuclear armed nation on its border on the

8636740 developments in the charlottesville albemarle charlalbemarle area that are attempting to reverse this new trend of keeping kids so close to home but what is needed is more than greenspaces
8636741 play is the primary mechanism through which children engage and connect with the world and natural environments are particularly attractive inspiring and satisfying for kids something magical occurs when children and wild spaces mix
8636742 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8636743 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8636744 its been a fast and furious year with the furniture row team and the good news is that weve come a long way
8636745 we still have a ways to go but for a single car team competing with the mulitcar big dogs were holding our own and showing improvement
8636746 the record is important to everyone on this team because it shows improvement and thats what youre always looking for in this business
8636747 california and michigan are probably the two toughest places on engines
8636748 the race is 500 miles so it creates a challenge for the engine builders you have to get your car handling good but the power of the car is very important and you have to weigh in the reliability factor when we run our engines on the reliability dyno michigan is where we run it which is very similar to california
8636749 its not a track with a tremendous amount of grip
8636750 california has a lot more grip in the spring because its cooler
8636751 now that its hotter its a good bet that the tracks going to be slick on race day which is good thats why the groove will widen out and thats why guys can move around on the race track the way they can
8636752 this new car has less downforce than the other car so handling is even more important
8636753 every team is trying something and this is one of our latest pieces to try to get the car to turn a little better without being so loose off the corners
8636754 if your car is driving well one that keeps you up toward the front all day because its fast then just two tires can keep you pretty quick
8636755 in that situation you could make a big gain at the end by just taking on two tires and maintaining your track position even some guys who are behind and dont have their car the way they want by taking on two tires the track position they gain helps out more than four tires would

8636759 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
8636760 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914 when because of one terrorist leading world powers clashed
8636761 i hope georgian president mikheil saakashvili will not go down in history as a new gavrilo princip
8636762 what we may be witnessing is not just the end of the cold war or the passing of a particular period of post war history but the end of history as such that is the end point of mankinds ideological evolution and the universalization of western liberal democracy as the final form of human government
8636763 many people blame the georgian president they are wrong in part but there is also an element of truth to it he cant be accused of having acted illegally it was legal to move our forces into the south ossetian capital tskhinvali but it would have been better not to
8636764 on one side you have a bear and on the other a little roquet
8636765 but when youre a chief of state you have to know about the reality of forces this was an incredible misjudgment by saakashvili
8636766 signed decrees on the recognition by the russian federation of the independence of south ossetia and the independence of abkhazia
8636767 may have wider implications for security and stability in the caucasus
8636768 through our policy of neighborliness the european union must do all we can to support georgia and ukraine
8636769 we find this unacceptable it only adds to the difficulty of solving the conflict in south ossetia and abkhazia
8636770 we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia
8636771 we reject this categorically and reaffirm georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
8636772 has now chosen this route means they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community in general
8636773 this is not an easy choice but this is the only chance to save peoples lives
8636774 the heightened activity of nato ships in the black sea perplexes us
8636775 only yesterday i saw there were nine nato ships in the sea and by evening another frigate of the us navy passed through the bosphorus strait we have also learned that another eight warships from nato states are expected shortly
8636776 historically troubled economic times in the united states have helped generate long overdue public policy reforms
8636777 we have now entered troubled economic times likely our worst since executive pay started ballooning in the 1980s ballooning executive pay has helped create our current economic woes deflating that excess can help end them
8636778 china has expressed concern over the latest developments of the situation in south ossetia and abkhazia we understand the complicated history and reality of south ossetia and abkhazia issue in the meantime in light of our consistent principle and position on issues alike we hope to see relevant parties resolve the issue properly through dialogue and consultation
8636779 the russian side has stressed the need for tbilisi to carry out point four of the medvedev sarkozy plan under which all georgian troops should be returned to their original bases
8636780 medvedev and sarkozy also discussed additional agreements which may in future ensure safety in the areas near the borders of south ossetia and abkhazia
8636781 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in caucasus we regret about russias excessive use of military force in georgia and about its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8636782 how would you assess ria novosti reports regarding the support of hamas and hesbola terrorist organizations are going to offer russia in recognizing independence of abkhazia and south ossetia
8636783 according the the facts of russian agrression against georgia occupation of georgias territories and total ethnic cleansing on those territories it will be no exaggeration to say that russian federation has gained followers it is worthy of we are left with no other option but to congratulate moscow on this gain
8636784 this little tidbit of info mation is that age of conan sucks its not the gigli of the mmo industry thank god but thats only because ben affleck turned down his role for voiceovers for king conan no im likening age of conan to be more of the alexander of the mmo industry huge expectations huge budget huge letdown gracious cleavage

8636937 however there will be short term downward pressure on our profit as the market share of wireline subscribers will continue to shrink in the near term while our forthcoming mobile services operation will need significant investment
8636938 were the best and we dont have to listen to these guys
8636939 no wonder no one shoots rapid fire its too damn hard
8636940 our gunmakers are capable of making a seriously competitive gun they choose not to do so

8636948 health in sri lanka for example is considerably better than it is in russia despite considerably higher incomes in russia than in sri lanka
8636949 were asking the help of the icmp to help us identify the body of the victim i believe they have better advanced facilities and theyre better experienced in handling such cases
8636950 maybe we could send them bone samples for identification since most of the tissue samples that were earlier tested were already contaminated
8636951 we hope that through this we will be able to finally confirm or negate the identity of the victim
8636952 has his work cut out for him if he expects to find a sympathetic ear in denver
8636953 we are almost certainly one u s supreme court justice away from roe being consigned to the dustbin of history
8636954 were imbued with 14th amendment rights to life liberty and property
8636955 deluding themselves if they think roe is eternal no matter who wins the white house
8636956 if mccain is president he promises to grant human rights to microscopic cells and he very well may succeed
8636957 it comes to explaining this position and defending this record
8636958 equally likely that the discussion itself will only highlight how absolutist the party remains
8636959 abortion is back with dare we say it biblical vengeance
8636960 being pulled back down to earth by the force of his own vagueness
8636961 obamas current problem isnt really about his position on abortion it is about his central weakness as a presidential candidate he overthinks and ends up seeming not to know what he thinks
8636962 will be viewed as spineless or insecure or both none of which inspires confidence
8636963 no other domestic issue comes close to rivaling it in importance
8636964 pro life movement is on the verge of achieving the unthinkable repealing roe v wade
8636965 now is the time for the forces of civilization to take their stand

8636967 good thing ust called the timeout because we had no more timeouts left
8636968 we were able to draw up that play for l a revilla during that timeout
8636969 its good everybody stepped up for the team even without coach franz
8636970 we believe that this method of accurately measuring acid in the air passages may represent a significant step forward for improved more accurate treatment as it confirms acid reflux ar is occurring in a patient
8636971 the result of our study is the ryan composite score for pharyngeal acid exposure that provides a scale for severity of pharyngeal reflux to assist physicians in making a positive confirmation of the diagnosis
8636972 with the sims we were basically selling expansion packs to the same customers over and over
8636973 i think spore lends itself more to horizontal expansion where we take components of the game like levels or editors into totally different formats and hit people that maybe never even played the hardcore pc game but would enjoy a lighter experience using one of the editors or using the content in new ways outside of spore the game
8636974 my great great grandfather invented tennis strings in 1875 and babolat has been a leader in the production of strings ever since
8636975 we continue to innovate in this area so that we can provide tennis players all over the world with the best products to improve their game our new addiction string continues that tradition by providing the best power comfort and durability at a great price
8636976 we are so pleased to have k3 as the official ball sponsor of the little mo regionals and nationals we are very impressed with the quality of this new tennis ball and the professionalism of k3 tennis also the kids love to keep the k3 ball as a souvenir since the little mo logo is imprinted on it putting a logo on the tennis ball is an extra special touch that k3 tennis provides
8636977 da h tte noch sehr viel mehr passieren k nnen
8636978 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
8636979 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
8636980 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
8636981 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
8636982 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world
8636983 iran doesnt pose a serious threat to us the way the way the soviet union did
8636984 john mccain is distorting barack obamas words to cover up for the fact that its the failed bush mccain approach to foreign policy and the bush mccain war in iraq that that have strengthened iran and endangered israel while barack obama recognizes that iran has been the biggest beneficiary of the war in iraq and that the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same if john mccain was serious about dealing with the threat from iran he would join barack obamas bipartisan effort in the senate to step up sanctions on iran instead of adopting the same tired old bush rove playbook
8636985 because democrats so divided this country that iran saw weakness
8636986 the bush mccain fear of tough diplomacy has allowed iran to spin 3800 centrifuges threaten israel and fund terrorism john mccain promises more of the same

8637005 where we are headed can be broken down to the challenges facing the world and queensland and the trends that have already begun
8637006 will the gold coast be australias venice this is a possibility
8637007 we know the water level is going to rise so people with inland houses may own beachfront property by then
8637008 there will be a transition from coal to solar and wind energy which some experts believe will be the cheapest assuming a global carbon emission regime is in place
8637009 there will be very little need for one as our ties become stronger with china and india which have already began to become asian powers
8637010 there will be a strong local community and if trends continue we might see the phasing out of local representatives altogether
8637011 there is every indication that a new form of direct democracy comes in where everyone would all get an sms asking them to vote yes or no for a law everyone votes and the law is made
8637012 the trend is heading away from the nuclear family so well see a lot more single denser living arrangements with greener rooftops and lots of robotics
8637013 but by then we wont mind because well be able to step into virtual worlds
8637014 well be able to transport from our dingy unit to a sunlit beach in the blink of an eye
8637015 if we begin to build highrises and highways wherever we want then brisbane will just become another los angeles
8637016 crime will go up social equality will go down and all the things that make queensland special will disappear
8637017 at the moment we are seeing trends that mean we will most likely live to be 100 years of age so lets continue it
8637018 where we are headed can be broken down to the challenges facing the world and queensland and the trends that have already begun
8637019 people dont get fed properly people get sleep deprived the staff get frustrated as well it leads to a whole snowball effect
8637020 i can give you three instances of elderly people falling out of trolleys because they were confused they should never have been on trolleys in the emergency department
8637021 its one of the things that unfortunately if you leave an emergency department overcrowded elderly patients unfortunately will fall and its a risk president chris davis a geriatrician said the situation was concerning
8637022 elderly patients are very often disorientated even before they get into hospital
8637023 to leave an older person on a hospital trolley or in a wheelchair in an emergency department is completely unacceptable
8637024 increasing the amount of time that patients spend in an emergency department leads to deaths
8637025 the number of long stay patients in queensland emergency departments has skyrocketed in the last couple of months
8637026 increasingly were setting up elective surgery centres that dont buckle under the pressure of increasing emergency demand so we can separate the two
8637027 the entire health system in queensland is in danger of collapse
8637028 it is not a problem that is going to go away quickly
8637029 it is a symptom of the problem in the whole system
8637030 we are looking at the option of a medi hotel
8637031 multiple medical issues including seasonal illness have put rockhampton hospital under pressure but it is not in crisis
8637032 staff are working hard to ensure a safe level of service is maintained
8637033 but more and more young people are hopping between work and study in their post school years more easily
8637034 there is going to be a much more flexible marketplace for education
8637035 pathways to higher education are critical to meeting the states social and economic aims
8637036 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8637037 in that context the decision to outsource to an australian hospital with the capacity to perform that surgery within the next three months makes sense
8637038 while we are capable of meeting current demand there is a backlog of high priority patients
8637039 the way id like to die is at a big grand buffet being eaten by 13 women after being injected with morphine and lots of other crazy things
8637040 anchored by j robert lennons prose poem of the same name in which the author exposes the history and lingering psychic life of abused broken and discarded objects
8637041 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business
8637042 long haul capacity for winter 2008 09 will decline by 11 per cent year on year compared to previous plans to grow by 1 percent and short haul capacity in the same period will decline by 1 percent compared to a previous expectation of 2 per cent growth
8637043 im comfortable here this is probably the longest ive been with any team this year it feels good theyre letting me throw at the beginning of the year i wasnt starting and when i was i was just coming off being a reliever so i wasnt ready to go deep into games getting a chance to start here i had a couple short outings to get going and since then ive been able to go longer since i dont strike guys out and i pitch to contact that only helps me
8637044 weve faced that hitter before and i know he likes to pull the ball through the hole between third and short i was just shading him over toward the hole a little bit and he hit a hard ground ball i was able to get to it and i know hes not the fastest guy so i took my time and got it over
8637045 the fact that our pitchers throw strikes helps your mentality on defense it makes the game a little more fun out there i definitely enjoy it as long as im able to make the plays
8637046 no matter the outcome we continue to believe lucentis is the most appropriate treatment for wet amd
8637047 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8637048 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8637049 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8637050 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8637051 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes
8637052 our resources would be better spent looking at other diseases where there are no treatments
8637053 by fact that they didnt support the clinical study leads me to conclude that in reality there is no difference between the two drugs
8637054 i see this as a public health study not only for us but for the whole world it gives everyone the license to use both drugs interchangeably
8637055 clearly for medicare it would make economic sense to put preference on the use of avastin
8637056 it would surprise me if the contractors did not quickly use that concept

8637059 the guard walked up to reich and said what the fuck do you think youre filming
8637060 we already know he is a rock star we already know he can bring 85 000 people together in a stadium he has done it multiple times he needs to talk to people who havent made up their minds yet
8637061 its likely that the campaign would do it differently if it had to do it again because the decision was made before the european trip
8637062 but if this is what it takes this is what it takes cause its wrong and people are dying
8637063 the recall has been very large but in fact its entirely possible that only a small portion of the meat that was recalled was actually contaminated
8637064 im quite concerned because i am a walking time bomb
8637065 if we see that again in 2008 i think that would a really strong indication that a difference really has been made among this 20 to 24 year old age group

8637067 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8637068 and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition and senator st augustine said at three months we dont know
8637069 while catholic teaching is clear that life begins at conception many catholics do not ascribe to that view
8637070 the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition of when life begins
8637071 why do i have to go to bed now mom
8637072 all my catholic friends get to go to bed at 8 30
8637073 smoking bottled water drilling for oil in the arctic owning a handgun and coveting john edwards neighbours wife will remain on the list of prohibited activities for ardent and practicing catholics
8637074 theyve jumped from generation one to generation four or five it just looks better and feels better
8637075 were as close to an approval as one can get without having it

8637077 i think the timing for zimbabwes participation in the fta is wrong given the quantum of problems facing the country we might have a situation where other countries benefit at our expense we may be used as a dumping ground
8637078 the only way out for us zimbabwe is to put our house in order politically and economically so that we can compete at the same level with other sadc states
8637079 today we can say with pride that our collective efforts have borne fruits and that we have successfully met the objective we set ourselves
8637080 indeed it required hard work dedication resolve and an unswerving commitment to mobilise our limited resources so as to meet our objective
8637081 we cannot move ahead with the question of having a single monetary system where we have our currency aligned
8637082 the only challenge is that our companies have to gear themselves up to produce quality products at reasonable unit costs
8637083 our biggest challenge is that we have to repair our relationship with the international community because we cannot go it alone
8637084 we must stop insulting the world and create a genuine democracy and respect property rights
8637085 required a lot of compromise to be made on a number of sensitive issues
8637086 we need to recognise that regional economic integration is not only about the removal of tariff barriers

8637094 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8637095 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8637096 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8637097 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8637098 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8637099 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8637100 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8637119 the fact that despite deals being inked all over town not a single virgin comics film or tv production has actually been made and the boffo news that bransons partner in the venture is deepak chopras son gotham as in gotham city home of the batman which likely explains the commonly cited reason for the comics lines failure that it focuses on stories involving relatively obscure indian mythology

8637127 tell wgn that by providing kurtz with airtime they are legitimizing baseless attacks from a smear merchant and lowering the standards of political discourse
8637128 it is absolutely unacceptable that wgn would give a slimy character assassin like kurtz time for his divisive destructive ranting on our public airwaves at the very least they should offer sane honest rebuttal to every one of kurtzs lies
8637129 a concert of this nature is not conducive to teach the younger generation to become good citizens upright and competitive but instead would weaken them morally and mentally

8637137 we cant support all the needs of the consumer and there are great companies providing services on the pc already so were very open to provide the opportunity to those companies to reach our user base as well
8637138 we like to provide as many services as possible for free we already provide our network access for gameplay for free and the interesting thing about the network side and the internet business is that theres a variety of revenue sources
8637139 those are things were looking at and learning how we can provide a service without people having to pay but we still get our operation running with funding from somewhere so that we can maintain the level of quality we want

8637151 when i first came up with the idea for music catch my intent was for people to be able to play with their own music in the game
8637152 unfortunately due to some limitations it wasnt something that we could do with the online game so when we started talking about doing a downloadable version it was the one feature that i was sure needed to be included
8637153 when working on our new game we decided to mix three popular casual game genres and give a classic game play a new look with innovative twists explosive bonuses spectacular visual effects and fascinating storyline we believe all that made 4 elements very attractive
8637154 based on the initial reviews we received from our partners and customers we expect the game to show outstanding results both online and in physical retail where by the way we are still looking to explore new markets in europe and asia
8637155 we really had a great time making kingdom elemental but when we finished i really wanted to add more
8637156 with this update we took the time to add all the features we could not add in the original release

8637162 as we face difficult budget times at both state and local levels of government this bill has the potential to help protect us from cuts to important city services such as public safety
8637163 and as a long beach resident im all for that
8637164 its a very good thing for long beach and a very good thing for the state
8637165 youll start seeing some revenue right away but it wont be that much
8637166 these are not revenues we are going to realize overnight this is a long term investment it is something that proved effective 1992 with arco and were hoping will be this time around
8637167 the oil field is in need of investment in order to maintain current oil production levels as well as potentially increase production and revenues on a long term basis
8637168 i thought something had blown up down at the port
8637169 it was also the cars i dont know what kind of cars they were using but you could hear muscle cars the helicopter was going all night
8637170 its hard for me to say that they shouldnt do it
8637171 if its gonna be nighttime filming with excessive noise then the people that would be affected should be given a chance to give their opinion
8637172 that seems to be what were dealing with right now
8637173 management or owners get it but dont disseminate the information
8637174 it is true that the picturesque nature of the rainbow harbor and marina areas have brought the city much exposure and positive business through filming of special projects however these projects should not be a burden upon the residents nearby
8637175 such disturbances of your quality of life and the sacrifice of your basic needs for sleep and quiet are of the utmost concern to me
8637176 when people come to visit from out of town theyre kind of excited about it
8637177 i am not an unemployable seat warmer that needs a public sector salary i will only stay as long if there is meaningful reform to be undertaken but i wont be standing for the next election
8637178 this was brought about by reckless vandalism by the opposition
8637179 despite barry ofarrells economic vandalism we cannot stand still and let the state suffer we must do whats necessary to secure nsw future electricity supplies
8637180 we would urge the liberal party to reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8637181 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8637182 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery
8637183 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period
8637184 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8637185 its time that we started to concentrate on the 80 per cent of folks out there that dont do anything wrong and really start to meet their needs
8637186 id like to be in a position to say that within so many hours or days of a crime being committed against you you get a chance to talk to a detective if its a crime that needs to be followed up by a detective
8637187 it may well be more a matter of the follow up after youve reported it that within so many days well get back to you well tell you whats happening with it
8637188 thats the really important stuff thats what the community is telling us is the big issue what happens after the event
8637189 you knew that your career was in danger you hoped that if you performed the procedure then the sexual act would not be disclosed by the patient
8637190 they asked him questions in relation to various aspects of school life whether father spillane may have been suspected of interfering with boys he couldnt put his finger on any specific incident in light of a complaint being made now he thinks there is room for concern
8637191 he was a teacher who was employed by the school he had been convicted of an offence and police saw he was someone they could talk to about this
8637192 he has been guaranteed by police he is not a subject of any investigation he has led a very exemplary lifestyle since then he hasnt worked with children he fully acknowledges what he did was wrong
8637193 any sort of bullying whether it be in the playground or over a computer is not acceptable and we take these matters very seriously
8637194 victims of bullying should not suffer in silence i urge all victims to tell your teachers tell your parents or to contact police
8637195 when you compare to other cities sydney has just built nothing
8637196 this study shows that the state government has been asleep at the wheel since the 1920s in terms of public transport
8637197 that means that areas of high density in the middle ring suburbs arent adequately serviced by the infrastructure
8637198 we havent built any significant public transport since the 1920s
8637199 since the harbour bridge was opened in 1932 weve completed the circular quay line in the 1950s and finished the east hills and eastern suburbs lines the airport link was one of the bigger jobs but look at it it is only four stations
8637200 the comparisons clearly show there has been an underinvestment in public transport in the sydney city centre compared with other global cities
8637201 we had a few police officers on the 19 man trek one was taking photos of the trees when he discovered what looks like the remains of a body
8637202 it wasnt until the wind blew strongly that you could really see it is in a harness there are goggles and it appears to be caught up in cables so presumably it was an airman or member of the air crew
8637203 im open to it i may have to do that just based on what we did against carolina its not a matter of throwing them back out on the field or putting on pads and scrimmaging for two hours its a matter of developing a drive and getting back some tempo before the regular season a 10 day layoff without getting them out there for a drive against jacksonville may not be the right thing
8637204 if we had waited even one more work the tumor could have reached her brain and her prognosis would not have been good
8637205 thats an excellent point about the 4th amendment ms poe and im assuming you have case law to support your position
8637206 so what if what my dog loves to do most is lick his empty nutsac

8637209 other than john darer no one seems to be doing anything
8637210 thank you for being the inspiration that you are and for being a strong advocate for integrity in our business
8637211 i commend you on your effort to make a difference
8637212 he is a fabulous writer who has a great passion for the structured settlement industry i commend him on the passion he invokes when he writes on his blog listed above that type of commitment and passion is hard to find and is rare in this world
8637213 i love your weblog keep me on your e mail list
8637214 well done john that is an outstanding piece of work
8637215 i just read your blog about bair vs darer great stuff
8637216 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8637217 hes a former marine and great guy and hes older than i am so that might work
8637218 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8637219 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8637220 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8637221 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8637222 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8637223 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8637224 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8637225 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8637226 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8637227 ive heard so many great things about tel aviv and israel but hearing is one thing and experiencing it for yourself is another we are planning to have a great time and a great evening
8637228 unfortunately the state of israel cancelled your performance in the country due to lack of budget and because several politicians in the knesset had believed at the time that your performance might corrupt the minds of the israeli youth
8637229 a great missed opportunity to prevent people like you who shaped the minds of the generation to come to israel and perform
8637230 has been experiencing some discomfort in the past couple of days
8637231 the launch was specially tasked to test the missiles capability to avoid ground based detection systems
8637232 as part of the commander in chiefs order there will be a few more launches of this particular missile before the end of the year
8637233 recycling is one solution but its just a small part of the puzzle
8637234 weve heard poverty talked about more in this campaign than we have in the past by both parties
8637235 you have a situation where most people in the country dont see themselves as poor or disadvantaged so if youre pitching your message to them solely youve got a problem
8637236 wage stagnation is colliding with the increasing cost of basic goods
8637237 we understand the complex history and realities of south ossetia and abkhazia
8637238 reflecting chinas consistent stance on such issues we hope all the parties can appropriately resolve the issue through dialogue and consultation
8637239 it cant influence georgia and it cant influence russian policy on georgia thats beyond our scope
8637240 this is a fight china doesnt want to be in the middle of they really wish russia would pull its head in a bit
8637241 beijing doesnt want a russian chinese convergence here that appears threatening to the west
8637242 india is facing its own share of separatist rebellions so it cant be seen as opening its mouth too much
8637243 but if you talk about effective control you can make a direct analogy with taiwan
8637244 georgian people are strong spiritually and physically and no enemy can break them down let us ask god to deliver us from seen and unseen enemies and turn them all into friends
8637245 today we have a great crisis in georgia a big war is starting i think our patriarch told us to pray every day
8637246 we should be asking god every day to give us back abkhazia and samachablo
8637247 abkhazia and samachablo are and will be indivisible parts of georgia
8637248 today the whole of georgia prays to saint mary that she saves georgia from wars from damages from the devil
8637249 the freezing of the mehdi army is considered valid until further notice and anyone who violates this order will not be considered part of the mehdi army
8637250 the first friday of ramadan every year will be devoted to rejecting and condemning the occupation by peaceful means
8637251 after friday prayers we will go out we will reject we will condemn the american occupation
8637252 for the russians to say they are not responsible for what happened in georgia is ludicrous russia is to blame for this crisis and the world is responding to what russia has done
8637253 the presidents reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of respect for historic and cultural traditions of every country and efforts aimed at preserving the unity of a state and its territorial integrity
8637254 placing the emphasis exclusively on the use of force has no prospects and hinders a comprehensive settlement of local conflicts
8637255 serious signal for those who are trying to justify the aggression

8637262 a lot of uighurs are going to pay a price for these attacks this is a vicious circle because people are then further disenfranchised and radicalised and chinese services in turn are more repressive because of separatist sentiment
8637263 people of various ethnic groups coexist in harmony and equality and the situation in xinjiang is generally good
8637264 this has nothing to do with any alleged persecution or oppression of the uighur people

8637272 we have had up to three times the average rainfall this month
8637273 so the ponds that dried out in early summer killing the fish and other invertebrates will have been drenched in august flushing away the salt water to make the ponds much fresher
8637274 this will have created ideal conditions for the re emergence of species such as the tadpole shrimp like it did in 2004

8637278 tim works on the back projections for the tv show
8637279 ive been trying to get a book of boosh stuff together for a long while
8637280 but its been a combination of having the time to dedicate to it and getting a publisher interested in letting us do what we wanted to do that means weve been able to do it this year we didnt want to produce a run of the mill piece of shit comedy book like you see in the shops we needed a publisher to invest in it the way we wanted were all very creative people noel pretty much draws everything from character costume designs to some of the stranger characters faces ive got over ten years of photography of boosh exploits from day one

8637285 cemex no reconoci nuestra potestad para establecer nuestra propia industria en el pa s lo que para nosotros es inaceptable
8637286 cemex ha tenido una actitud completamente distinta algunas empresas transnacionales se han equivocado con lo que es nuestro pa s tenemos como experiencia las petroleras que algunas creen que est n por encima del poder del estado
8637287 lo que han hecho es extraer del pa s nuestros recursos vaciar nuestras minas de la materia prima para tener una estrategia y negocio global que no necesariamente tiene que ver con nuestra estrategia nacional
8637288 si los privados tienen inversiones eso hay que reconoc rselos es lo que establece nuestra ley cuando utiliza el t rmino de justiprecio para las expropiaciones eso es lo que llamamos un acuerdo razonable
8637289 tenemos que actuar ajustados a nuestras leyes y en lo que est vigente ahora en la ley de expropiaci n

8637293 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8637294 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8637295 before the discipline of ea got the visibility it has now
8637296 the ilog acquisition goes a long way in rounding out ibms bpm enabled by soa
8637297 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8637298 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8637299 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8637300 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8637301 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8637302 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8637303 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8637331 the house with the boy with the green shirt is down there apparently there were about 13 boys just now down there and some neighbors heard them say that they just jumped someone on 46th street and said we need to call the police
8637332 i said enough is enough but didnt know what to do and so we had two other ladies that lived down the street from me and sent out a flyer saying if youre tired of this come to this meeting so thats how it started
8637333 we just slowly started branching out figuring the more area we cover the more we can push them out of the way
8637334 you kind of have a very tight house mentality you know where you kind of close windows and things
8637335 i mean we had to push a little and say before the neighborhood becomes a bad neighborhood you should work on helping it become stable
8637336 recently we caught four guys breaking into the family dollar on 79th amp burleigh
8637337 first one was a rock baseball size second one was a small brandy bottle
8637338 came through there on bikes and threatened my children they were outside playing in front of our house
8637339 she is a soldier in the neighborhood she sits out on her porch every day and she watches and as soon as she sees something she calls the police she calls me she calls the other neighbor and so they kind of disperse whenever they see her outside and go somewhere else
8637340 you make it sound as though we havent made any progress
8637341 we have weve made a lot of progress but every time we take a step forward with some of the neighbors were taking two steps back and for the most part i hold a lot of the parents at fault
8637342 there must have been 15 people there earlier kids young kids nobody older than 16 years old but theyre looking out for other people to jump
8637343 but see like i said they dont come out when they see her out here and so she sits out here and watches our neighborhood
8637344 i couldnt leave i couldnt leave em and but you know the police need to step up a little more to the plate though too i mean these kids are making fun of em
8637345 there are so many nice restaurants in the area so we thought what a great idea if we make this a dog friendly place where people can sit and relax for a bit and have their dogs with them and not tie them up or leave them at home
8637346 im the kind of person who likes to bring my dogs with me as often as i can we heard that from other people all the time too
8637347 i said your dog can hang out with us and you can go grab a bite to eat you can go shopping and your dog can come in and relax in the store and have a few treats and be safe
8637348 its a long time past due that these laws be revisited

8637368 we met at a banquet we got to talking and she really understands the game
8637369 i told her id make a deal with her that if we won the gold medal id give it to her she thought i was kidding but i told her i had one already and the way they treated us at the wynn it was the least i could do

8637375 the diocese has invoked the provision that returns control of the parishes to the diocese an action that was approved by the diocesan council
8637376 declared that they had voluntarily left the ordained ministry of the anglican church of canada and had come under the jurisdiction of a bishop reporting to the argentina based anglican church of the southern cone
8637377 no communications have been received from st matthias and st luke since its priest left the anglican church of canada
8637378 attempts to appeal those rulings in both cases have been unsuccessful and costs have been awarded to the dioceses involved
8637379 the other project you are referring to gay pride march is in no way connected to the eurovision song contest and i do not see any possibilities for us to get involved
8637380 we are just now again starting the huge task of organising the biggest tv entertainment shows in europe any other event not connected to the eurovision song contest must take care of their own business
8637381 we are as every year discussing possible security circumstances with the host broadcaster and the authorities in each host country and among many other things we also demand a security guarantee for the delegations journalists and fans that will arrive to our event
8637382 we are also used to the fact that other parties commercially interests etc are trying to connect their own purposes with the eurovison song contest in order to get coverage and promotion in the media

8637388 k n subba does not even live in these two houses
8637389 he has disappeared a long time back his brother in law however is living in one of the houses and we have asked him to leave taking with him only his personal belongings he had asked us to offer him three days times to leave the house we have given him 96 hours
8637390 no this is not the party forcing these people to leave but the people themselves the people want these scrupulous leaders to pay for what they had done in the 21 years of misrule we have worked democratically and asked them to leave without destroying the house however in the event of their failing to leave the house within 96 hours could lead to things which gjm or its subsequent wings will not be responsible of
8637391 once they have left the houses we will open our offices there

8637400 for a recession the economy is certainly growing very quickly
8637401 a lot of that growth is driven off exports and pessimists might say that cant continue during slowing growth overseas but i would say this happened precisely during the period of slowing growth overseas this is still an economy that faces slow times but not a recession
8637402 a lot of the monthly indicators are suggesting recession but things like new orders and gdp suggest the economy is improving
8637403 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do tonight
8637404 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8637405 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8637406 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8637407 his life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8637408 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward a more perfect union of our founders dreams

8637413 the fears that i have expressed over the last six months have started to come to fruition
8637414 ive obviously voted on quite a number of occasions now for small cuts but we need to act and we probably need to act in larger amounts than that we need to actually get ahead of the game and it appears that we are now behind

8637434 when i arrived in estonia last week a former soviet republic that lies just south of finland everyone had an opinion on barack obamas speech in berlin
8637435 its a principle of the law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime

8637443 contactless has become an essential technology for new and expanding campus card programs
8637444 we have more than 100 schools using or in the process of migrating to iclass
8637445 our smartcity system is a full campus card system providing many applications on a single contactless card
8637446 our college and university clients are requesting that we enable contactless technology in not only new installations but retrofit existing installs as well
8637447 interest in contactless technology has steadily increased amongst our client base with new inquiries coming in frequently a meaningful percentage of cbord customers have already implemented the technology
8637448 constantly gathering feedback from our clients on new technologies they would like us to offer many of the contactless solutions we offer currently were the result of university requests
8637449 blackboard is committed to delivering solutions to fit the needs of our clients
8637450 a simple and easy to handle application of the technology for the user
8637451 the user doesnt even have to take the smart card out of his wallet
8637452 driven by the advantages of convenience as well as performance
8637453 with less direct contact to a card there is an inherent longevity that may be enjoyed for the card itself
8637454 we made a conscious decision to use our current system after much research and even visiting campuses across the u s to see their particular systems
8637455 a new installation is of course a big investment but customers roi calculations prove that the investment is protected
8637456 activities of this scale require an investment of time and careful planning
8637457 phased approach which helps them from becoming overwhelmed by the tasks and enable them to support existing applications while upgrading one or two applications at a time
8637458 i guess its just a way to express your individuality everybodys doing it

8637462 your site has ads for some nasty spyware according to mcafee
8637463 when we tested this site we found links to antispyware com which our analysis found to be suspicious
8637464 in our tests we found downloads on this site that some people consider adware spyware or other potentially unwanted programs
8637465 on f52a1 zip if youre chinese and youre looking for a way to access independent internet news sources try freegate the dit program written to help chinese citizens circumvent web site blocking outside of china
8637466 linked to red sites when we tested this site we found links to antispyware com which our analysis found to be suspicious
8637467 i have so many links and hundreds if not thousands of comment posts include them as well so its quite possible theres a link to this sinful site somewhere on p2pnet but only god knows where it is
8637468 we realize that some of these links are advertising but we think running advertising from many red sites is also an appropriate basis to classify a site as red similarly we believe that consumers should not need to be experts in which downloads bundle spyware or adware based on all these facts we stand by our current rating of p2pnet
8637469 another site that offers other content in addition to its malware so novices will be inclined to rate the site as good
8637470 however if you educate yourselves enough to know that people who pay for webhosting by hosting ads with malicious content are not legitimate news sources this site should remain red those reviewing it as green should have their future advice ignored

8637474 i can see it now air force one decked out with 22s and spinners maybe even a set of hydraulics watching the hip hop president in the oval office with his baseball cap on backward coping a gansta lean in the big chair should be really pimp dont you think

8637480 madame secretary i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the further conduct of the roll call vote all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and that i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8637481 all in favor of the motion to suspend the rules and nominate by acclamation barack obama as the democratic partys presidential candidate please say aye all those opposed please say no two thirds of the delegates having voted in the affirmative the motion is adopted
8637482 and in the senate john has voted with president bush 95 percent and that is very hard to believe and when john mccain proposes 200 billion in new taxes for corporate america 1 billion alone for the largest companies in the nation but no none no relief for 100 million american families thats not change thats more of the same
8637483 barack obama is ready to honor the oath to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8637484 the mccain bush republicans have been wrong again and again and again and they know they will lose on the issues so the candidate who once campaigned on the promise of a campaign of ideas not insults now has nothing left but personal attacks how insulting to suggest that those who question the mission question the troops how pathetic to suggest that those who question a failed policy doubt america itself how desperate to tell the son of a single mother who chose community service over money and privilege that he doesn t put america first
8637485 there is a written agreement it was a us proposal for the date which is 2015 and an iraqi one which is 2010 then we agreed to make it 2011 iraq has the right if necessary to extend the presence of these troops

8637503 we found in our research that crickets were five to six times more efficient in providing nutrients than beef cattle
8637504 each female cricket produces about 500 young crickets so you can see how efficient that is

8637528 lets declare together in one voice that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8637529 but i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country for example john thinks that during the bush years weve made great economic progress i think its been abysmal

8637531 last night hillary said shed do everything she can to elect barack obama
8637532 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8637533 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8637534 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8637535 hes done just what the country needed just what the party needed just what the people needed
8637536 we conclude that fannie should get through this difficult housing cycle with core capital remaining at or above the 15 excess capital requirement which implies they dont need any more externally raised capital
8637537 in the event that conditions worsen beyond our forecast the regulator could lower the excess requirement further such that the minimum requirement again becomes the binding constraint

8637542 we believe the risks are more than factored into dells current stock price and the companys market share and profit momentum are being underestimated by investors
8637543 well advertised push into the retail channel appears to us to have proceeded well driving worldwide pc unit market share up
8637544 while we have a more favorable view on dells revenue outlook for the second half of 2008 we remain concerned that dell remains aggressive on pricing as the company attempts to penetrate major channel distributors and manage the companys spiraling number of product skus
8637545 pricing remains a wildcard given dells burgeoning retail business and the strong growth of lower cost notebooks
8637546 the seasonally weaker first half has been marked by extremely difficult market conditions in the form of unprecedented fuel costs slowing economic growth in our main markets and a weakness in dollar and sterling

8637552 jewish dominated intellectual movements were a critical factor necessary condition for the triumph of the intellectual left in late twentieth century western societies

8637566 mit gro em stolz gebe ich bekannt dass barack obama der kandidat der demokraten f r die pr sidentschaft der vereinigten staaten ist

8637568 es hat 1992 nicht funktioniert weil wir auf der richtigen seite der geschichte waren und es funktioniert 2008 nicht weil barack obama auf der richtigen seite der geschichte steht

8637575 all truly wise thoughts have been thought already thousands of times but to make them truly ours we must think them over again honestly till they take root in our personal experience

8637579 volunteers spent one week on a diet high in dairy based calcium milk cheese and yogurt the next week they ate a diet low in dairy and calcium both diets contained exactly the same amount of calories and fat
8637580 the answer is if you have a high calcium diet you could double your fat excretion
8637581 you can actually get rid of twice as much of that fat if you have calcium adequate amounts of calcium at least a gram in your diet what happens is the calcium meets up with the fat and it forms a soap that soap gets pushed through your bowel
8637582 youll have poop that actually floats in there which reflects the fact that youve been able to excrete fat and not reabsorb it through your intestinal tract
8637583 usually we recommend folks take about 1 200 milligrams of calcium and somewhere between 600 and 800 milligrams of magnesium
8637584 the combination actually allows you to be loose enough to go to the bathroom
8637585 if somebody had a crime that the president had committed that would be a different story

8637593 have you any tips or suggestions for taking oil and grease stains out of a granite worktop much appreciated thank you
8637594 country roads take me home to the place i belong
8637595 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8637596 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8637597 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8637598 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8637599 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8637600 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8637601 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8637602 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8637603 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need
8637604 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8637605 normally each row is packed with fans about two or three per seat
8637606 the language is extremely vulgar and ive seen at a few games bottles being thrown at people or the field
8637607 i dont care if i dont get her numba cuz once i get my money rite she gon come runnin
8637608 well thats so true isnt it smack addicted aids infested bohemians do have a song in heart that should be heard shouldnt it the woes of gentrification and gay love really do sound great when put to a tango back beat dont they well i think so quick lets get in line for rush tickets
8637609 we are praying to the river goddess and offering her blood since only she can help us
8637610 we have the army disaster management teams police and other groups of rescuers making every effort to save the population
8637611 great ideas makes me want to drop my deadlines and jump into creating a minibook
8637612 the projects are beautiful inspiring and unique definitely a good investment if you love mini books or want to get new ideas
8637613 i unhesitatingly recommend this ebook as an addition to your scrapbooking reference library i know that i will turn to this ebook again and again for minibook inspiration gift ideas and the creation of heirloom items
8637614 i was blown away with the creativity and what the book had to offer at such a low price
8637615 i really liked your ebook all the projects show their own uniqueness and various levels of difficulty
8637616 to think this isnt a recession would be foolish but by the time the pronouncement comes it will be too late to strategically do anything about it
8637617 there are many questions profound ones at that which will take time to answer and then so late be of little avail
8637618 finance is a forward looking business never patient enough to tidy up yesterdays messes
8637619 the whirlwind crescendo of bad news seems never ending but the lower this market goes the more attractive it becomes for fundamental based investors who have a longer term horizon
8637620 if that is tough but still only rhetoric we could see the market rally i dont think anyone would care if there is harsh language used what investors will hope not to see is a move toward sanctions or restrictions against russia
8637621 when you see the developments in abkhazia and south ossetia you start thinking whats next not only georgia has problems with russia
8637622 my sense now is that investors are talking about timing and catalysts for coming back in
8637623 the general view is that we are really close to the bottom
8637624 under these circumstances we dont want any tension but at the same time russia is a solid economy russia is a powerful economy russia is a trusted economy
8637625 more tax breaks would be indisputably linked to the major part of the market have an immediate bottom line impact and draw some people in
8637626 the fundamentals are very good its a question of appetite
8637627 its like looking at a table of food its all very attractive but nobody wants to eat it
8637628 the treadmill is still going a little faster than hope now can keep up with
8637629 there are probably 10 million folks underwater owing more on their mortgages than their homes are worth and thats going to climb not everybody under water is going to foreclose if youre close to solvency these efforts can help pull you back from the brink but if youre well underwater youre probably going to drown
8637630 of the 192 034 total workouts completed by hope now in july nearly 112 000 or 58 were repayment plans while the remaining 80 000 or 42 of the workouts involved permanently modifying the terms of a loan to make it more affordable last year at this time less than 24 of workouts were modifications of the nearly 92 000 subprime loans that were fixed 52 of them were modifications
8637631 were already seeing prices at 40 60 off pretty much everywhere
8637632 they get hit by cars they run into power lines they get shot they eat things they shouldnt eat that have poison on them one of the compelling factors is that most of those things have something to do with us
8637633 perhaps we will make changes in our lives to better protect the birds
8637634 i was just so fascinated by the book and i really wanted to come
8637635 i met leona right after she won the x factor we were recording in the same studio in the states and we got to hang out
8637636 it was cool because we both understood what the other one was going through and so shared a bond im really proud and happy for her even though bleeding love kept no air off the no 1 spot back home
8637637 i havent seen her for a couple of months but maybe we could do something together one day there are a lot of people id love to work with and shed be one
8637638 but then i weighed out the options if something wasnt wrong then no real harm was done if something was wrong i really had no option so obviously i had to tell her
8637639 id seen a news article here in the u k a few years ago something similar and it just sparked a memory of that also the word cancer sprang to mind with the same memory so obviously i was quite concerned and just decided to do more research
8637640 grateful cannot even begin to describe how we feel toward maddie
8637641 do i consider madeleine our hero most certainly if she hadnt sent that e mail rowans prognosis wouldnt be as good as it is
8637642 i suppose if thats how they feel then thats what i am to them
8637643 i think anybody in my situation would have done the same thing if they had known what i knew and had the opportunity to say it
8637644 i suppose im a hero in a certain sense but in another sense i think im rather normal and i care about people
8637645 it usually happens in infancy or early childhood and doctors precisely look in a babys eye with that light looking for a certain kind of reflection when that reflection is abnormal it raises the risk of whether this type of tumor is there
8637646 that white reflection you see in the babys eye is sometimes picked up just on routine photography in this case a web picture but what you hope is that doctors will see it internally before it gets to this stage
8637647 sometimes its there but its so faint it really appears later its hard to put blame somehow it was missed with our increasing number of premature babies there are other problems that could also sort of look like it
8637648 so it is a reminder for parents to ask doctors when you go for the baby checkup is everything ok
8637649 if something looks like this in a picture or your babys eyes arent moving together or one eye is bigger than another just pick up the phone and say somethings not right
8637650 sources close to the mccain campaign have indicated that lieberman an independent democrat is very much in the running

8637653 those are questions for the mccain campaign and i think they are going to make their announcement shortly

8637659 yeah very much but i didnt care about the things he said to me it was more that he disrespected my team by pointing into the dugout he can curse me out and say whatever he wants i dont care but when he disrespects my teammates i need to stand up for my teammates i dont appreciate that

8637679 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighboring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq
8637680 the requirement right now in iraq is much more about nation building than it is fighting and quite frankly young marines join our corps to go fight for their country
8637681 its our view that if theres a stiffer fight going on someplace else then thats where we need to be

8637689 the matter was settled at a major meeting of mccains advisers
8637690 we are targeting another 58 people to be on the front lines
8637691 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subject to over a long period of time by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8637692 it is to do with the continuation of that treatment into the very important job i was doing as the co ordinator of the security and safety of the 2012 olympics
8637693 finally it is to do with the victimisation i have suffered since my grievances leaked to the media
8637694 im content with my achievements so far im not seeking massive monetary benefits and i do not have grievances against the whole of the met an organisation that i dearly love and admire
8637695 racism both institutional and individual still continues within the met
8637696 in fact it has not improved that much since the macpherson report
8637697 cheaper and slightly modified ipod touches players and new ipod nanos and related service announcements are expected to take center stage

8637700 in part because of a lack of adequate community based mental health crisis services
8637701 the creation of this mobile crisis team for davie forsyth and stokes counties is part of the initiative of providing such coverage within 30 miles or 30 minutes of every resident in the state
8637702 it was recognition by the general assembly that it is a tremendous assessment gap in the state tote said
8637703 but even with the expansion of the mobile crisis teams we will continue to struggle with lacking enough resources to meet the entire need the center that forsyth is planning is a step in the right direction as well

8637715 we have a system that is broken and it has been broken for a long while
8637716 thats what social workers said to me when i came into post you have to change this
8637717 it is a fact that at the moment we are not completely fulfilling our statutory responsibility
8637718 its not fair for the 178 children who are in care not to have an allocated social worker it is a piece of nonsense
8637719 there is broad consensus that the current arrangements in relation to childrens social work services need to change
8637720 referrals are increasing markedly there is difficulty meeting some statutory responsibilities and insufficient focus on preventative services for children and families
8637721 there is need for a radical review of how resources are used and how the service is organised
8637722 its imperative that every child in our care does have a social worker and it is a grave concern to me that they dont im not entirely convinced that this reorganisation is going to help that
8637723 we should be asking for more money instead of stretching the budget as far as it can go

8637741 more than 200 000 u s public school students were punished by beatings during the 2006 2007 school year
8637742 the other kids were watching and laughing it made me want to fight them when you get a paddling and you see everyone laugh at you it make you mad and you want to do something about it
8637743 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
8637744 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected

8637764 this shift in production means the skill requirements for manufacturing employees will continue to rise and firms will increasingly compete for skilled workers with other sectors of the economy
8637765 at present the manufacturing sector needs to do more to take full advantage of its current workforce through training and learning programs and do more to successfully recruit younger workers
8637766 there is no doubt that some segments are facing structural challenges
8637767 some segments of manufacturing have garnered gains in employment over the course of this decade the story is even rosier when one looks at production where nine of the 21 industries have experienced rising production over the course of this decade and total production is down only slightly what is surprising about the sector is not that it has struggled in recent years but that it has fared so well under these circumstances

8637770 going green is a must for companies to stay in business
8637771 while the stigma of green initiatives is that they are costly and uneconomical that is simply no longer true
8637772 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas

8637774 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8637775 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8637776 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8637777 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8637778 my fellow democrats america can do better than that and barack obama will do better than that
8637779 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8637780 a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need

8637785 our client now faces the prospect of prosecution and imprisonment thousands of miles away from his family in a country in which he has never set foot
8637786 our clients case highlights a worrying trend where uk citizens are at the mercy of the ever increasing tendency of overseas prosecutors to extend their jurisdiction to crimes allegedly committed in this country
8637787 intentional and calculated to influence and affect the us government by intimidation and coercion
8637788 ive lost two jobs because of this my bosses just didnt want to be associated with the publicity
8637789 gary mckinnon is neither a terrorist nor a terrorist sympathiser his case could have been properly dealt with by our own prosecuting authorities instead we believe that the british government declined to prosecute him to enable the us government to make an example of him
8637790 american officials involved in this case have stated that they want to see him fry the consequences he faces if extradited are both disproportionate and intolerable and we will be making an immediate application to the european court to prevent his removal

8637843 there were several situations this year that demanded steely nerves from print traffic one example is when we had to juggle three different prints of jindabyne between australia telluride nyc and edinburgh over a saturday and sunday to ensure delivery of a non subtitled print in time for our tuesday 09 00 show another tricky situation involved re exporting a print of zidane to a rural location in iceland under enormous time pressure three days before our own screenings we then had to move another print inward from paris by hand carriage the day before our screening under all the heightened security of the recent airport scares situations like these require a level head

8637885 town hall leaders to extend muslim fasting rules on non muslim politicians
8637886 town hall bid to extend ramadan fast to non muslims fuels row
8637887 the liberal democrats have enormous respect for the contribution of all faith groups and cultures to the life of the community
8637888 but we fervently believe that the rules of any one religion should not be imposed upon others
8637889 it is requested that members do not partake of any refreshments until after the iftar refreshments are served
8637890 we object to the request that non muslim councillors observe the fasting rules for ramadan
8637891 this sends out the wrong message to our community our community consists of a huge number of different religions all of which should be valued and no one religion should be accorded more status or influence than others
8637892 freedom of belief is an important human right and we liberal democrat councillors muslim and non muslim agree that this request is inappropriate
8637893 will not enhance community cohesion and asking for their reassurance that no faith is given any particular status or priority in the operation or decisions of the council
8637894 there is absolutely no suggestion that during ramadan non muslim councillors have been asked to refrain from eating or drinking when muslims are observing the fast
8637895 as normal water will be provided at council meetings taking place during ramadan
8637896 tea coffee iftar packs and non iftar snacks will be available in a separate room for all councillors

8637932 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8637933 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8637934 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8637935 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8637936 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8637937 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8637938 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8638018 the information i see on the internet is astounding im finding out about great masters and seeing tapes and videos on youtube that i didnt know existed and these tapes are revealing a lot to me even at this stage i dont know where this stuff came from but there must have been some fan who happened to have an old 16mm film camera or the film stock and has converted it its nothing i could have imagined i saw myself from the university of washington in 1970 on youtube and i have no idea of who took that film
8638019 it took 20 years to get enough information to become an apprentice to your teacher in india
8638020 the teaching took place when you inspired your teacher to come out of his room and tell you what to do while you were practicing
8638021 its difficult because the way of life is different here in north america the way to learn an art form in america is to pay and learn in india you dont pay a guru with money you pay him in service kindness respect honor and love in return you will learn from him and he adopts you like a son he cares for you feeds you and educates you hes more than a parent
8638022 in the future the guru student relationship may not be possible
8638023 whats happening is that it used to take 20 years just to become an apprentice then you finally become a performer down the ladder and you worked your way up but nowadays the same knowledge that an apprentice would have achieved in 20 years is available to you at your fingertips
8638024 im all right with that but once youve got all of that information there has to be someone who can help you sift through it and analyze it it needs to be chiseled and chopped to get to the information thats valid for you for that you need somebody but what has happened is now the teachers work is already half done because the information is there
8638025 so these young punks when theyre playing at the age of 18 have twice or thrice as much information in their heads as i did when i was 18
8638026 there is so much thats readily available in the days of my youth if you found a recording of a great master it was like discovering the tomb of king tut all through the student community the tape would circulate and wed be talking about it like people do on the internet now but today everybody has access to this information without having to coax it out of the guru when i talk to somebody and say did you hear that 1962 recording of a great master they say yeah i have it i downloaded it bang so yeah i feel a hundred years from now the information will definitely be there in existence what my hope and what i pray is that there will be someone able to help those people who have that information and hed be able to help them sift through it
8638027 i learned from my father from the age of two until i was 11
8638028 every night hed wake me up at 3 30 in the morning and the teaching would last until 6 30 in the morning then id go to school that was the routine it wasnt drumming it was only talking about drumming and where it came from wed talk about the importance and sacredness of the knowledge then i put it into practice by playing the tabla once i came home from school
8638029 i was introduced to a philosophy and a way of life that is not possible to get only from a computer it energized me and it made me who i am
8638030 such training is rare if not nonexistent now you see in the physical sense this possibility is dying out even in india but all of the musicians who are performing with me take it upon themselves to take a few students with them when they travel to do daily learning sessions when they are at home they come for lessons every day they dont live with them like they did before but they are still allowed to be with them through the day drink tea with them eat with them and talk music with them so that process is still there
8638031 the musicians of today continue to feel that this approach is important
8638032 whats interesting is that these musicians today still dont take money from the students the knowledge is available but you have to inspire the teacher the teacher is like a river of knowledge its up to the student whether they have a little cup or a big bucket its always been the feeling in india that a guru doesnt teach the student inspires the lessons so if you have that talent as a student and you show that spark you will get what is necessary for you from your teacher
8638033 when i teach in california there are no fees involved
8638034 they come and they hang out we do six hours of drumming a day for many days and then they go home its my obligation and duty this knowledge that is still vague in their memory its up to us to help them understand it
8638035 the challenges are in the way of life because thats where you understand what the music is about
8638036 i went to brazil and i hung out in the village of airto moreira the shaman thats when it was revealed to me what being a shaman is all about i learned about the tradition and the repertoire as well as the importance of it and the sacredness of it so the challenge is being in that environment living that life if you can do that consistently i think it makes you a person to whom the way to respect what exists in the world is revealed this is what has worked for me and it was gratifying to see these players from other traditions who have been through similar rigors and challenges
8638037 that never happened im still waiting for that but it was always what i grew up with when i finally gained the focus of being in control of my memory when i could go back and remember everything the first thing i can remember is music i was already doing it before i was conscious of doing it then i remember the joy of it the big grin on the face when im doing it not just when i was doing it but when i was watching my dad playing id be sitting and looking at everyone and i would have this wow look at whats happening expression on my face the joy has always been there and that hasnt dimmed i watched my dad play tabla when he was 75 and here was this old man climbing up on the stage and playing suddenly the years dropped off of him suddenly it was like he was in his favorite playpen with his favorite toy
8638038 i remember talking to myself and wishing that when i was 50 that i would have the same love and passion for what im doing that my dad did then
8638039 now that im way over 50 i feel i love it just as much i cant wait to play and once im playing i want to keep on going ive seen tabla players with shaky clawed hands at 80 years of age and then they get on stage and do an hour of full power boom what happens i have no clue i hope i get there myself
8638040 some people may just need help getting back into the community
8638041 this is for people not quite ready for a nursing home
8638042 we dont want this to be an institution we want this to be a home

8638044 if heat is provided as a service included in the rent it cannot be interrupted and must be available through the tenancy
8638045 for any kind of sport now when you get to a certain level it takes a lot of financial support to keep it going
8638046 but we could at least help them with the boats and help them to keep their clubs in good condition that would be a help

8638095 i use method cleaning products from target for my day to day maintenance cleaning since its supposed to be non toxic and better for the environment i applaud the guys who started the company for their success in bringing green cleaning products at affordable prices to the masses they even encourage less waste by selling bulk refills for their spray bottle products since ive used their stuff for a couple of years i know theyve also experimented a lot with their packaging design thats gotta be pricey when it comes to experimenting with different bottles thats why i was a little surprised that this two bottle system wasnt designed better the goal is to decant liquid from the larger bottle into the spray bottle the problem is that you either need a funnel or a steady hand to carefully pour from the wide spout into the narrow one on the spray bottle inevitably some of the liquid will probably spill if you opt for the latter method no pun intended in all cases the bottleneck man they just keep coming is the smaller of the two one idea is to stick something like a dish soap spout on top of the larger bottle this would probably be the cheapest option since its not a custom spout the downside would be the rate at which it would dispense the replacement liquid another idea would be to use a bottle with a spout that is just slightly narrower than that of the spray bottle my third idea would be some sort of retractable pouring funneling mechanism built into the cap of the larger bottle something like those pour cups built into the caps of liquid detergent except it would flip over and screw on reversibly and allow liquid to pass through maybe this is over complicating the matter and everybody else has a clean funnel even though i dont

8638099 music and politics go hand in hand and you can not have a political campaign without music
8638100 our songs have been used over the years during political campaigns and there is nothing wrong with that in fact they can contract people to even compose for them but in doing these duties the musician should know how to handle such issues

8638206 i myself would not anticipate sanctions being imposed while the meeting has not yet taken place
8638207 if certain nations are considering sanctions frances position as head of the european union is to obtain a common position for the entire european union
8638208 theres an expectation from the baltic states that the president in brussels will present a common stance of the three baltic states and poland
8638209 it is not only a threat to international security but a breach of it
8638210 the territory previously known in soviet times as south ossetia is completely cleansed of remnants of the georgian population

8638212 i myself would not anticipate sanctions being imposed while the meeting has not yet taken place

8638214 it is not only a threat to international security but a breach of it

8638218 this deployment is routine in nature and has been planned for over a year notification of the requirement to transit the turkish straits was given in june well before the current georgia crisis and is completely unrelated
8638219 as everyone knows the un and its specialised agencies are organisations made up of the governments of sovereign nations
8638220 there is only one china in the world and taiwan is part of china
8638221 we are taking a more pragmatic approach this year by seeking to join the 16 agencies under the un instead of the top body itself
8638222 we think this bid is more acceptable and we hope china can show goodwill amid improving ties so that taiwan can participate in un activities in health humanitarian and other areas
8638223 i cant send you a bill until i receive the payment
8638224 yes they work well and yes they probably cover 80 percent of the image editing most non photographers do but if youre already familiar with photoshop its just as easy if not easier to switch to that application than to deal with a new set of tools in xpress
8638225 thats assuming you already bought and use photoshop i can think of two reasons why quarks approach makes sense economics and creativity economics imagine a production shop with dozens of seats of quarkxpress its possible that you wouldnt have to buy dozens of copies of photoshop for those users creativity those users can perform their image work directly within quarkxpress and see the results immediately within the context of the layout page you cant do that in indesign even if you pay for the entire creative suite and also pay to upgrade it every 18 months

8638228 our business users are using safari to deliver jasperreports to them on their iphone while the effort to write the 100 lines of java code to build an iphone app is minimal its just not needed
8638229 it allows iphone users to access salesforce crm applications and more than 70 000 force com custom applications right from their iphone
8638230 from a historic standpoint the mobile revolution began in the90s with the mass adoption of mobile phones as a primary means of communication mobile e mail became a way of life in the enterprise as consumers and professionals became more familiar with mobile devices and as mobile devices became more like mobile laptops end users increasingly desired and expected to be able to do everything from the mobile devices that they could do from their desks

8638235 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8638236 but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8638237 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8638238 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8638239 i was deciding do i want to have another baby

8638241 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic
8638242 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
8638243 we reiterate our request that the department of justice fulfill its commitment to take prompt action to investigate and to prosecute the american issues project and we further request that the department of justice investigate and prosecute howard sic simmons for a knowing and willful violation of the individual aggregate contribution limits
8638244 having failed in its attempts to get our legal factual and fully supported ad off the air barack obamas campaign now wants to put our donors in prison for exercising their right to free speech
8638245 these over the top bullying tactics are reminiscent of the kind of censorship one would see in a stalinist dictatorship with the only difference being that those guys generally had to wait until they were in power to throw people who disagreed with them into jail
8638246 typically actors are engaged and paid for their services to act its rare that they are paying their own way to be part of the movie
8638247 the rare occurrence where it would happen is if theyre investing in the entire budget for the movie like mel gibson did in the passion of the christ
8638248 mr rothstein did say that he contacted siebel newsom about a month ago
8638249 last time californians voted on this issue they were overwhelmingly in support
8638250 we know the other side is about to launch a major campaign against same sex marriage so we still have a lot of work to do
8638251 californians are going to be looking very closely at the presidential candidates and state elected leaders to see who has a plan or a solution for turning around the economy
8638252 the only thing they seem to agree on is theyre dissatisfied with their elected officials and the direction of the country
8638253 but there is no agreement on what to do about it

8638263 our financial results in recent years have mirrored the consistent improvement we have achieved in our business and we finish the year with a stronger business chief executive paul walsh said in the statement
8638264 we enter the new financial year facing slowing global growth and more challenging global economic trends
8638265 but given the strength and diversity of diageos business we believe we can deliver organic operating profit growth for the coming year within our range of 7 0 9 0 per cent mr walsh said
8638266 the main drivers of growth were international where scotch in latin america and beer in africa drove net sales growth of 16 per cent and north america where growth in the priority brands drove a 5 0 per cent increase in net sales mr walsh said
8638267 if it was going to have a major impact we would have seen it by now mr rose said
8638268 were not expecting a major downturn from here he said
8638269 worrying trends in european nations that are facing the likely prospect of a recession this year
8638270 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the
8638271 that is the mandate that he mugabe was given by the sadc southern african development community regional bloc and he is not going to stop forming that new cabinet
8638272 you will be killing the talks once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
8638273 once he does that forms a new government then he has put a final nail on this dialogue so what in fact you are doing is you are making people suffer and therefore declaring a war on the people
8638274 formally we are going to write a letter to the facilitator about the breaches that have occurred
8638275 i am not aware of that our hope is that all parties to the conflict in zimbabwe will abide by the agreement and finalise whatever outstanding issues that need to be finalised and signed
8638276 we still maintain that mediation is going on in zimbabwe
8638277 may be a strategy to arm twist the mdc to accept the deal that is on the table
8638278 the formation of a new government sends a message that talks my have collapsed
8638279 march 14 alliance and a rival coalition led by the syria and iran backed hezbollah was ended in may by a qatari mediated settlement
8638280 why should we give the syrians a pretext to intervene like in 76 when some christian villages were surrounded and the christians went to damascus and asked for syrian protection it could happen again now with the alawites
8638281 they feel like a minority and they know they could be protected
8638282 it has to be worked out step by step in every area in every quarter of beirut in every village in the media
8638283 weve got to live together we fixed up a joint security committee that is working on the ground
8638284 the further steps to ameliorate the situation are linked to the dialogue theres no way other than to fix up the dialogue
8638285 finally we might have it by the end of the year
8638286 you have the sea you have israel you have syria you cant select that
8638287 get excited about something in minnesota and you might as well paste a bumper sticker on your forehead that says im not from around here
8638288 we are looking at ways to cut costs and were looking at everything
8638289 its my position that this staff has been cut enough more than enough
8638290 its not like we wouldnt have entertainment content in the friday paper
8638291 but under that proposal it would not be in a tab form
8638292 i dont see much of a difference in our business
8638293 i do see kind of a difference in attitude i guess maybe its just my attitude but an entertainment pullout gives it more of a big city vibe as opposed to just a little paper
8638294 i know a lot of people use that weekly section because when theyre talking to me about the movies they always say i saw it in whats up
8638295 this french film were playing at the colony right now called tell no one got a stellar review and the business reflected that
8638296 sports is kind of the brave new world where weve taken this idea the farthest
8638297 and i do think there are possibilities to take it farther in features and business
8638298 i mean theres a reason you have local newspapers its to provide local content
8638299 i want our coverage to be local in this area
8638300 you have to think more and more about what you do thats unique and distinctive and exploit that if youre writing the same story that everybody else in the country is writing im not sure that makes sense for a regional newspaper
8638301 there is an increased sense of a worry about the future and a sadness about watching our paper change
8638302 i never dreamed this year would be as difficult financially as it has been and i never dreamed that we would be cut as much as weve been cut nobody likes any of that but everyone has stayed focused on the journalism were still breaking a lot of stories and doing a lot of good work under very difficult conditions with a lot of distractions its a great group of professionals and when push comes to shove they always do good work im really proud of that
8638303 our readership survey for the last year showed our print readership up more than 6 percent which is faster than the growth of population of a very fast growing area and our online readership was up more than twice that much
8638304 there is this popular belief that people arent reading newspapers anymore and its not true unfortunately advertisers are leaving us what i dont understand is why are advertisers leaving us when the readers are coming to us
8638305 new hope for a just and fair prosperity for the many and not just for the few and a guarantee for every american decent quality health care the cause of his life teddy said
8638306 the historical wealth of our cultural heritage is a truly grandiose resource for developing tourism
8638307 there are a lot of good people in that line
8638308 but there are about two dozen who think they have the run of the line theyre running dope or carrying out drug abuse with impunity
8638309 our direction is always to provide something that will help people heal
8638310 we dont want people to feel they will always have to stand in the food line they will have choices
8638311 i just want them to be a little more aggressive
8638312 we can arrest someone any time of the day but i think weve proved that law enforcement is not the answer a physical change is needed and glide is the key to that
8638313 presently your limited security staff is doing a very poor job of monitoring your line
8638314 the captain sent out that e mail on his own
8638315 i know that capt jimenez has done a lot of good work in the tenderloin and i expect him to partner together with the community to help fix this problem together
8638316 putting them in the parking lot is like being locked up in a cage
8638317 and it is such a limited area that it would create even more violent situations
8638318 we understand that these are real problems were very concerned
8638319 the people in security came from the lines originally we cant push them out there and say identify those dealers or ask them to stop them
8638320 the fact is you cant control that line when it is strung out all the way up the block and around the corner i think if they wanted to they could control that line
8638321 people are going to ask me what are you trying to do
8638322 i am going to tell them i am trying to displace that line so that the drug dealers get out
8638323 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on

8638326 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
8638327 san francisco residents and visitors alike can come out and enjoy san francisco like it has never been enjoyed before
8638328 if our business improves i will be more than happy to admit it if it doesnt ill let everyone know
8638329 with that lack of conversation the closure just doesnt make any sense
8638330 we look forward to seeing you we havent seen you for quite a while
8638331 we want some of the developing nations to do more
8638332 the 1992 u n climate convention did not provide for differentiation between developing countries
8638333 i cant predict where that debate is going to go
8638334 nations with binding commitments have not i repeat have not delivered on those commitments
8638335 its a principle of the law that a penalty should match the seriousness of the crime
8638336 ill be in your dream if youll be in mine
8638337 and im not just saying that because im the chairman of the hoofed animal caucus
8638338 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8638339 the 110th congress is an excellent target for mr mccain he ought to take careful aim at it and commence firing
8638340 hey john whats your problem this democrat congress funded your surge we gave immunity to your telecom partners in crime we supported your unconstitutional programs on both the domestic and the foreign fronts so whats your beef john
8638341 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8638342 and for the last seven years the administration has failed to face the biggest the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons the shortage of secure supplies of energy food and water the challenge of climate change and the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front in the war on terror
8638343 with russia challenging the very freedom of the new democratic country of georgia
8638344 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8638345 in response to this post on lrc heres pat buchanan on russian tv talking about the russo georgia conflict and here he is on the mclaughlin group talking about the same thing best of all here is him on msnbc telling everyone to go to ron pauls convention in minneapolis
8638346 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
8638347 first i should note that my wife god bless her is a yankees fan
8638348 as for me and my family they left the fandom of the evil empire back in the 50s when my grandfather and a number of other ushers at yankee stadium jumped over to the polo grounds to work for the lew rockwell
8638349 tell me what democracy looks like this is what democracy looks like
8638350 i just cant imagine driving through my neighborhood at home and seeing a security checkpoint
8638351 it was an old farmhouse it had a barn in the back with a stall for a horse
8638352 the roof was leaking the basement would flood and if we didnt hear the sump pumps turn on wed have to go down there with buckets and boots

8638359 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8638360 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8638361 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8638362 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences

8638386 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8638387 hopefully well get in enough snaps with the first offensive line that both can play
8638388 i just wanted to make sure kurt gets his timing with the ones for this game much like we did in kansas city
8638389 we cant verify if its random but at this time nothing indicates they were the intended targets
8638390 thank you for all that you have done for this nation and its undeserving people
8638391 if we as the silent majority dont speak up this time then we would have surrendered our decency and freedom to thieves
8638392 fixing the system with american or uk systems will be just mimickery sic at best that will produce great thieves or worse third rate actors
8638393 busharraf is the correct name to be honest he should be killed in the same brutal manner the way mushy musharraf killed thousands of innocent true muslims
8638394 how can a general get an expensive villa even if he makes rs 300 000 4 000 a month how long would he have to save to make so much money
8638395 i think musharraf should be tried he violated the constitution not just once but twice being an army officer does it give him a licence to commit crimes
8638396 if the cell is constantly bombarded by the negative peptides from chronic stress like abusive living situations war depression marital strife trauma response from rape abandonment homelessness death of a loved one even financial stresses or a long period of unemployment the cells will produce more receptor sites for the negative peptides and less sites for the positive peptides
8638397 so stress sadness despondency anger amp aggression worry jealousy becomes the natural state of the cell the cells themselves begin to forget how to feel pleasure the body and the minds ability to be happy is actually degraded and the longer this persists the greater the shift in receptor site loci this is why mom always told you it is no good to bear a grudge

8638428 preserving the integrity of the investigative details of a case of this magnitude is paramount to its successful conclusion we are unable to comment any further on information that has recently surfaced regarding the caylee anthony investigation any future returns in regards to evidence or submissions pertaining to this case will remain privileged or exempt unless the release of such information will be beneficial to the investigation or if it becomes a matter of public record in a legal proceeding
8638429 it smells like there was a dead body in the damn car

8638431 you know the car was parked next to a dumpster i would hate to think the worst god its terrible to think shed be at the local garbage dump its terrible to think that
8638432 after reading it i dont believe i would have talked my nephew tony padilla into posting the bond and i dont think i would have come to orlando after reading that i mean im still hoping that little girls alive but theres a lot of information in those 400 pages that would lead those people to believe something different
8638433 cold callous and a monster who doesnt care whos just trying to get away with something
8638434 may not be the way we or the way your family last remembers her we need to find out from you where caylee is this this this right now is just this has gone so far down hill and this has become such a mess
8638435 we need to end it its very simple we just need to end it
8638436 i agree with you i have no clue where she is
8638437 what is given can be taken away everyone lies everyone dies
8638438 caylees out there somewhere and her rotting body is starting to decompose

8638452 have convinced themselves that obama is not honorable that he does not love his country as much as himself that makes it easier to justify doing whatever is necessary to defeat him especially if its done in the pursuit of honor
8638453 mccain at first seemed happy enough to do the interview but his mood quickly soured the mccain on display in the 24 minute interview was prickly at times abrasive and determined not to stray off message
8638454 gop conclaves work like the docile old horse at the petting zoo this year everything is different to attract votes beyond the base mccains convention must trumpet his peerless credentials as a reformer he must engage passionately on middle class economic issues mccains comfort zone may be world affairs but if he cannot hold his own in a kitchen table debate with obama on jobs schools and health care hell visit ticket splitting kitchens once more on election day but this time as toast finally he must give the convention speech of a lifetime

8638459 for the people who have been involved for the last couple of years who have worked long and hard with this its a validation
8638460 when you get the award from hockey nova scotia it makes you believe you are rolling in the right direction
8638461 if hockey nova scotia is willing to recognize us for that then it shows our membership that we are doing the right thing
8638462 we wanted somebody to be in place to not just be there for the kids but be there for the coaches who then can deliver the message to the kids
8638463 for bedford minor hockey its not just about winning its the development of each and every individual player to be the best that they can
8638464 that was our objective to have that person in place
8638465 i think what sen obama wants to do is make sure everyone watching at home is going to have a clear sense of where he wants to take the country that were on the wrong path and barack obama is going to put us back on the right track both here at home and overseas
8638466 i think im more in touch with the american people as far as my policies my proposals and my ideas
8638467 this roman like facade a facade with roman columns is a perfect metaphor or icon for the point that its an interesting production but behind it theres not much there
8638468 my goodness its amazing that were three days into the democratic convention and 60 or so days from the actual election and theyre still trying to plead with the american people and convince us that barack obama is ready to be president
8638469 and it becomes obviously an even greater moment in november if hes elected
8638470 i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8638471 the day before i started coaching murray i didnt know him at all
8638472 there was a big age difference and a culture difference
8638473 andy is very argumentative if he feels strongly about something a lot of people in his team gave into him i didnt so we would argue about sports mostly
8638474 he lives a quiet relaxed life focused on being a tennis player but he is obsessed with video games i dont play video games
8638475 people expect me to be bitter but im not look around and youll see how many coaches get fired
8638476 we still speak he is now doing a lot of things i was asking him to do like being much more aggressive and stop hitting so many damn drop shots
8638477 the fbi shouldnt have the unreviewable power to impose gag orders on the recipients of national security letters
8638478 as the district court ruled the fbis power to silence the recipients of these letters has to be subject to judicial oversight without that check the fbi can use its power to hide abuses and silence its critics and thats exactly what its been doing
8638479 parents not the public schools should be responsible for deciding whether their children receive religious education

8638501 when you compare to other cities sydney has just built nothing
8638502 this study shows that the state government has been asleep at the wheel since the 1920s in terms of public transport
8638503 that means that areas of high density in the middle ring suburbs arent adequately serviced by the infrastructure
8638504 we havent built any significant public transport since the 1920s
8638505 since the harbour bridge was opened in 1932 weve completed the circular quay line in the 1950s and finished the east hills and eastern suburbs lines the airport link was one of the bigger jobs but look at it it is only four stations
8638506 the comparisons clearly show there has been an underinvestment in public transport in the sydney city centre compared with other global cities

8638510 they asked him questions in relation to various aspects of school life whether father spillane may have been suspected of interfering with boys he couldnt put his finger on any specific incident in light of a complaint being made now he thinks there is room for concern
8638511 he was a teacher who was employed by the school he had been convicted of an offence and police saw he was someone they could talk to about this
8638512 he has been guaranteed by police he is not a subject of any investigation he has led a very exemplary lifestyle since then he hasnt worked with children he fully acknowledges what he did was wrong
8638513 its time that we started to concentrate on the 80 per cent of folks out there that dont do anything wrong and really start to meet their needs
8638514 id like to be in a position to say that within so many hours or days of a crime being committed against you you get a chance to talk to a detective if its a crime that needs to be followed up by a detective
8638515 it may well be more a matter of the follow up after youve reported it that within so many days well get back to you well tell you whats happening with it
8638516 thats the really important stuff thats what the community is telling us is the big issue what happens after the event
8638517 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8638518 candidate mccain now supports the wartime tax cuts that senator mccain once denounced as immoral

8638520 are you kidding talk about being for it before youre against it
8638521 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief

8638527 the single greatest strength america has in the middle east
8638528 you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
8638529 did the self proclaimed zionist biden pull the plug on carter or was it obama
8638530 nobody can believe how much keith olbermann is getting away with
8638531 sanitation and availability of drinking water are going to be highly restrained therefore there is always the possibility of water borne diseases and some epidemics breaking out unless disease surveillance happens and proper health care facilities are provided especially to the vulnerable groups like children and women
8638532 the biggest concern is clearly that the discharge is expected to increase in the coming months it can double
8638533 therefore the biggest threat comes from the water which is coming from upstream so rains will clearly make things much worse
8638534 he has just been admitted for abdominal discomfort investigation will commence tomorrow morning and there is no cause for concern
8638535 we cannot tell you for how many days he will stay in the hospital at the moment
8638536 the fact is that the inability to compel the attendance of the witnesses is a serious if not fatal blow to the defense in the removal proceedings
8638537 the governors refusal to seek subpoena power combined with the refusal of the witnesses to appear voluntarily deprives

8638539 anwar whatever we think of him and many of us are deeply skeptical is looking more and more like our future prime minister
8638540 there is a mounting sense of inevitability to his impending succession
8638541 we have walked out because they have refused to respond
8638542 so theres no point in staying and participating in this debate
8638543 if heat is provided as a service included in the rent it cannot be interrupted and must be available through the tenancy
8638544 hes a former employee of a long john silvers in knoxville
8638545 two of his former managers at long john silvers called us because they recognized him
8638546 some items of interest were found in his car but we dont want to elaborate on that right now
8638547 we already know he is a rock star we already know he can bring 85 000 people together in a stadium he has done it multiple times he needs to talk to people who havent made up their minds yet
8638548 i dont think thats the right thing but they are not asking me and they have got a great track record so far
8638549 i would love to see him out showing a certain kind of humility being in touch with people who go to breakfast at the waffle house sending a message

8638562 any members violating the provision of this section shall be subject to expulsion
8638563 but as executives they knew being in the forefront of the establishment of a new collecting body was against the musiga laws nana is the general secretary so he is more or less a mouth piece of musiga and he knew of the collecting society we were putting in place so for him to even be the leader of this other body grossly contravenes musigas constitution
8638564 we just didnt get up last week to suspend them when we got wind of what they were doing we issued them with a query letter first on may 5 but they still went ahead with their plans they knew the suspension was coming so it is a shame that they are now saying the move is political she said

8638572 despite barry ofarrells economic vandalism we cannot stand still and let the state suffer we must do whats necessary to secure nsw future electricity supplies
8638573 we would urge the liberal party to reconsider supporting the sale this should be seen as bigger than politics
8638574 this is in the states long term interest and it shouldnt be viewed as a short term issue
8638575 you knew that your career was in danger you hoped that if you performed the procedure then the sexual act would not be disclosed by the patient
8638576 no podemos dejar de ver esos antecedentes porque los consejos de los centros universitarios y el consejo de educaci n media superior aprobaron un paquete de reformas normativas que significan un enorme avance en la descentralizaci n un proceso que por cierto el propio carlos brise o apoy hace cinco meses al firmar el documento sustantivo contenido adem s en el plan de desarrollo institucional de la universidad
8638577 hubo desesperaci n en la respuesta medi tica su tono tan elocuente y sus acusaciones es una puesta en escena de histrionismo desaforado
8638578 no se ha salido en un a o de su discurso es lo mismo me parece evidente que no tiene un proyecto de reforma universitaria ni de renovaci n real
8638579 es vergonzoso evidentemente una sobreactuaci n que pone en duda su salud emocional es un acto de venganza pol tica pues est desbaratando el aparato cultural sin establecer criterios de desempe o y resultados y puede tener enormes consecuencias pues va a mandar al despe adero un trabajo que es patrimonio no s lo de la udeg sino de jalisco

8638583 en efecto se ha derrumbado el mito ra l padilla me quede o no de rector eso es irrelevante ya el mito de ra l padilla se ha derrumbado
8638584 de repente se sinti iluminado y de ah tom las decisiones que iba a anunciar hace rato que se siente iluminado ya hay manifestaciones de que los universitarios no tenemos por qu acostumbrarnos a que esta actitud espirituada lo tenga tomando estas decisiones terminar entrando en raz n y cualquier d a de stos nos sorprende con su renuncia
8638585 son opiniones desafortunadas las del rector yo no creo que se deba polarizar la universidad de guadalajara porque son 210 mil alumnos que necesitan paz tranquilidad equilibrios y un trabajo estable
8638586 no s si sea casualidad que est n ocurriendo las mismas cosas en diferentes espacios al mismo tiempo o que haya un nimo de alguien o de un grupo por generar un clima de divisi n en el estado
8638587 la autoridad responsable en este caso el consejo general universitario se abstenga de remover o destituir del cargo de rector general de la universidad de guadalajara al quejoso carlos brise o torres hasta en tanto reciba la notificaci n de lo que se resuelva al dictar la suspensi n definitiva de este sumario incidental
8638588 ninguna mayor a puede estar por encima de la ley estoy completamente seguro de que no he cometido ninguna irregularidad he cuidado en extremo el cumplimiento estricto de la ley

8638917 three weeks after stephan died his friends came forward and told me that he been playing the choking game
8638918 i searched his room after he died looking for anything some type of note that would indicate that he was unhappy or hated life
8638919 he had bloodshot eyes was locking his door was getting more headaches and i saw a mark on his neck one time
8638920 he explained it away as horsing around the signs were there but i didnt know what to look for at the time and they were spread out enough that i didnt connect them together
8638921 what i found is that most of the kids playing this game dont do drugs he was a happy normal 14 year old and popular within his group of friends there were other times when i heard strange noises from his room but i thought he was doing things a normal 14 year old boy would do that a mom really doesnt want to see
8638922 when his friends told me what stephan had been doing i went to the authorities and they told me the choking game was urban legend
8638923 they never asked me any questions about stephan as to his state of mind they simply ruled his death a suicide and wont talk to me any more about it

8638949 a way to raise appropriate concern about a deadly concern
8638950 you or i might think a hot dog that just goes with baseball we can always change our traditions to be healthful
8638951 its not the kind of impact on risk that say tobacco smoking has on lung cancer but on the other hand colon cancer is one of our most common cancers so small changes still affect a lot of people
8638952 the risk we get from things like lack of physical activity excess body weight lack of adequate vegetables and fruits these are much more important to work on than to worry about

8639034 weve played four average sides not outstanding sides but theyve worked hard been organised and were not dealing with route one balls over the top
8639035 were getting punished due to individual errors and not defending properly as a team
8639036 the club expects more we expect more and the lads were devastated after losing to kendal

8639046 its not good enough we need to improve in that aspect if we are to progress in this league

8639121 our thermal drill is like a classical melting probe equipped with two propellers that drill into the ice we mechanically open up the hole in the ice and by this move the ice particles backwards where they will be melted the slurry of water and ice will be pushed backwards by the weight of the probe
8639122 one advantage of melting is that you can produce heat directly to melt through the ice so there are no losses due to the translation into mechanical power
8639123 integrating a drilling mechanism will avoid your melting probe from simply getting stuck into a layer of sand while penetrating the ice a scenario likely on the planet mars for example a hybrid thermal drill will be able to penetrate even layers that cannot be melted

8639162 ausl ser f r den jetzigen baustein boom waren meiner meinung nach die low cost airlines die gezeigt haben dass auch der flug sehr billig sein kann und so eine alternative zur pauschalreise entstand dieser preisvorteil kann sich aber relativieren wenn der flugbaustein teurer wird
8639163 die gesch ftsmodelle der low cost carrier geraten durch die hohen kerosinpreise gewaltig unter druck
8639164 dass bei steigenden lpreise die pauschalreiseanbieter zahlreiche vorteile gegen ber billigfliegern und selbst organisierten reisen haben
8639165 in zeiten reduzierter kaufkraft und zahlreicher preiserh hungen werden individuelle reisen schon allein durch die hohen treibstoffpreise immer teurer ich erwarte die wiedererstarkung der pausschalreise f r den winter 08 09 sowie f r die sommersaison 2009
8639166 die pauschalreise lag schon in den vergangenen jahren deutlich unter der allgemeinen preissteigerung sie wird ihr comeback feiern auch wenn sie nie wirklich out war
8639167 die mineral lunternehmen halten sich selbstverst ndlich streng an die gesetzlich vorgeschriebenen preisauszeichnungskriterien und werden das auch in zukunft tun dass sich preise regelm ig ndern zeigt aber nur wie dynamisch und volatil dieser markt ist und wie sehr die verbraucherpreise an den spot markt gebunden sind der dynamische markt nutzt dem konsumenten
8639168 preis nderungen auf einem freien markt sind keine besonderheit die angef hrten beispiele f r die irref hrung von verbrauchern erscheinen daher bei n herer betrachtung eher theoretisch h ufiges ndern der treibstoffpreise zugunsten der verbraucher z b durch wiederholtes senken der treibstoffpreise ist im sinne der verbraucher da sie den wettbewerb f rdern ebenso ist jede sachlich rechtfertigbare nderung des treibstoffpreises als nicht irref hrend anzuerkennen nur so k nnen sich tankstellenbetreiber im wettbewerb an den verlangten preisen ihrer konkurrenten orientieren und auf entsprechende preisbewegungen reagieren
8639169 manchester city can exclusively reveal that shaun wright phillips has rejoined the club

8639172 to actually secure the deal and bring shaun back home is a fantastic coup for us and im sure the supporters will be just as excited as we are to have him back at manchester city

8639181 before the focus was on a green product now consumers are aware that a green end product is not enough
8639182 they want to know how the products are derived manufactured and formulated in short the process has to be as green as the product itself
8639183 clearly consistent research needs to be conducted to continue to find the most environmentally friendly ways to both produce and deliver a product to the consumer
8639184 now if youre driving without a license theyll take your car and you have no way of getting it back without papers
8639185 people are intimidated were not used to seeing so many police on the street
8639186 especially now with the problem of undocumented and drivers licenses
8639187 this is a law in denver however its under legal review to figure out how to implement it we have not given the city permission to implement it
8639188 imagine they only approved this ordinance a month ago and now with all the police we cant even go downtown
8639189 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
8639190 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8639191 so there we have it the man running for president on the democratic ticket supports selective infanticide his running mate is a pro abortion catholic the delegates are wildly out of step with americans on abortion and the speaker of the house hasnt a clue what her religion teaches on the subject

8639203 the democratization of communication technologies means more and more potential entrepreneurs can reach their niche audiences
8639204 and one marketplace teeming with this brand of democratization is interestingly the place where notions of democracy are discussed every day the marketplace of ideas during this political campaign season the confluence of these two phenomena means niche marketers can reach their target audiences in powerful ways to generate niche related revenue

8639360 whales as living organisms at the top of the marine ecosystem are extremely important for protecting the ocean environment and we should therefore pay close attention to how they are treated
8639361 the fisheries agency also needs to strive in future to protect the marine ecosystem by revising its own lethal research programme which has led to the deaths of almost 8 700 whales in whale sanctuaries across the southern oceans and move on to non lethal means of conducting research on whales

8639379 if we keep accelerating the rate at which we are able to save these very little babies we are likely to see more cases of cerebral palsy in which case we havent saved them neurologically
8639380 if we can prevent that outcome in only a few cases a year we will have done a tremendous thing
8639381 its not a new medication or one that isnt already widely used
8639382 we probably give magnesium sulfate to 100 women to prevent one seizure

8639409 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation

8639411 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8639412 it is a big mistake for politicians to talk theology

8639430 the special products provision alone could effectively negate any market access gains that might occur from a formula tariff cut
8639431 it allows developing countries to designate 12 percent to 13 percent of their tariff lines as special to take no tariff cuts on 5 percent of lines and to take only a 10 percent cut in tariffs on special products overall
8639432 to put this in perspective a 10 percent cut in a 40 percent ad valorem tariff leaves a 36 percent ad valorem tariff most economists agree that a developing country could use this level of special product provisions to shield virtually all economically significant tariff lines
8639433 in addition to this and other loopholes the lamy proposal would have allowed developing countries to use a special safeguard mechanism to increase tariffs in some instances to levels that are higher than the bound tariff rates currently in place
8639434 it would have been a bizarre outcome if the united states brought back a negotiating text that actually decreased market access for some us agriculture exports
8639435 u s agricultures message to u s negotiators was clear
8639436 the united states is giving up 34 billion in allowable domestic support while getting virtually no market access in return and while allowing china to essentially take a free ride through these negotiations this is unacceptable
8639437 there would be no credible argument there was a balance between u
8639438 the fact he almost succeeded is a testament to lamys considerable influence and determination
8639439 the fact the united states almost found itself with a doha agreement that no segment of the u s economy could root for demonstrates how far off course this negotiation has gone
8639440 as a result the united states entered the geneva meetings with little chance of closing enough of these loopholes to make a difference still administration negotiators went to geneva with optimism and worked extremely hard for a deal
8639441 this accreditation is a testament to an intensive and concerted effort on behalf of our laboratory employees

8639443 north carolinas livestock and poultry industries represent a 5 billion industry having a diagnostic laboratory system that is accredited gives us an additional weapon in protecting against foreign animal diseases we know our test results are highly accurate based on national standards for testing

8639456 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo heads performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers

8639468 right now publishers are on a crash course with e textbooks they are expensive and impractical for a large portion of the student population

8639470 i do know that 25 000 marines in a province again are probably in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security

8639523 as a result the united states entered the geneva meetings with little chance of closing enough of these loopholes to make a difference still administration negotiators went to geneva with optimism and worked extremely hard for a deal
8639524 i tried to become aware of their problems and figure out as a state funded agency how we might help them with some kind of solution
8639525 they were usually able to apply two to three more irrigations but only about 75 percent of the total amount of water
8639526 we did a lot of field demonstrations to look at reducing the heavy amounts of irrigation including looking at watering every two three and four weeks on grain sorghum and sugar beets and measured tailwater runoff
8639527 when i first started natural gas was 25 cents an mcf thousand cubic feet and it had risen to 2 per mcf
8639528 i tried to help growers identify their inefficient pumps we tested about 3 000 wells powered with natural gas diesel and electric motors this gave us a good database to work with
8639529 this data allows producers to compare and it has helped them become the efficient irrigators they are today
8639530 high and wide that was the center pivot in the early 80s
8639531 but we didnt have a water applicator at the bottom of the drop lines that would spray or bubble the water out
8639532 so i used a one liter pepsi bottle turned upside down to attach to the drop hose
8639533 we did 18 different demonstrations with different growers three or four consecutive years in different areas on different crops
8639534 i was working with harold clark up in moore county and we had a span if the center pivot equipped with lepa
8639535 when i walked out under the last span of the system my boots got a little muddy but when i walked out under the adjacent retrofitted span i sunk above my ankles
8639536 thats when i became convinced this system had a lot to offer our growers
8639537 thats when we could determine how much less water should be applied
8639538 we went from applying 7 5 gallons per minute per acre on corn to 5 5 gallons per minute per acre and from 5 to 3 gallons per minute per acre on cotton
8639539 that proved up and it is what we use today still
8639540 it is probably not advisable to drive before six weeks after bunion surgery on the right foot our research shows that the reflexes and the power required to brake suddenly in an emergency is fully returned only at six weeks in the post operative period
8639541 however it is extremely important for all patients to discuss when they can return to driving with their surgeon after having any type of surgery to their foot
8639542 its a short term solution because were using antibiotics more than wed like but it is working
8639543 it reduces the amount of group b strep in the vagina so there is less exposure to the baby during delivery
8639544 some of the estimates are more than twice that number are being given antibiotics because people arent following the protocol closely

8639550 were not delaware but were awfully close and were extremely proud of joe biden
8639551 were proud because hes earned it with an extraordinary career of helping people
8639552 for the longest time when we didnt have a democratic senator when we needed help we called joe biden
8639553 i have every confidence in the world that no matter how tough it gets no matter how rocky the road gets joe biden will be as loyal to u s sen barack obama as loyal to the people hes fighting for as hes been to his own family
8639554 when things get tough some people jump off the side of the boat with joe biden youll never hear that splash in the water
8639555 my entire career i am so proud of representing my state but you know scranton never leaves you pennsylvania never leaves you
8639556 it really feels like things have come full circle for me

8639560 basically were looking for service with connections throughout the region as far as denver and seattle for example
8639561 he is eligible to attend cal poly as there is no basis under title 5 or the california education code that precludes him from enrolling in classes
8639562 if he was my son my suggestion to him would be to try and get this behind him whatever it might be and you just dont know what that is yet but whatever it is be close to home
8639563 wouldnt answer questions about whether he had been asked to provide financial and personal information from screening
8639564 asked by ktis host dave clutter whether he had any announcements pawlenty said he was going to be vice president of his fantasy football league
8639565 about 32 percent of respondents said theyd favor mccain if he picked romney thats double the number of those who said theyd be less inclined to back the ticket
8639566 he said he saw the criticism as the politics of jealousy or envy or a sense that somehow were going to be less likely to vote for someone because theyve achieved economic success
8639567 jindal also has asked for a federal state of emergency a request that has not yet been answered
8639568 we dont want to lay shoulder to shoulder head to head
8639569 were going to be doing some scenes where we tag team some guys
8639570 hes a great american and a great and dear friend and i rely on him and i have for many years
8639571 hes a former marine and great guy and hes older than i am so that might work
8639572 those are questions for the mccain campaign and i think they are going to make their announcement shortly

8639590 the georgia conflict appears to reaffirm the commissions continued policy on strengthening the security of europes energy supply including by means of diversification
8639591 it was unlikely to happen anyway and what has happened in georgia has made it a whole lot less likely
8639592 russias actions in georgia make those central asian gas producers even less likely to risk jeopardising their relationship with moscow for a pro western route
8639593 conscious of the underlying principle that the market is best placed to deliver required investment
8639594 if you looked at commercial factors alone the soviets would never have built the pipeline infrastructure from siberia to eastern europe in the first place and now europe relies on that pipeline network
8639595 finding enough supplies is the big problem and it cannot be solved just by the efforts of the companies in the nabucco consortium
8639596 russia is holding political talks to buy out the available gas from the caspian region i believe the eu should also hold such political talks
8639597 the way germany sees this is the best way to reduce insecurity of supply is not to cut russia out but to cut dependence on potentially troublesome transit countries
8639598 my current case is essentially to do with my treatment at the highest levels of the met in particular the discrimination i have been subjected to over a long period by the present commissioner sir ian blair
8639599 when theres so many discrimination cases coming out by ethnic minorities that speaks for itself
8639600 i think that there are even further allegations against sir ian at the moment which are probably just as serious i think its an accumulation of many allegations against him
8639601 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile but is morally treasonable to the american people
8639602 government has a final responsibility for the well being of its citizenship if private cooperative endeavor fails to provide work for willing hands and relief for the unfortunate those suffering hardship from no fault of their own have a right to call upon the government for aid and a government worthy of its name must make fitting response
8639603 i am not an advocate for frequent changes in laws and constitutions but laws must and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind as that becomes more developed more enlightened as new discoveries are made new truths discovered and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times we might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him when a boy as civilized society to remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors
8639604 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
8639605 all men having power ought to be distrusted to a certain degree
8639606 i believe in human dignity as the source of national purpose in human liberty as the source of national action in the human heart as the source of national compassion and in the human mind as the source of our invention and our ideas it is i believe the faith in our fellow citizens as individuals and as people that lies at the heart of the liberal faith for liberalism is not so much a party creed or set of fixed platform promises as it is an attitude of mind and heart a faith in mans ability through the experiences of his reason and judgment to increase for himself and his fellow men the amount of justice and freedom and brotherhood which all human life deserves
8639607 should any political party attempt to abolish social security unemployment insurance and eliminate labor laws and farm programs you would not hear of that party again in our political history there is a tiny splinter group of course that believes you can do these things among them are a few other texas oil millionaires and an occasional politician or business man from other areas their number is negligible and they are stupid

8639638 you realize its just a small little thing that is so appreciated
8639639 i didnt have a clue you could go into 15 000 debt in one night
8639640 when i saw that bill i was just kind of numb
8639641 two thirds of the people who go into medical debt have insurance
8639642 when medical debt hits it hits very quickly its a jolt and its generally not very predictable
8639643 the most dangerous thing people do when they get into debt is ignore the statements and notices
8639644 they think doctors and hospitals wont send them to collection agencies but they absolutely will
8639645 i had a client once who was charged for a surgery she never had
8639646 another one was charged more than 5 000 for disposable gloves
8639647 people think they have to pay the amount on the bill but doctors and hospitals are very willing to negotiate
8639648 she could afford to pay 4 000 so i told her show them a certified check for 4 000 she did and told them this is all i have in the world and they took it
8639649 my whole life ive tried to be smart with money
8639650 now ive had to empty out my 401 k to pay for all this
8639651 dont take a no from the customer service representative on the other end of the 800 number
8639652 i used to run hospitals so i know how these things are priced
8639653 just because a procedure costs 10 000 at one hospital doesnt mean you cant find it for 5 000 down the road
8639654 patients need to learn to be a lot smarter and a lot savvier about their health care
8639655 we have learned a lot since building the mcintosh plant in alabama and i believe the time is right technically environmentally and economically for a large scale deployment of energy storage and powers caes technology
8639656 the system allows for several hours or even days of stored energy which allows power producers to make electricity during off peak hours when the demand for electricity and price is highest

8639683 basically its a logistical thing the size of the show
8639684 its a matter of moving the production around the country not the size of the set
8639685 we get overlooked with international acts so often now its happened with kylie
8639686 shes australian surely its not too much to ask to put on another show it would be good to give her queensland fans a showing
8639687 its always disappointing if brisbane and queensland miss out on a major event
8639688 we hope that in 2009 or 2010 she will return to brisbane
8639689 with the price of tickets flights and accommodation its just too expensive
8639690 she puts on such a good show and brisbane deserves that
8639691 i saw pink last year and was hoping to see kylie this year so i am really disappointed
8639692 its been such a joy to take this show to so many countries that ive never been to before but its a real thrill to finally be bringing it home to australia and to be able to share it with you all
8639693 todo el mundo salvo mi mam dec a que deb a tener un aborto mi pap incluso concert una cita en la cl nica ah trataron de convencerme de que era s lo una masa de c lulas y que todo ser a muy r pido
8639694 en la escuela mis amigos la mayor a de los cuales no sab a de la violaci n no pod an entender por qu alguien de mi edad querr a tener un beb en vez de un aborto y los pocos a los que cont lo sucedido se horrorizaban m s al saber que pretend a tener al beb pero yo lo hice y no me arrepiento ni por un momento
8639695 cada vez que miro a phoebe s que tom la decisi n correcta nunca quise poner fin a la vida de mi beb s lo por la forma en que fue concebida
8639696 me sorprende lo f cil que surgi el amor por mi hija mientras crec a dentro de m pero debo admitir que tem a que mis sentimientos cambiaran cuando la viera por primera vez
8639697 pero ella no me record esa noche y al tenerla supe que estar con ella era m s importante que lo que hab a ocurrido
8639698 no pude considerar entregarla en adopci n mi madre fue abandonada de beb en una estaci n de trenes de londres y eso la afect mucho crec rechazando que alguien pudiera abandonar a un ni o inocente
8639699 la gente puede pensar que no es posible amar a un ni o concebido de esa forma pero cr anme la amo m s justamente por eso
8639700 nunca he culpado a phoebe por lo ocurrido aunque lo ocurrido fue aterrador saber que iba a ser madre me ayud a concentrarme en otra cosa supuse que deb a tratar de ver m s all de lo ocurrido y ver la vida que se hab a creado
8639701 ahora l la ama y eso es lo importante s que necesita una figura paterna en su vida
8639702 overseas filipino workers in the middle east who can now catch our market live through our online brokers
8639703 by the time they have the chance to do so the pse is already closing
8639704 i vividly recall one overseas filipino working in abu dhabi who said that he has to wake up at 5 00 oclock in the morning just to be able to trade in the philippines because the pse is open only up to 12 noon with the special incentives for them under the pera law and afternoon trading hours we hope to tap overseas filipinos as active players in our stock market
8639705 if you really want to get folks riled up dont talk politics or religion name the place you think has the best barbecue here it is arthur bryants in kansas city mo yes i know the venerable mr bryant has gone on to his reward yes i know theyve branched out so go to the original on brooklyn avenue where in a setting that can be called simple youll feast on the most sublime tender ribs you can imagine ive tried barbecue all over the country and this remains my favorite
8639706 this was why god put the ticket in his hands
8639707 called me invited me to his home told me he had won and his intentions he said he wanted to bless the church
8639708 this would make it much harder to move to 30 cuts automatically as the eu would have to go through the whole co decision procedure and it could even prevent it altogether

8639711 cada a o son m s los turistas que se acercan hasta el municipio y solicitan informaci n en los distintos puntos de informaci n tur stica que ha habilitado el ayuntamiento

8639713 estemos de nuevo ante una muestra m s del sectarismo que est caracterizando al gobierno de canarias con este ayuntamiento
8639714 mucho nos tememos apunta el alcalde que estamos siendo objeto de una persecuci n pol tica no contra esta instituci n sino contra los vecinos de san sebasti n de la gomera por el cambio de color pol tico del pasado 25 de julio
8639715 la cronolog a de los hechos contin a el edil se inicia el pasado 12 de junio cuando se presenta ante el gobierno regional una solicitud de subvenci n conforme a lo dispuesto a las bases reguladoras publicadas el 29 de mayo en el bolet n oficial de canarias boc para la potenciaci n y homogeneizaci n de la polic a local a la que se adjuntaba toda la documentaci n requerida incluida la certificaci n de estar al corriente de la hacienda canaria
8639716 las entregas de bienes y prestaciones de servicios realizados por el estado la comunidad auton ma de canarias y las entidades locales canarias est n exentas del impuesto general indirecto canario
8639717 de conformidad con el art culo 28 del decreto 182 1992 de 15 de diciembre por el que se aprueban las normas de gesti n de dicho impuesto los empresarios o profesionales que realicen operaciones exentas no tienen obligaci n de presentar declaraciones censales ni autoliquidaciones
8639718 es decir que este ayuntamiento est exento de pagar el igic en este caso y sirviendo el certificado emitido de estar al corriente con la hacienda canaria por tanto no tenemos obligaci n de presentar declaraciones censales ni autoliquidaciones tal y como le hicimos saber al gobierno regional en un escrito de fecha 15 de julio en el que contest bamos a su requerimiento de adjuntar dicha documentaci n
8639719 in 1997 the fiscal situation was grimmer for indian states when increased expenditure on wages and salaries resulted in increased borrowing engulfing some states in a fiscal crisis and trapping them in a vicious cycle of debt
8639720 now there is a marked difference in present growth and the states fiscal situations even with a forecasted slowdown in fy09 economic growth is expected to be 7 7 whereas economic growth in fy97 was a comparatively meagre 4 3

8639989 i remember when i was a kid watching wrestling i think jake the snake and rick rude had an angle for a whole year it literally lasted a year nowadays if you can go two months with somebody its like oh my gosh we got a lot out of that one this one has been six months and going with no signs of slowing down its hotter now than it ever has been definitely its one of the best if not this best angle ive ever been involved with in my entire career
8639990 it takes a while for people to get used to a new look a new image and a new mindset when they were getting used to it i changed it up into something completely new and different and not playing the old y2j character that was very sarcastic and over the top i wanted to take it all the way down to where if i talk slow and whisper almost the fans are going to have to shut up and listen to what i have to say because im in control im in control every night i go into that ring every night i say something do something or wrestle im the one that calls the shots not the fans

8639996 if you have a team that needs to develop a winning attitude then its really important that you win
8639997 it varies by team and were somewhere in the middle weve got young quarterbacks corners so id say were a young team were also young as far as winning goes because we havent done a whole lot of it around here
8639998 hopefully it will be a more consistent step than we saw in detroit but each game is different im sure the bears will put some pressure on him to see if we can handle it better than we did last week
8639999 i just want to be more consistent put more points on the board and really show much better execution on my part
