9120229 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9120230 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9120231 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9120232 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9120233 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9120234 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9120235 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9120236 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9120264 bennetts death could have been prevented by installing stricter penalties for sex offenders
9120265 in front of you are pictures of a precious life that has been lost
9120266 why how could this possibly have happened never again should even one more child be the victim of a predator who remains free through a series of a broken criminal justice systems failings
9120267 every time the phone rang our bodies would shake from the inside out
9120268 our hearts sunk into our chest how was this man allowed unrestricted access to young girls
9120269 i find it very difficult to believe the justice system let him go
9120270 i think something needs to change and it needs to change as soon as possible
9120271 every time i look at the news i see these crimes against children and it just tears me up
9120272 i cant understand why the state is letting this happen
9120273 this 25 year minimum is the least they should get as far as im concerned
9120274 if the state doesnt do something about it the people will
9120275 these cases are the hardest cases to prove ive witnessed two trials in three years both were found not guilty and in both cases the defendants re victimized
9120276 if jessicas law is passed theres the potential for more cases to go to trial and more perpetrators going free
9120277 if anyone thinks that one law is going to change things without a complete comprehensive package it wont
9120278 weve been vilified threatened and had our characters attacked were not going to take it anymore
9120279 now would be a good time for someone two sic sneak in at night and burn the house down with all the sex offenders in it
9120280 i was okay with our teacher assignment until i realized that not only is my sons new teacher a man wait for it mitch mcdad dont get your boxers in a bunch just yet he is also young and single
9120281 do you think it is appropriate or inappropriate for young men to be teaching the little ones
9120282 if i had a male teacher in my k 3rd grades i would have freaked
9120283 most people really want men teaching their children but it does happen occasionally
9120284 i had a parent who was complaining and concerned about me working with her daughter
9120285 the kid really liked me a lot and because the child was liking me so much the mother got worried and suspicious
9120286 people dont think of men as caretaking or nurturing which many of the young grades require
9120287 and if youre a single man and youre going out to date somebody when they ask you what do you do it just doesnt have the same cache as saying im an engineer or a scientist
9120288 i was about to graduate and was applying to schools hoping to find a teaching job the teacher asked what grade i would like to teach and i was surprised that she kind of laughed when i told her i wanted to teach in the primary grades
9120289 even though i had volunteered in her classroom she acted as though it would be very strange for me to actually be a teacher at this level
9120290 i really think it has a lot to do with the personality of the teacher
9120291 what matters more than anything is that its a good teacher and the teacher loves to teach
9120292 could you say it would be great if they had this caring male teacher yes but it could be other adults in their lives
9120293 children have their own anxieties about going to school they shouldnt have the burden of the parents anxieties as well
9120294 if the parent is concerned i think that it is something the parent is reacting to from their own life or their own experiences and projecting that onto the child
9120295 a couple of the commenters were put off about my opinion of young male teachers
9120296 i wont apologize for it that was my experience although i admit it was narrow from working in the los angeles county unified school district
9120297 we will keep him hear until he supplies us with a suitable address where he will be living
9120298 with the population exploding and the corrections budget ever smaller prison conditions within the states department of corrections have deteriorated dramatically in recent years there has been no accountability to the taxpayers who fund the system the employees who work in the prisons or the individuals who are incarcerated in them
9120299 given the current political environment surrounding this issue it is clear that an independent agency is needed to properly assess and identify the problems that exist and to begin to create a plan to ensure that those problems are attended to without delay
9120300 utilizing the national institute of corrections will be an essential first step toward ensuring that the prison system in our state functions in a way that is healthy and humane both for the systems employees and its prisoners
9120301 he knew what he was going to do was morally wrong because he was married and also not right because he was in full epd uniform
9120302 det vankerkhove described the kiss as a peck he stated that the kiss was consensual
9120303 det vankerkhove advised officers that after the kiss the girl pumped her fist in the air and said yes det vankerkhove took this to mean that she enjoyed the kiss
9120304 det vankerkhove stated that he was afraid that he was going to get into trouble with his wife for kissing the girl
9120305 he also stated that he did not want to get into trouble with the police department over the incident
9120306 just the other day i met a vietnamese prostitute who was legally named it was with a ph though but really phuck

9120311 in the four films starring kate we are given dream sequences that invite us to imagine how we might fulfil her desires

9120313 sarah palin opposed a statewide ballot initiative to prohibit or restrict new mining operations that could affect salmon in the states streams and rivers
9120314 bush has to much power and the people need to be listened to

9120317 we have a full kitchen in there we have a sink we have a water heater a refrigerator microwave and then we have some seating
9120318 we feel like its an investment in our future we think its an investment in our kids being a part of this something they can grow up with
9120319 if this was in the workplace it would be discrimination and it would be unheard of
9120320 because its a school they think they can somehow get away with it

9120349 im very confident that there will be an absolute clearance for mr peters in a relatively short period of time
9120350 obviously they have to check the information we have given them we gave them copies of entries on the trust statement and they will check them out with the banks
9120351 i believe that eventually justice will triumph and that in this case there will be an absolute clearance and there will hopefully be apologies from all those who have been severely prejudicial and havent look at the facts

9120389 personally level 2 and level 3 sex offenders should never be freed from prison thats my feeling but there are constitutional rights for living in the usa we live by laws and when our counsel tells us the putnam law had too many holes in it like water running through a screen we decided to re think the legislation by making it tougher to stand the test of a high court after being challenged by the american civil liberties union
9120390 putnam county was committed to protect its children from dangerous offenders through a process that is efficient practical and constitutional

9120863 we note that the pastoral forum proposal has been developed without any consultation with those most directly affected in north america
9120864 we would also observe that the various analogies offered for example that we are disaffected children being reunited with our parents or that we are being placed in a holding bay before being restored to our proper province are both demeaning and unacceptable
9120865 we can envision no way in which we could be part of pastoral forum in which either church exercises any leadership role

9120870 from the very beginning we have struggled to understand time matter and the infinite universe who we are where we are headed and if we are alone great minds and some of the genres most legendary writers and directors have now imagined the most wonderful and terrifying answers to these questions
9120871 there is a fifth dimension beyond that which is known to man
9120872 if you want your children to have a sore bottom for a little longer than would be usual from a regular spanking get hold of a muscle rub containing capsicum chili and immediately the spanking is over rub some of this cream or ointment liberally all over the childs buttocks taking care not to get any on the anus in both sexes and the vagina in girls
9120873 the capsicum in the rub will cause its own redness and the child will have a tan on his or her bottom for quite a while and is a very good way of making a punishment seem far more serious without having to spank more and possibly risk bruising
9120874 while i obviously wouldnt recommend it for tots its quite suitable for both boys and girls from six up or so
9120875 if you really want to add to the punishment spank the child and apply the cream immediately before bathtime when the child is bathed the water will react with the cream making their bottom sting almost as bad as being spanked again even very tepid water will feel red hot to the buttocks the child should be made to sit in the water and will probably cry throughout the bathing process it will be so uncomfortable

9120916 a decir del presidente del consejo parroquiano el problema de severiano m ndez hoy instalado con su familia en la capital poblana surgi en un retiro llevado a cabo a mediados de julio dirigido por el presb tero victoriano ram rez quien en pleno serm n pidi orar por los pol ticos que est n pugnando por la ley del aborto y de la eutanasia
9120917 lo que queremos manifestarle es que solamente participaron dos matrimonios de los manifestantes en dicho retiro a nuestro parecer el problema no ha sido lo que argumenta sino que al finalizar el retiro el predicador pidi a los asistentes orar por el partido que est promoviendo el aborto y la eutanasia

9120928 since the 1999 general election they have used every means threat and dirty tactic in the book to ensure they secure the landslide victories this time this by election takes the cake and the prime minister deputy prime minister ministers and other bn leaders have jumped on the bandwagon on a free for all no holds barred smear campaign against me

9120937 so is offshore drilling energy policy or snake oil lets review the facts white house analysts congressional analysts and the oil industry all agree that offshore drilling wont add one drop to our energy pool for at least ten years the way things are going now in another ten years we wont need more oil nobody will be able to afford it

9120979 but according to our definition the solvency margins an insurer was required to bring was far more than that of the mf companies we would welcome the sellers of mutual funds to enter the insurance sector provided they are fully compliant to the insurance model
9120980 one set of complaints being received are what i may call administrative problems where policies are not being received by the policyholders
9120981 some say that their claims have been wrongly projected and some say that their claims are less than what had they expected but in these kinds of issues we must recognize that the insurance companies have also got a right to be heard it is not as if every company is correct and consequently it is because a legal process is there where evidence documents etc are required these types of claim settlements can be considered by the ombudsman

9120983 its fantastic to be able to feel the great energy which is being infused into the new dojo im looking forward to training at castle rock aikido for many years to come
9120984 we teach aikido the way we learned it in japan
9120985 bringing to our program as much authenticity and japanese culture as possible we strive not to americanize the training in any way we want our students to have a truly japanese experience here in colorado this new building helps us achieve that
9120986 first of all aikido is a moderate intensity martial art and can be practiced at any intensity level if youre out of shape and need to practice slowly and lightly at first you can do that here if you are in better shape you can practice more intensely secondly while very much a martial art our program emphasizes self development over self defense our program is about growth not fear it is about thriving not just surviving it is more about defeating our own internal enemies and self limitations more so than imaginary external enemies
9120987 is the honesty and integrity of our operations unlike many other programs in colorado we dont require that students pay thousands of dollars upfront or contractually commit to train for any length of time our philosophy is if our martial arts program is good we shouldnt have to contractually force our students to stay

9120992 hearts will be dangerous they have had a shock with the cup upset and that will make them even more dangerous than usual they will be saying how important it is to bounce back after the defeat and no doubt thats what their manager will be telling the players it will be a hard game on saturday but we are the home side and we will be looking to win the game
9120993 i said to the players before the cup game that we must get back to winning ways i said there would be at least one cup shock and we had to make sure it wasnt us of course hearts and hibs both went out there is no need to be concerned weve had four games so far this season and we have won three and lost one thats a decent start for us i dont think the bubble bursts after one defeat we will take more hits along the way and we just have to be prepared for that and bounce back again quickly

9121015 its a fairly political budget and very much focused on alleviating the hits to incomes from inflation
9121016 lead the rating agencies to have a closer look at their ratings
9121017 you have a much higher fiscal deficit than expected higher borrowing needs and unexpected inflation may not be very good for fixed income holdings of foreign residents so that could put some pressure on the currency
9121018 the government is responsive to the concerns of the people and has taken measures to lighten the burden of all malaysians

9121025 the stable outlook reflects the citys very strong financial position characterized by high fund balance levels and the economic bases strong growth and diversification
9121026 through smart financial practices and proactive decision making the city has remained more than durable during these times of economic uncertainty that have plagued other cities in america
9121027 i am proud to say that city council and i have always kept financial sensibility in mind we do not take the hardworking taxpayers for granted
9121028 shes a conservative lady who has executive experience and i could not be happier with his choice
9121029 he picked a conservative reformer somebody very similar to himself in terms of philosophy im looking forward to meeting her next week
9121030 and i would have some concerns in a nominee that was not but that being said its john mccains pick
9121031 i think that absent a very controversial pick that the entire party is going to be behind whoever we choose
9121032 i told her to turn around and come back weve got this election won
9121033 she proved to be a disaster as a running mate and as a campaigner she was absolutely awful and so i just think that it is very risky for mccain to do this but it may be all he has left
9121034 knows we must aggressively pursue american energy sources like offshore drilling to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
9121035 its a real penny wise and pound foolish move to cut these programs back we know they work to reduce smoking and reductions in smoking lead to reductions in health care
9121036 adult conversation makes it like somebodys talking down to them instead of informing them

9121059 the big thing here is does mccain not feel secure in his feminine wiles and abilities
9121060 you can sense a certain confidence in a woman when they walk into the room mccain clearly states today that no he does not have that at all this could be a problem in november
9121061 i mean other than asking his wife cindy theres no way to answer that question except maybe asking his first wife who was tragically crippled and then well you know divorce happens but mccain was a pow and a man of honor maverick but does he have maverick cooter credentials does he have the feminine mystique or is this going to go down as a feminine mistake
9121062 love his vagina and believe in it love all of it of course if he has a peen instead of a cooter thats going to get a lot more difficult

9121068 tonight was a battle to get back in the running for first place
9121069 we did a good job in getting a lead but unfortunately we let them back in
9121070 we did show our character as we created two or three great chances in the last 10 minutes but we just could not find that tying goal

9121078 ive heard it said by other americans that their idea of paradise would be paris without the french what this fantasy fails to take into account is that paris is the french paris is the product of a centuries long collective endeavor a societys accumulated wisdom on the subject of civilization put into practice it was the french who alerted me to the fact that pleasure is both something to be discovered there for the taking and something to be cultivated through my own efforts its pursuit as it turns out is not a mindless slide into debauchery but a science rigorous and exacting discriminating between the merely good and the sublime the thing about pleasure is that it immerses you in the moment there is no better cure for heartache

9121130 not enough production not enough two out hits thats a big part of it

9121169 what appears in the pictures was the subjects decision not mine i took what they presented delicate moments unadorned and unglamorous yet tender and exquisite
9121170 the photograph of the double image is from the series entitled couplets and predates the single image by a number of years both pictures were made at beaches along the new jersey coast the couplet at atlantic city the single frame at cape may with both my camera was an olympus half frame a small amateurish piece of equipment that let me move about freely the choice of the camera was essential to the development of the series

9121182 i am compelled as a writer anxious not to put forth the views of this party or that party but to arrive at the truth to say there cannot be a greater delusion than to associate the magyar element in hungary with civilisation a count szechenyi was the exception and not the rule

9121239 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
9121240 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
9121241 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
9121242 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
9121243 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome

9121246 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
9121247 the study helps the world know why he is like he is it validates what he knows about himself and what we know about him when he cant follow directions its not because hes stupid

9121286 the graphic story of 55dsls fall winter 08 collection was inspired by hi fidelity stereo equipment and twisted references to the late 80s quirky audiocassette graphics as well as old lp covers are corrupted with our usual irreverence besides the main theme we still havent freed ourselves from our habitual obsession with dynamic and abstract geometric graphics sometimes softened up by mimicking a hand drawn style

9121312 india is ready to review 1950 friendship treaty among others
9121313 the 1950 friendship treaty if ever reviewed or replaced by another treaty it would have far reaching consequences among the nepalese both in nepal and india
9121314 the maoists are essentially anti india and they view the 1950 indo nepal friendship treaty as biased while offering concessions and an open border between india and nepal the treaty also essentially closes all other border for nepal its intention was to make nepal into another of bhutan india must now treat nepal as an equal and while closing all borders will be better for both the nations nepal must be free to chart her own destiny without having to take india into confidence i think the nepalese prime minister understands that and that he will try to set out his quest for the prachandapath by replacing the 1950 friendship treaty by another treaty

9121334 agassi got to work convincing the israeli government in 2007 first he peres and israeli prime minister ehud olmert pressed legislators to change the tax code to make electric vehicles more attractive to consumers under the proposed tax scheme israels 78 percent tax on cars would be replaced by a 10 percent tax on zero emission vehicles and a 72 percent tax on traditional gas guzzlers after four years the sales tax on electric vehicles will rise sharply agassi argued that the revenue losses calculated at 700 million over five years would be insignificant compared to what foreign oil costs the economy
9121335 once agassi had 200 million to fund the grid and a government serious about tax breaks
9121336 the initial deal with israel was thanks to agassis connections practically foreordained
9121337 the real test would be signing up a second country a
9121338 granoff and agassi jump into a hybrid lexus suv and head to capitol hill for a series of meetings
9121339 in the office of a new york house democrat named steve israel agassi settles into a leather couch and makes a direct pitch
9121340 will transfer 2 trillion to 3 trillion out of the economy the amount america will spend on foreign oil in his first term
9121341 there are other ways to conquer america agassi has already been contacted by the mayor of los angeles and politicians in michigan and new york city san francisco mayor gavin newsom was in agassis young global leaders class
9121342 while i enjoy the optimism for new technology and i think that electric cars sound kind of cool i would hardly say that there are significant market forces behind agassis allegedly
9121343 where does he think all those greenbacks eventually end up they have no where to go but back into the american economy
9121344 f ighting against market forces is the equivalent of fighting against the commandments
9121345 sterling i want to know where you place the market or market forces what ever you are comfortable referring to your obsession as
9121346 could you effectively argue sterling vs sterling that the idea of a trade deficit is not ridiculous
9121347 is there anyone that you can think of that could disagree with you on the issue of trade deficits and you would listen and consider changing your mind perhaps friedman bernanke or a tenured economist
9121348 do you believe fighting against market forces is the equivalent of fighting against the commandments
9121349 every major site and tv network is live streaming it online in full but the most awesome i have probably never used that word in seven years of this site online video feed is on the official democratic convention site on demconvention com it is in hd and uses move networks plugin and microsoft silverlight you have to watch it to see the potential of hd video online certainly shows how great hd video can look online

9121352 an old friend of odysseus to whom the king had entrusted his whole household when he sailed with orders to keep everything intact
9121353 regulated the whole course of the life of telemachus in order to raise him to the highest pitch of glory
9121354 if any man in action shall presume to skulk hide himself or retreat from the enemy without orders from his commander he will be instantly shot down as an example of cowardice
9121355 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
9121356 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
9121357 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
9121358 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
9121359 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
9121360 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
9121361 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
9121362 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
9121363 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
9121364 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images

9121375 all government records concerning the assassination of president john f kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate disclosure
9121376 and all records should be eventually disclosed to enable the public to become fully informed about the history surrounding the assassination
9121377 is the best example in existence of a successful targeted declassification effort
9121378 every agency had to search every file system for records relating to the jfk assassination nothing in the statute excludes operational files furthermore the board guidelines are clear that files like the joannides file are a part of the assassination record so the cia is legally bound to search those files and to report on what they found even if the documents arent released
9121379 we expect to receive a response from the cia in the near future
9121380 we have tried to get him to talk about the ring and his files but he has refused
9121381 i cant discuss what is probably a private matter and may or may not involve the museum
9121382 there are legal issues and the museum cant be involved its an attorney client privilege issue
9121383 i think well probably work out something with them i dont know i hope we do
9121384 theres nothing there that establishes anyone giving it to him
9121385 but only if he claims he owns it and i dont think that he does though i dont know that he doesnt we could file a lawsuit get a judicial determination of ownership but thats very time consuming and nobody really wants to do it if you dont have to
9121386 but theyve got to be satisfied that they are getting it from somebody who can legally give it to them
9121387 this was the day the chronic failure was going to demonstrate that he could succeed at something that he was a man and did not deserve contempt
9121388 of course if i had known what was going to happen
9121389 i would have agreed without further thought perhaps he staked everything on a card that is if i agreed to his proposal to go with him to dallas he would not do what he had planned and if i did not then he would
9121390 too small even for his little finger and could not have been his
9121391 if somebody has it let them have it i dont care
9121392 as a recipient of a year scholarship from inwent germany for international long term training on social security it was very exciting to attend a course at the maastricht graduate school of governance interesting and exciting because i along with ten colleagues from indonesia and vietnam were able to learn the uniqueness of this school in depth before coming to maastricht i attended similar courses at the greifswald university and the fachhochschule deutsche rot kreuz in germany after maastricht i will again come back to germany to attend the similar course in heidelberg university the maastricht graduate school of governance mgsog which is situated in a small but tidy city of maastricht was our host for the pension and actuarial theory of social security course from my point of view at glance mgsog has an open minded campus community students lecturers and administrative employees speak very friendly with excellent english i did not find any obstacle to communicate with all its people i experienced the same condition at the university guesthouse where i spent my nice afternoons and nights with people from all over the world although is better known for its famous medicine faculty in indonesia i think the mgsog is also of a world class school its large and modern library provides access to up to date and high quality journals and literatures almost every week students could attend seminars or workshops with world caliber speakers students come from almost all over the world america africa asia europe within the education process students particularly those taking a masters and phd programmes are actively involved in teaching i am sure that the graduates of mgsog will have high quality knowledge and will be able to compete in the labour market from my point of view the most interesting method of teaching developed is pbl problem based learning as a part time lecturer in several indonesian universities i really want to apply the pbl learning method after coming back to jakarta
9121393 all of a sudden its the democrats who rejected a woman for the ticket and the republicans who added a woman to the ticket so all of a sudden its back to the drawing board
9121394 this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9121395 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all

9121397 i had promised todd a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver
9121398 she knows daycare issues she has a disabled child she knows healthcare issues shes a very good choice
9121399 the situation has still not really completely normalised and what you have seen is the effects of it start to seep through to all different sectors of the economy clearly the financial system is fundamental to the functioning of the market economy and as funds drying up have had an impact on firms there has also been a very great impact on consumers

9121406 a greek yogurt is much thicker than regular yogurt because a lot of the liquid whey is strained out it doesnt need the pectin or other thickeners found in many yogurts greek yogurt is higher in protein than regular yogurt with 8 ounces of the nonfat version supplying about 20 grams of protein nearly double the protein content of traditional yogurt its also lower in carbohydrates which means even less lactose for lactose intolerant people do note however that greek yogurt is substantially lower in calcium than regular varieties about 150 milligrams mg of calcium per 8 ounces versus the 300 to 450 mg in plain regular yogurt some brands may contain more so be sure to check the nutrition facts label one more caution fat and calories are also more concentrated particularly in full fat varieties eight ounces of nonfat greek yogurt contain about 125 calories similar to regular nonfat plain yogurt but the same portion of the whole milk version contains about 300 calories and more than 20 grams of fat fortunately the characteristic thick creaminess of greek yogurt is present even in the nonfat form while greek yogurt is traditionally unsweetened some flavored versions are now appearing in the u s

9121668 aku tidak minta cinta harta atau pengakuan tapi aku butuh kasih sayang dan perhatian
9121669 kau titipkan satu kisah kelammu dan percayakan aku menyimpan rahasiamu aku pun ingin menitipkan kisah kelamku agar kau menyimpan rahasiaku juga
9121670 kalau di kelas anggap aku gurumu tapi di luar itu tidak ada guru dan murid adanya aku dan kamu

9121674 dalam berpacaran gt si laki laki yang berperan sebagai syetan atau mungkin gt sebaliknya si wanita yang menjadi syetan
9121675 hai orang orang yang beriman masuklah kamu ke dalam islam secara k ffah keseluruhan dan janganlah kamu turuti langkah langkah syetan sesungguhnya syetan itu musuh yang nyata bagimu
9121676 sungguh telah ada pada diri rasulullah itu suri teladan yang baik
9121677 dan tidaklah patut bagi laki laki yang mukmin dan tidak pula bagi perempuan yang mukminah apabila allah dan rasul nya telah menetapkan suatu ketetapan hukum akan ada bagi mereka pilihan hukum lain tentang urusan mereka
9121678 katakanlah kepada lelaki lelaki beriman agar mereka menundukkan sebagian pandangan dan menjaga kemaluan itulah yang lebih bersih untuk mereka
9121679 dan janganlah kamu dekati zina sesungguhnya zina itu perbuatan yang keji
9121680 allah telah menentukan bagi anak adam bagiannya dari zina yang pasti dia lakukan zinanya mata adalah melihat dengan syahwat zinanya lidah adalah mengucapkan dengan syahwat zinanya hati adalah mengharap dan menginginkan pemenuhan nafsu syahwat kemudian kemaluan yang membenarkan atau menolak itu semua

9121685 karena rahmat dari allah lah kamu bersikap lemah lembut terhadap mereka sekiranya kamu bersikap keras dan berhati kasar niscaya mereka menjauhi kamu
9121686 dan ketika rasulullah tidur ummu sulaim mengusap keringat dan mengkeramasi rambut kepala beliau dengan memasukkan rambut itu ke dalam sebuah bejana dan mencampurnya dengan minyak wangi
9121687 sungguh rasulullah saw pernah mengunjungi ummu haram binti milhan wanita tersebut menjamu makan rasulullah dan menyisir rambut kepala beliau
9121688 kemudian aku abu musa r a menemui seorang wanita dari kaumku untuk kumintai bantuannya menyisir rambut kepalaku dan membersihkannya
9121689 apa yang tidak disinggung nya adalah tergolong dalam hal hal yang dibolehkan nya

9121692 tidak ada yang kuperhitungkan lebih menjelaskan tentang dosa dosa kecil daripada hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh abu hurairah bahwa rasulullah saw bersabda allah telah menentukan bagi anak adam bagiannya dari zina yang pasti dia lakukan zinanya mata adalah melihat dengan syahwat zinanya lidah adalah mengucapkan dengan syahwat zinanya hati adalah mengharap dan menginginkan pemenuhan nafsu syahwat
9121693 kami melihat beberapa perintah dalam yang seharusnya dikerjakan tapi tak dikerjakan maka untuk itu kami hendak menemui amirul mukminin

9121698 jika kamu meninggalkan dosa dosa besar yang kamu dilarang memperbuatnya niscaya kami akan mengampuni kesalahanmu yang kecil kecil dan akan kami masukkan kamu ke dalam tempat yang mulia

9121704 memahami posisiku dan bukannya malah menyudutkanku dengan mengatakan bahwa aku dan x pacaran
9121705 anda mengetahui apa yang harus dilakukan atau anda tidak perlu menyelidiki lebih jauh untuk mendapatkan penjelasan
9121706 tetapi tidak absah bila orang memandang contohnya kita yakin bahwa
9121707 ada pula hadits shahih yang tampaknya jelas jelas menunjukkan kehalalannya
9121708 bila terawasi yaitu dalam keadaan yang manakala terlihat tanda tanda zina yang kecil sekalipun akan ada orang lain yang menaruh perhatian dan cenderung mencegah perbuatan ini
9121709 bahkan hidup bersama tanpa nikah pun bisa disebut pacaran tetapi bukan pacaran islami
9121710 bayangkan seorang guru cerita ke muridnya tentang suatu masalah pribadi yang teman2 dan orang terdekatnya pun tidak tahu
9121711 aku jadi merasa dibutuhkan pak arjuna krn dia sering curhat padaku apa pun masalahnya
9121712 kami semakin terlihat akrab sampai tetangga wati menyangka kami suami istri
9121713 aku tidak ingin dia merasa bersalah jika tahu aku mati bunuh diri
9121714 tapi aku tetap setia tidak mencari pacar walau aku tahu aku bisa
9121715 aku sebulan sekali ke kotanya menemuinya di sela2 kelelahan kerjaku dan kepenatan hati
9121716 aku setia di sini 3 tahun dengan segenap ketegaran dalam keletihan tiga tahun kukorbankan segalanya
9121717 aku akan tanggung semua aib ini biar demi mbak eka dan dua anaknya
9121718 sungguh aku tidak ingin lagi dinikahi walau mungkin pak arjuna mau
9121719 wah siang siang begini sudah datang apa nggak punya kesibukan nak robert
9121720 wah aku benar benar lupa untung kau datang lebih cepat bu bu kami mau ke rumah sakit mau membesuk pamannya robert ini
9121721 saat mbak eka cuti pulang seminggu baru aku sadar aku hanya bayang2
9121722 bahkan ada muridnya yang sampai datang ke rumahnya menemui mbak eka bilang mencintai pak arjuna mbak eka mengadu habis2an pdku tanpa dia tahu aku pun menangis menjerit di sini di dalam hati
9121723 aku dendam banget aku setia di sini 3 tahun dengan segenap ketegaran dalam keletihan eh dia malah belum sembuh2 main cewek
9121724 tiga tahun aku terjerumus tanpa tahu pada siapa harus bertanya dan mengadu
9121725 dan kau pun muncul di kamar kosku sore itu dengan senyum manis yang segera mendorongku berbuat keji
9121726 aku tak berdaya menghadapi janjinya mengulur waktu dan ketidak siapannya entah berapa kali aku hampir bunuh diri dan gila
9121727 dia tetap akan melangkah di sisiku menemaniku dan tidak akan meninggalkanku pak arjuna bilang dia menyayangiku tapi belum bisa beri cinta apalagi harta karena dia tidak ingin memberiku harapan muluk untuk menikahi aku
9121728 pak arjuna bilang tidak mencintai keduanya sebelum nikah mbak eka menyerahkan tubuhnya pada pak arjuna lalu menikahlah mereka pak arjuna pun menikahi mbak dwi yang juga dia hamili sebelum dinikahi
9121729 kami melakukannya suka sama suka atas dasar cinta kami tidak munafik seks itu kebutuhan biologis kami
9121730 lewat tlp ke hpku mbak eka bilang jika aku nekat datang dan dia nekat mempertemukan kami bertiga pak arjuna akan pergi dari rumah itu dan tidak akan kembali untuk selamanya
9121731 sepertinya kau masih marah padaku mila bukankah aku sudah minta maaf lagipula masalah itu sudah dimakan waktu cobalah kita melupakannya hari esok masih panjang dan kita tidak bisa terus menerus seperti ini
9121732 ya seperti dua pihak yang saling tidak kenal satu sama lain aku di kutub utara dan kau di kutub selatan padahal sebenarnya yang terjadi kita saling membutuhkan saling merindukan dan keinginan kita adalah bersatu jangan kau pungkiri itu
9121733 lulus sekolah aku sudah lupa dengan cita2 dan harapan ortu aku malas ngelanjutin kuliah
9121734 mas kau memang anggur yang menggiurkan tetapi yang kubutuhkan adalah pisang
9121735 dik ayu i love you dik ayu i love you
9121736 bila kita mustahil dapat menjadi pasangan suami istri setidak tidaknya kita bisa menjadi pasangan pejuang di jalan dakwah
9121737 jangan makan ini bisa kepedasan dan sakit perut kau nanti
9121738 bahwa pacaran yang saya jalani akan aman karena tujuan kami baik
9121739 dari depan dan dari belakang dari kanan dan dari kiri
9121740 setiap individu dan masyarakat harus berjuang untuk memperoleh bagiannya di dalam kehidupan yang indah dan berlimpah limpah ini menikmati segala sesuatu yang baik dihalalkan bagi semua lelaki dan perempuan

9121751 bagaimana pendapat kalian kalau kalian mempunyai kambing yang digembala menuju dua lembah yang satu banyak rumputnya yang lainnya gersang bukankah jika kambing itu digembalakan di padang yang subur itu juga berada di bawah kudrat allah
9121752 orang yang memiliki sifat khasyyah lebih suka berlindung kepada ilmu
9121753 sesungguhnya kita milik allah dan kepada nya pasti kita kembali
9121754 emangnya burung elo milik siapa milik allah mau pakai minta ijin dulu dong ama pemiliknya
9121755 hr bukhari amp muslim enak kan dosa kita berkurang enak kan siksa kubur dan neraka kita menyusut
9121756 seorang putri saya di zaman jahiliyah dikubur hidup hidup lalu aku mengeluarkannya sebelum dia meninggal dunia dia masih mendapatkan masa islam ketika dia masuk islam dia terkena salah satu hukuman had karena berzina lalu dia mencoba bunuh diri dengan melukai nadinya kemudian aku menjumpainya sementara dia sudah memotong sebagian nadi lehernya lalu aku mengobatinya sampai sembuh kemudian dia pun bertobat dengan baik setelah itu dia minta dicarikan jodoh wahai amirul mukminin apakah aku harus memberitahu calonnya tentang keadaan putriku pada masa lalu
9121757 kamu ingin menyingkapkan apa yang ditutupi allah demi allah jika kamu memberitahukan tentang keadaannya kepada seseorang kami akan menjadikan kamu contoh hukuman lantaran membuka aib bagi penduduk negeri nikahkanlah dia dengan pernikahan yang suci
9121758 she is an executive shes a reformer shes dynamic shes strong pawlenty said
9121759 more importantly shes going to be a great leader for our country and already is a great leader for our country
9121760 i congratulated him on the pick and told him i was very excited about the pick
9121761 never got into this with the idea that i needed or wanted something out of it im
9121762 i think they are going to take a good look at her he said
9121763 i am disappointed i thought he pawlenty would be a very good choice
9121764 hes certainly a great republican candidate maybe the time isnt right maybe next time
9121765 i went to bed last night thinking it was governor pawlenty
9121766 i am going to do all i can to continue to be among the strongest supporters in the country for senator mccain and his new running mate he said
9121767 im very happy today to spend my birthday with you and to make a historic announcement in dayton
9121768 i dont think the obama campaign can take minnesota for granted
9121769 but with a reasonable investment of campaign resources in the state he will win
9121770 a lot of our families are in an economic crisis
9121771 our jobs are going away and its getting harder for families to meet their basic needs
9121772 a lot of us think this is the most important election of our lifetime
9121773 ive never seen anything like it weve got people begging to volunteer
9121774 i predict well have a record voter turnout and most of the new voters will be young people
9121775 will be very good for our legislative and congressional candidates
9121776 i think what the blogs are going to be able to do is give an inside perspective of what its like to be in inside the convention
9121777 i think that was our big draw the last time youre there and get a chance to interact with senators and congressmen and various people there within the party i think the rnc is going to be very good about bringing those people by the blogger area
9121778 things that are more interesting to us are going to the parties and hearing people say things about various chairmen or frontrunners that they would not want to be reported 15 minutes later
9121779 i think its very important to constantly be reaching out to a new audience
9121780 you know that so many people particularly younger people are getting their news and information online
9121781 most of us do not have time to read thousands of blogs so my question is how will we collectively be able to sift through all of this
9121782 but nevertheless getting other views on the process is valuable and in essence i applaud it but how will you be able to tell between something that is credible and something that is either biased or something that is frankly disinformation that i dont know
9121783 twitter gives me the ability to follow the convention goers to see what is going on and where the best celebrity sightings and parties are at
9121784 i plan to tell people where im at and what is going on and expect the same in return i think this is great for downtown st paul businesses and as a resident i plan to partake
9121785 it is significant to start the season off 1 0 as opposed to 0 1
9121786 is it important sure but i think it has to do a lot with your football team
9121787 when i was a senior at illinois we lost our first game then we won 10 in a row and went to the rose bowl
9121788 sometimes theres a little bit of a wakeup there but i dont think we look at this situation as like that
9121789 i want our kids to be able to celebrate after a game
9121790 i want our kids to be able to go in the locker room and sing the rouser i want our kids to understand that some of the greatest moments ive ever had in sports were on a plane ride home after a win on the road i want our kids to experience those things
9121791 i think the first game is extremely important i feel that each game that you win you get better coach preaches getting better each game and each day so why not start off with a win and continue to get better the first game sets the tone it just shows what new things we have to offer it will also display some of the new talent that we have coming in
9121792 their offense i think weve got a good feel for and special teams weve got a little bit of a feel
9121793 i think the thing that concerns me the most is the unknowns of the personnel on the defensive side of the ball its a game where we come in as the underdog its certainly a big school for where we want to take our program playing big ten schools is a good thing
9121794 for the next year and a half all i heard about was barb
9121795 todd was the most honest and fair person i think i ever met
9121796 even though they were lutherans they were fun to be with
9121797 freshman 15 would love nothing more than to get a little jump start during orientation week
9121798 jurusan jawa tengah dan jawa timur sudah terjual semua namun untuk jurusan cirebon dan bandung masih banyak

9121801 you never know how extensive and wonderful your community is until you get involved
9121802 we think of this less as a pageant and more about service and achievement which is what rotary is all about
9121803 with all the negative things you read this is so refreshing to see all these high achieving young women
9121804 and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves
9121805 i believe this community has illustrated to us not the least of which was in four surveys that it is time to provide the community opportunity to make a decision the reality is that this has been requested of us the park district moves at the will of the people of this community and it is time to ask them what they want
9121806 we are on the home stretch charlotte is just glad to be away from the hospital and once she has had her stitches removed she will be on the next flight home
9121807 she regressed terribly after last weeks operation and seemed to be confusing dreams with reality as she slept for about 20 hours a day
9121808 but well have to pay for the flights from crete with the funds we have raised because the insurance company wont pay up
9121809 it was a struggle getting into atlas and then i ended up sat by the door at the front because of the poor facilities if they had just got a portable ramp it could have been easily solved but they shouldnt get away with doing absolutely nothing
9121810 its annoying and humiliating when people are always having to help and ask if youre okay thats not the point of a night out disabled people should have access to all services on the same equal footing
9121811 we are delighted that mr fogerty won his case this is a significant sum for a small claims court
9121812 where premises have a physical feature that makes it impossible for a disabled person to use them reasonable adjustments have to be made disabled people should enjoy the freedom to use facilities and services it is shocking that in this day and age disabled people are still being humiliated like this
9121813 atlas bar has co operated in every way since we became aware of mr fogertys experience
9121814 having two members of my own family disabled this is a matter which is close to my heart
9121815 the police should have backed off after about 20 minutes the plane could have tailed him and he would still be here today
9121816 we dont know why he took the chase he had paid 4 000 for the bike and had it 12 months just a week before this happened he spent 600 having it repaired
9121817 we wanted 40p but we realised that fuel is coming down
9121818 drivers have been losing around 40 per week it has been very hard to be a taxi driver during the fuel crisis
9121819 it will be temporary as all the indications are fuel prices are falling the council thought 20p was not unreasonable in the circumstances
9121820 we havent yet made a decision on whether this is something that we are going to do
9121821 manchester united is unique in where it is and the trade it generates the fees we charge for that will reflect the uniqueness of it but we are keen to work with all traders to find an acceptable way forward
9121822 people living locally will become so disheartened if this carries on it amazes me that the highways agency can be so inefficient
9121823 all this delay makes it very hard for tameside businesses using that route to make plans for the future
9121824 leigh had so much courage and strength she was an inspiration to me and to others
9121825 leigh is still very much a part of our family and always a treasured daughter sister and auntie everyone is so proud of her
9121826 i used to take a shortcut across a yard in failsworth on my way to primary school
9121827 i know that men working there cut asbestos sheets and handled asbestos materials in the yard but i had no idea that by walking through the yard i could have inadvertently got cancer
9121828 for a long time it has been the forgotten cancer the silent epidemic leighs case shows it cannot be seen as an old persons disease any longer
9121829 for somebody so young to die with all her dreams and ambitions seems so unjust
9121830 there is a big issue about asbestos in schools built in the post war period
9121831 when doors are slammed by young children or chairs are pushed against pipes it can disturb the asbestos this may have happened to leigh
9121832 the government has been scared of facing up to it because they dont want to create panic but we know for a fact there is still asbestos in schools and we need to identify who could be at risk
9121833 none of mr todds personal friends will be called to give evidence
9121834 its quite incredible to have these items back after so long we are all absolutely delighted because they mean so much to the church
9121835 one gentleman had tears in his eyes when he saw the chalice and plates again after all these years
9121836 mcmahon came to him with both arms swinging to try to land a punch mr macdonald had to take hold of him and it ended up in a scuffle
9121837 he has no recollection and is aghast at what has taken place
9121838 its no wonder the kids are as unruly as they are today if the teachers are setting this kind of impression
9121839 im at the top of my division now and my aim is to be the best in the world there are clubs springing up around manchester and my message to other fighters is come and take it off me
9121840 its a chess game a real mental fight and physical challenge people dedicate their lives to boxing wrestling or martial arts but we have to put them all together
9121841 you get bumps and bruises and ive dislocated a toe but other than that its immensely fun
9121842 some people dont understand why women do it but it helps you learn exactly how you would handle yourself if you were attacked some self defence programmes prey on womens fear this is the real thing
9121843 dan persembahkanlah yang terindah bagi sahabatmu jika dia harus tahu musim surutmu biarlah dia mengenali pula musim pasangmu gerangan apa sahabat itu jika kau sentiasa mencarinya untuk sekadar bersama dalam membunuh waktu carilah ia untuk bersama menghidupkan sang waktu kerana dialah yang bisa mengisi kekuranganmu bukan mengisi kekosonganmu dan dalam manisnya persahabatan biarkanlah ada tawa ria dan berkongsi kegembiraan kerana dalam titisan kecil embun pagi hati manusia menemui fajar dan ghairah segar kehidupan
9121844 we want our product to be desirable and used by everyone
9121845 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9121846 wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9121847 governor palins success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll up your sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of america
9121848 a working mother with a track record of getting things done
9121849 american has a clear code of conduct with passengers if people are viewing pornography being the best example it is something american is empowering flight attendants to deal with
9121850 there is no way we can take on any additional responsibility here

9121984 if nato suddenly takes military actions against abkhazia and south ossetia acting solely in support of tbilisi this will mean a declaration of war on russia
9121985 tensions between russia and the west were ratcheted even higher today a fter moscow warned that the american naval build up in the black sea could be seen as a declaration of war
9121986 normally battleships do not deliver aid and this is battleship diplomacy this does not make the situation more stable
9121987 despite the apparent strength of the nato naval group in the black sea a single salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or thee missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group within twenty minutes the waters would be clear

9122032 its not about boasting about fasting or looking for recognition the reward comes from god
9122033 we make sure that the younger pupils are up to date with their planners and teach them the basic prayers
9122034 i started fasting for part of ramadan when i was 11 and its easier now i look forward to it i like the activities competitions and recitals although pe can be hard we usually dont do strenuous exercise during ramadan so we dont get dehydrated
9122035 when i first came to the school 11 years ago ramadan was a time when pupil behaviour deteriorated because the pupils were irritable
9122036 but now weve introduced so many activities and competitions and a structure for the prayers theres a buzz around the school we remind them about the purpose of ramadan the prophet said seeking knowledge for one hour is better than praying for 70 years pupils take that on board and behaviour now improves during the month
9122037 parents donate food pupils perform songs and then everyone eats together you can chat and share with parents and then talk through any issues its a lovely atmosphere
9122038 you see the tiredness coming through as the month wears on but you also see the pupils determination
9122039 we fast until 7pm eat together and then gather in the mosque for prayers at 9pm we dont get home until about 11pm and then its up at 5am again it can get difficult and thats why its important to keep in mind why youre doing it and that youre not alone
9122040 everyone respects and recognises the importance of ramadan at the school no matter what their background
9122041 but we also recognise that we live in britain where most people are christian so we celebrate those festivals as well
9122042 at christmas we put up a christmas tree have a pantomime and send cards to each other we also have a christmas dinner with lovely halal turkey
9122043 at first i couldnt fast for the full 30 days of ramadan when i was young but slowly i got better at it when i was 14 i remember wed play hockey tournaments without water but it contributed to mental toughness
9122044 now i look forward to ramadan and the opportunity to reflect on my life
9122045 being a teacher during ramadan is one of the most noble things a muslim can do according to the prophet because imparting knowledge empowers and helps others to become better people ramadan is a fantastic snapshot of what it means to be a teacher

9122072 love is when a girl puts on perfume and a boy puts on shaving cologne and they go out and smell each other
9122073 love is when you go out to eat and give somebody most of your french fries without making them give you any of theirs
9122074 love is when my mommy makes coffee for my daddy and she takes a sip before giving it to him to make sure the taste is ok
9122075 love is when you kiss all the time then when you get tired of kissing you still want to be together and you talk more my mommy and daddy are like that they look gross when they kiss

9122081 my mommy loves me more than anybody you dont see anyone else kissing me to sleep at night
9122082 love is when mommy gives daddy the best piece of chicken
9122083 love is when mommy sees daddy smelly and sweaty and still says he is handsomer than robert redford
9122084 love is when your puppy licks your face even after you left him alone all day
9122085 i know my older sister loves me because she gives me all her old clothes and has to go out and buy new ones
9122086 when you love somebody your eyelashes go up and down and little stars come out of you
9122087 love is when mommy sees daddy on the toilet and she doesnt think its gross
9122088 you really shouldnt say i love you unless you mean it but if you mean it you should say it a lot people forget
9122089 as time goes by i try very hard not to think of sarah in terms of this terrible crime that weve had to deal with here in the court but rather think of her in a place like this this is filmed in at trial the judge declined to exclude the tape under section 352 of the california evidence code the analogue to federal rule of evidence 403 which permits courts to exclude otherwise relevant evidence if the danger of unfair prejudice
9122090 in the event that evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair
9122091 the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment provides a mechanism for relief
9122092 can of course be so inflammatory as to risk a verdict impermissibly based on passion not deliberation
9122093 the quickest way to a persons brain is through his eye
9122094 but even in the movies the quickest way to his heart and feelings is still through the ear
9122095 im just a phone call away whenever you need someone to rant to im still a very good friend and i will continue to be a very good friend
9122096 i am chasing a lot of pitches sometimes you feel good and you want to swing but i am swinging at bad pitches its hard i have to make the adjustment
9122097 one of these times it might catch me and put me out for a while but when i come back im going to be right there pitchers can do whatever they want to do thats just how i hit pitchers might not like it but they have to deal with it because im going to be there
9122098 to go over there and compete and represent our country and come home with the bronze medal obviously we had our eye on the gold but getting in the bronze medal game and winning that was special for us
9122099 whos the hero whos the big star even the famously terrible 62 mets had marv throneberry the nats dont have a character like that night after night the most interesting thing to talk about is that teddy roosevelt didnt win the mascot race again
9122100 he looked like a pretty solid number three guy on a winning ballclub
9122101 i can only tell you that all of a sudden he started having pain
9122102 he was doing fine we were projecting him to come up and pitch here in september and he just had a setback
9122103 luckily he had landed in the roots of a tree
9122104 i just got information message from mumbai that he will participate in the fast and he will also do prayers he is not participating in the prayers amongst us in the temple but he will do the same thing in the hospital
9122105 there has been a great deal of suspicion over the years about what is going on with these plants
9122106 he is a man of the cloth and so a lot of people dont want to think badly of him but frankly if someone has a huge crop of cannabis in their back garden its highly unlikely they are just sitting there admiring its horticultural properties
9122107 by keeping a watch on the plants we can make sure this is the case and put an end to any suspicions over the purpose of these plants once and for all
9122108 demonstrated that he would not get boxed in by convention as he sought to put a woman next in line to the presidency for the first time
9122109 mccain had to protect his reputation as an opponent of status quo washington he had to pick someone with the shortest washington r sum he did that he picked someone the right wing is going to be happy about but its a gamble
9122110 the question is what does it do to the argument that obamas not ready
9122111 hes chosen a washington outsider who will be an ally for him in shaking up the way things are done this is someone with solid conservative credentials but solid credentials as a reformer and its clear after watching todays event no one is going to push sarah palin around not barack obama and not joe biden
9122112 not only can the remotely located patient consult a specialist the specialist too can instruct the patient for specific test procedures and treatment
9122113 children these days have built up strength in video but reading was their weakness and i decided to use their strength to build up their weakness
9122114 results have revealed it to be the fastest reading improvement for children ever recorded in research
9122115 we had a huge response from families with kids saying they love going to school and cant be late because they will miss their reading class
9122116 holy cow im just kind of speechless on the whole thing
9122117 im looking at him right now and i see perfection

9122122 there are clearly going to be serious challenges of providing clean water ensuring that there are no waterborne diseases sanitation needs are taken care of and no epidemic breaks out
9122123 anytime you try to change something in baseball its both emotional and difficult
9122124 i believe that because of the configuration of ballparks both new and old that calling home runs is really much more difficult than it once was
9122125 and therefore and only in those cases should we have replay
9122126 my opposition to unlimited instant replay is still very much in play
9122127 we really dont need to stretch them out so much and that will give the other guys a chance to get some work
9122128 the last week or so ive been driving the ball better its finally getting back to where it was before
9122129 i just want to see the younger guys coming up and the guys right here to sustain the progress they have made
9122130 so when we go during the offseason we can remember the last month or so they played well without having to go back to june or july when they werent doing well
9122131 if i felt i was really hurt and couldnt help the team then it might have been different i think it just ended up being something a little more serious than we thought
9122132 hes running on his heels at times we dont want to all of the sudden blow a knee out or something when hes trying to play with a broken foot
9122133 you know for any pitcher you see three or four runs youre happy with that
9122134 so for me to see three or four or five or six or seven runs its a lot to work with im not gonna allow seven or 10 no no no three or four and i still can get a win
9122135 everybody has been swinging the bat real well and i think thats been the key to our success the last couple games
9122136 what i can say is some guys are getting healthy and were getting some guys back and also some guys whove come back are getting into a rhythm a little bit
9122137 this is obviously something where were not going to be scoring seven runs every single day but it does help and i know these guys are better than they have shown
9122138 hes taking a liking to the job and hes done well overall i still think that he needs to throw a higher percentage of strikes but hes got good stuff and he likes the job weve still got a month to see him and well see where that takes us
9122139 i think hes done a great job especially the first couple of years coming out of the pen to be thrown into the savers role hes got a lot of talent and hes learned a lot and we trust him there hopefully hell be there a long time
9122140 i felt confident out there and i was just trying to throw strikes
9122141 and i was able to get my good slider out there today
9122142 ive been seeing the ball well and having good at bats
9122143 im just now starting to feel comfortable to where i was before
9122144 he looks aggressive like hes smelling blood when hes out there
9122145 he doesnt look as tentative as he was in the beginning of the season
9122146 im not going to go into obviously the details of our negotiations
9122147 we are working together as partners to make certain that we cover the concerns of both parties for sovereignty for the iraqi government
9122148 and so everything that we will do in this agreement will fully respect that sovereignty we will look at how the arrangements will go forward we have a number of agreements around the world this is not unknown to people how to negotiate the status of various forces on the soil of a sovereign ally and so the agreement will be in accordance with those principles
9122149 this issue as you know is also a sensitive issue that deals with sovereignty
9122150 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any sofa or strategic agreement between the united states and any other country in the world
9122151 i think the most important thing other than beating lowe is its been a while since we shook hands in white uniforms
9122152 its been a while since weve won here winning at home and winning a close game too shows a lot
9122153 i guess i was trying to get the ball in too much
9122154 i actually thought he was all over the place in the last two innings
9122155 even when he was getting guys out he was missing his location bad
9122156 its tough because the ball cuts back on the corner
9122157 he backdoors that thing all the time and he knows how to control it you just have to wait him out until you can get a pitch you can drive
9122158 their verdict means that you in a calm and calculated manner poured petrol over her and then deliberately set fire to her intending that she should be caused really serious injury
9122159 this was an unbelievably vicious and cruel thing to have done to another human being no matter what the motivation
9122160 sadly she could not have been more wrong because on the 23 july you made a shocking and chilling decision that would have catastrophic effects and would ruin her life forever
9122161 during the course of the day you contacted her and told her that when you got home you were going to light her up
9122162 when you got home having obviously given the matter very serious thought you set about carrying out your act of revenge
9122163 i cant sleep at night i have flashbacks of gary standing there doing absolutely nothing to help me there are days where i feel so low i want to end my own life
9122164 you know honestly thats probably what i would attribute it to the injuries dont have much in common ryan zimmerman he was sliding austin kearns he had loose bodies in his elbow none of those are conditioning things none of those have to do with training
9122165 if there was something we could identify from a conditioning standpoint we would address that but you look at it there is no overlapping root cause i cant think of things in particular i would advocate doing differently
9122166 the training staff knew right away that i was hurt
9122167 but everybody hurts in baseball nobody feels good so step one is you determining whether youre healthy whether it doesnt hurt enough to say anything everybody appreciates someone who goes out and plays if youre injured but can you be the same player or are you hurting the team
9122168 i cant get in their heads because different guys one guy may tell you im fine and then another might tell you that hey im dead you know youve got to know the player and see it for what its worth youve got to observe him too when hes on the field a lot of it is observation
9122169 but i think it may have affected us more just because of who it bit its the front line guys here who have gotten hurt thats all

9122181 in entertainment games are the equal of the film and television industry and growth is strong but now the japanese game industry isnt leading with the same vigor that it did previously this is a worldwide battle
9122182 to either be affiliated and losing the brand or possibly merging with taito thats the big difference
9122183 while it looks like the games are made by a single talented genius games are made by teams

9122198 this is one of the most promising breakthroughs in the management of high risk pregnancies in more than 30 years
9122199 the active ingredient we used in this study magnesium sulfate is better known as epsom salt
9122200 so what we have learned from this study is that we have a cheap widely available treatment already in hand that cuts in half the risk of babies being born with an extremely disabling disorder that is a tremendously exciting development
9122201 magnesium sulfate or epsom salt can also be used for detoxing the liver and bowel of dietary and metabolic acids take 1 to 2 tablespoons of magnesium sulfate in 1 liter of 9 5 alkaline water and drink the entire solution within 5 to 10 minutes this solution should be ingested first thing upon rising the detoxing of the bowel and liver generally takes place within 60 minutes after ingestion so make sure you are close to a bathroom

9122210 kau bunga yang memilukan pandangan handai taulan yang hadir dan cintaku pada romeo lebih dari bunga yang menawan hati ini dan kukatakan bahwa keindahan bunga hanya bisa bertahan 24 jam esok harinya kau akan layu dan ku campakkan ke laut namun cintaku pada kekasihku romeo dari hari ke hari dari bulan ke bulan dari tahun ke tahun dan seterusnya bahkan sampai pada akhir hayatku cintaku padanya semakin menggebu gebu
9122211 aku tidak punya siapa siapa lagi didunia ini selain dirimu
9122212 aku sangat mencintaimu marie sangat berbahaya bila kau dekat denganku
9122213 aku telah jauh darimu dan hidupku merana dan perjuanganku sampai menguasai afrika utara dan eropa sebagian besar atas dukungan semangat istriku
9122214 agar dapat melukiskan hasratku kekasih taruh bibirmu seperti bintang di langit kata katamu ciuman dalam malam yang hidup dan deras lenganmu memeluk daku seperti suatu nyala bertanda kemenangan mimpiku pun berada dalam benderang dan abadi

9122219 if they cant say it in front of the principal or the counselor it probably doesnt need to be going on
9122220 if we get computer glitches or the lcd screen doesnt work its not a big deal
9122221 the most important thing you have as a teacher is your mind and your creativity when i was in school colored chalk was high tech we can teach without the computers and the lcd screens our biggest priority is to get students in class
9122222 when you get older you start wanting to come home
9122223 my sister is a principal at dickinson and lives in league city this is an opportunity for us to come home and were excited about the possibility
9122224 the forecast path has continued to steadily narrow we have a lot higher confidence that this thing is not going to wobble to the west
9122225 we are anticipating to sell out today as are most of our colleagues
9122226 you need to wear on people especially in our type of run game
9122227 its downhill running power running sometimes those runs in the second half are more effective when you can kind of wear down those guys a little bit were a second half running football team and im sure itll be working this week
9122228 i thought overall they did a nice job and theyre getting better and better
9122229 our offensive line is not as big a concern for us as it is on the outside at least not the starters i like those guys
9122230 obviously he had a couple bad plays but thats what it is a couple plays
9122231 johns played very well we have a lot of confidence in john st clair
9122232 hes gotten better he has to continue to get better but overall hes done a pretty good job
9122233 i dont want to get my hopes up that much
9122234 of course 3 touchdown catches aint bad for a resume but you never know what a team might need
9122235 i think whatever the rotation is everybodys going to see time
9122236 all those guys can make plays i dont know if we have the one standout guy that is our go to guy but i think we have four or five guys that can really have big games week in and week out
9122237 by her being on that berlin heart it saved her life
9122238 i told charles if he felt like coming to practice come to practice but take care of his family and go from there
9122239 were just glad that it seems like its going to have a happy ending
9122240 i think probably the toughest thing that i had to battle with and i still battle with it now is that i knew in order for my daughter to live another kid had to die
9122241 it is best not to swat the flys starting position
9122242 but rather to aim a bit forward of that to anticipate where the fly is going to jump when it first sees your swatter
9122243 my style on stage is how i dress off stage
9122244 its how i dress when im with my friends and just hanging out i like to dress casual
9122245 i think its gonna be really cool im so excited because i saw pictures of the new field and its going to be so so bigger and im excited i cant wait
9122246 its bittersweet i spent my high school years here on the morgantown high field
9122247 when theyre away we come here and then when were away we come and watch them so its kind of a good thing except the mohawk bowl then we wanna win
9122248 whoops now theres a problem since we didnt get at amp ts approval
9122249 just the place for a snark i have said it twice
9122250 the appointing authority may dismiss a permanent employee for just cause only
9122251 just the place for a snark i have said it twice
9122252 once our teens have experienced years of fun and games all you can eat no responsibility free from parents amusement then we have helped train their appetities to find more alluring fulfillment in the adult world

9122256 een taal is gemaakt om te communiceren niet om te discrimineren
9122257 ik laat mijn wagen niet graag achter zelfs niet voor enkele minuten maar los daarvan het is hier best leuk
9122258 ik kom uit vilvoorde en ben de zoon van een portugese vader en een spaanse moeder een migrantenkind dus misschien net daarom klikt het in anderlecht zo goed met mijn leerlingen na de middelbare school ben ik romaanse talen gaan studeren aan de vub na mijn studie heb ik even les gegeven in het atheneum van vilvoorde waar ik zelf naar school ben geweest maar dat was ik gauw beu vilvoorde is mijn stad niet meer veel te gesloten ik heb het klimaat daar zo zien verzuren en dat merk je ook onder de jeugd maar wat wil je als er bijna niets is voor die jeugd
9122259 we zijn een kleine brave school maar uiteraard heerst er wel een anderstalige cultuur en voor een nederlandstalige school is dat niet makkelijk de meeste leerlingen kiezen dan ook om economische redenen noem het gerust opportunisme voor het nederlandstalig onderwijs vlaanderen heeft een goed draaiende economie en de leerlingen beseffen maar al te goed dat ze niet aan de bak geraken als ze niet meertalig zijn en het franstalig onderwijs levert niet dezelfde kwaliteit zo gaat dat in brussel
9122260 mijn leerlingen vragen zich dan ook vaak af hoe ik in godsnaam voor de klas kan staan ik ben niet groot spreek beter frans dan zij maar dan toch in een nederlandstalige school het moet wel gezegd ik kan tegen een stootje en vat grapjes van mijn leerlingen meestal sportief op om er dan een speels antwoord op te geven iedere leerkracht heeft natuurlijk zijn stijl maar als je dat niet kan dan kun je denk ik niet in onze school terecht er heerst een heel andere mentaliteit in brussel
9122261 veel van mijn leerlingen hoofdzakelijk migrantenkinderen hebben een talencomplex ze zijn bang om nederlands te spreken en bij uitbreiding om het te leren dus gaan ze zich er wat tegen afzetten bovendien heeft het nederlands geen goede reputatie bij die groep jongeren omdat vlaanderen als racistisch wordt bestempeld dan zeg ik altijd vraag je eens af waarom ik dan wel nederlands kan en ja er zijn weinig vlamingen in onze school en als ze er zijn dan worden ze door de meerderheid in de klas getest dat geeft soms conflicten
9122262 een taal is gemaakt om te communiceren niet om te discrimineren walloni is rijkelijk laat wakker geschud dat weet iedereen maar nu wordt het taalonderwijs sterk opgewaardeerd vaak volgen kinderen hier les volgens het taalbadsysteem ze krijgen dan sommige vakken in het nederlands dat is een uitstekende manier om de taal te leren in vlaanderen bestaat de omgekeerde tendens daar lijkt het alsof kennis van het frans niet meer nodig is de perceptie over walloni is ook ronduit negatief mijn vrienden verklaarden me gek toen ik hier kwam wonen maar zoals je ziet zo slecht is het hier nog niet charleroi heeft grote problemen gehad en heeft nog altijd problemen maar de stad kruipt uit het dal de bevolking was de schandalen en de slechte naam overigens ook kotsbeu
9122263 als leerkracht moet je tegenwoordig heel wat zijn vriendelijk begrijpend tolerant communicatief grappig altijd het beste van jezelf geven noem maar op aan het einde van het schooljaar ben ik afgepeigerd maar liever dat dan terug naar vroeger toen de leerkracht zich alleen met zijn leerstof bezighield dat betekent natuurlijk niet dat ik niet streng ben al noem ik het liever strikt in de zin van je hebt een nul en dat blijft een nul je had maar moeten studeren en toch word ik gerespecteerd
9122264 im not going to go into obviously the details of our negotiations
9122265 we are working together as partners to make certain that we cover the concerns of both parties for sovereignty for the iraqi government
9122266 and so everything that we will do in this agreement will fully respect that sovereignty we will look at how the arrangements will go forward we have a number of agreements around the world this is not unknown to people how to negotiate the status of various forces on the soil of a sovereign ally and so the agreement will be in accordance with those principles
9122267 maybe he thought that he didnt make as much of his life as he should have or have as much material things as other successful people have
9122268 but one of the reasons he didnt have all that was because of what he did for other people in his life
9122269 he cared more about his grandkids than anything else in the world
9122270 die mensen hebben nu kunnen constateren dat die afstand best meevalt en dat er weinig files in het noorden zijn dat is de manier om het grootste imagoprobleem van het noorden dat randstedelingen het noorden altijd ver weg vinden de wereld uit te helpen
9122271 als je successen niet herhaalt dan ebt het effect zo weg
9122272 de volgende tentoonstelling is minstens zo interessant maar minder bekend
9122273 we hebben fantastisch samengewerkt met het groninger museum daar is het ook nog niet helemaal voorbij de expositie van moderne chinese kunst duurt nog tot november
9122274 the golden nugget is thrilled to host the fifth season of nbcs exciting late night poker program poker after dark the golden nugget has been home to several big poker productions as well as hosted many poker tournaments and events so bringing a top rated program like poker after dark to the property just seemed like a natural fit
9122275 i cant wait for the latent misogyny of some on the left to come out in full force towards her between now and november
9122276 shortly after 8 30 p m the train doors failed to open on arrival at waverley and passengers were unable to get off
9122277 a cleaner attended at the conductors cab and observed gracie was asleep he was unable to be awoken and the emergency release was activated to allow access to the cab
9122278 das liberale forum konnte nicht von vornherein auf eine feste struktur mit steten mitteln zur ckgreifen das hat nat rlich eine l ngere anlaufzeit
9122279 wir pr sentieren uns unsere kandidaten vor allem auf der stra e und versuchen mit den menschen in diesem land ins pers nliche gespr ch zu kommen
9122280 this is the law that would make it at the supreme court if planned parenthood assaults this law in south dakota we are ready there is money being raised for the legal costs to fight this all the way
9122281 one of our co chairs is a republican and the other is democrat
9122282 it is reasonable to expect it to win on the ballot
9122283 the court challenges by planned parenthood will likely begin sometime that november and would reach the
9122284 the u s supreme court will most likely have the best make up for an abortion bill when the case reaches the supreme court in 2011 or 2012 than any court is likely to have in the next ten or fifteen years
9122285 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
9122286 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
9122287 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
9122288 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
9122289 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
9122290 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
9122291 for the month of july the lynx light rail line tallied a ridership count of 16 thousand 900 transit chief keith parker says if they see another 5 percent growth or so in the next couple months they will have reached their ridership projections for the year 2025
9122292 we know there were a lot of us advisers in georgia but instructors teachers and personnel for military weapons should be on firing ranges and in the teaching centers but where were they they were in the zone of military operations
9122293 and that pushes one to the conclusion that the leadership of the united states knew about the action that was being prepared and moreover probably took part in it
9122294 if the leadership of the united states had sanctioned that then i have the suspicion that it was done specially to organise a small victorious war
9122295 and if it didnt work then to create from russia the appearance of an enemy and on that ground unite the electorate around one presidential candidate of course the ruling party
9122296 in a significant way the crisis was provoked including by our american friends in the course of the election struggle
9122297 this was the use of administrative resources in a deplorable way to provide advantage to one of the candidates in the current case from the ruling party
9122298 if european states want to serve the foreign policy interests of the usa then in my opinion they will gain nothing from this
9122299 a country in the current case russia which can stand up for the honor and dignity of its citizens defend their lives will not be isolated despite the bloc like thinking of our partners in europe or in the united states
9122300 the world doesnt end with europe or the united states
9122301 but i think any kind of reaction they would take to the eu would be in kind like visa restrictions or a business contacts freeze
9122302 i dont think the retaliation would include the kind of things like restricting oil
9122303 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9122304 governor palin is a very bright leader who will bring a fresh perspective to a ticket that already has the experience and judgment necessary to lead our country from day one
9122305 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer
9122306 i wouldnt vote for john mccain if he was a democrat
9122307 i would not vote at all before id vote for him
9122308 i question whether cindy is someone id want to see in the white house as first lady
9122309 im angry it makes me feel like a nonperson kind of
9122310 it is as if she is the real daughter i am also a real daughter
9122311 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9122312 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9122313 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms
9122314 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9122315 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9122316 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9122317 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9122318 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9122319 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9122320 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9122321 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9122322 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9122323 now i perk up smile and respond positively and thank them for reading adding that i hope they continue to enjoy the writing
9122324 doug mccaughan i will study each candidates but i know that gw bush is bankrupting this country and nothing he has
9122325 if i were mccain i would carry a mcdonalds coffee cup a lot
9122326 a survey participant cannot express a preference for dunkin donuts if theyre not around where they live
9122327 its not just about whether conservatives are drawn into one place or another the places where starbucks are located which are urban tend to have a more democratic constituency

9122369 theyve been going full blast for awhile i wanted to give them a rest there was no better time to do it than all in one day
9122370 i dont think about the bonus i bought a car and i live with a host family
9122371 these guys are basically living day to day on what they make that fine may look small but its like in any household when an unexpected expense comes in its big
9122372 i have a car but i live downtown with a host family that wont take any money
9122373 i dont have to buy that much gas although i do have car insurance and a cell phone
9122374 i get up at 5 every morning and im home at 5 at night and i still have to work out and throw every day
9122375 and then ive got to spend time with my fiancee and daughter we definitely dont do this for the money
9122376 if you sit and think about how much money you dont have its miserable there are times during the season you have no more money you have to pull yourself out of that i know a lot of guys who make a ton of money and still wish they were in baseball
9122377 the group 70 foundation fund is a donor advised fund at hawaii community foundation it is unique because it is funded by employee contributions so management steps back and employees select the organizations
9122378 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community
9122379 group 70 foundation is unique because management steps back and employees run the program
9122380 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community
9122381 when we formed group 70 foundation we collectively wished to demonstrate our commitment to building better communities in hawaii beyond our professional services our priority is to give back to hawaii our home the foundation is a testimony to our shared values of generosity civic duty service and philosophy we are pleased to once again have such a worthy group of recipients each of whom contributes to a sustainable hawaii in their own way
9122382 i feel very fortunate to be part of an organization that gives so much back to the community i especially appreciate it because of organizations like the y after school art programs and community centers that had helped keep me out of trouble and encouraged me in the right direction ive always imagined that one day id set up some sort of a trust or scholarship program to give back however since im not in a position to do so right now i am happy that i have the group 70 foundation to help me fulfill some of that dream
9122383 i am told that when conservative leaders heard the news this morning at a meeting at the council for national policy one attendee told me that there is
9122384 absolutely brilliant choice john mccain could not have chosen a better vice presidential nominee than gov palin she is attractive articulate conservative pro family pro life and pro marriage john mccain hit this one out of the ballpark
9122385 senator mccain made an outstanding pick from the choices that were on the table sarah palin clearly addresses the issues so many conservatives are concerned about it balances out the ticket
9122386 probably governor palin of alaska because shes a person of strong faith she just had her fifth child a downs syndrome child shes strongly pro life shes a virtual lifetime member of the national rifle association she would ring so many bells and i just think it would help with independents because shes a woman i think that from what i hear that would be the choice that would probably ring the most bells

9122396 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9122397 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate
9122398 a i quick 2008 existing already palin shes sarah bay 3
9122399 mccain voted 90 of the time with bush i dont know about you but i dont want to take a 10 chance on change
9122400 john mccain may pay hundreds of dollars for his shoes but we are the one who will pay for his flip flops
9122401 why chose an inexperience women when you have other qualified women
9122402 i dont believe that it is israels policy to increase activity in the settlements rather it is to decrease activity
9122403 in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949
9122404 israel is erasing the green line through intensive construction intended to create territorial continuity between settlement blocs and isolated settlements in the heart of the west bank
9122405 the policy and practices of israel in establishing settlements in the palestinian and other arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity and constitute a serious obstruction to achieving a comprehensive just and lasting peace in the middle east
9122406 calls upon the government and people of israel to cease on an urgent basis the establishment construction and planning of settlements in the arab territories occupied since 1967 including east jerusalem
9122407 there are some excuses that all of us can use or abuse in order to say something about the peace process or the peace negotiations

9122412 so abram went down to egypt in africa to live there as an alien
9122413 what kind of place is this that a young boys feet can look like those of an old man cracked and eroded
9122414 he dhoni handled the dreaded ajantha mendis with ease and in the process he showed his colleagues that mendis could be handled and scored off too
9122415 dhonis return to the team was a boon not only did he lead the side superbly but he played a couple of match winning knocks
9122416 more importantly he handled the dreaded ajantha mendis with ease and in the process he showed his colleagues that mendis could be handled and scored off too
9122417 man to man india were a superior team and they played like one for the last two years or so india have really gone up in the rankings by several notches and thats very heartening
9122418 mind you its tough to beat sri lanka on their home turf as no indian team has done it in the past and thats why it is more satisfying
9122419 i guess mendis was the difference between the two sides
9122420 besides the referral system needs a re look for a lot many batsmen were given out after stretching their front foot a long way forward
9122421 though there are quite a few players knocking at the test level at the moment the bench strength looks pretty solid and its not fair for me to answer this question as the selection panel consists of five people
9122422 well i cant be held responsible for somebody elses actions

9122425 enhances the purchasing power of the people with tax cuts and a variety of other measures to stimulate the economy
9122426 there are some sweeteners here and there but it fails to address some fundamental flaws in the economic policy issues of efficiency governance and endemic corruption
9122427 we continue to be in a state of denial we are not able to shift from the obsolete economic policy the rampant corruption and the failure to become more competitive because we are stuck in old policies
9122428 i see no way how we can attract foreign investment without foreign investment malaysia cant propel its economy and unfortunately this is not addressed
9122429 endemic corruption the tenders awarded to cronies and their families failure to cut cost and be more efficient
9122430 malaysia is the only country that continues to register a major deficit it is understandable for a country that does not have resources but we are not
9122431 they still have the audacity to talk about democracy and to preach about democratic process mind you democracy means in terms of governance an independent judiciary and free media which they dont have
9122432 to my mind it is really disappointing they have not seen the demand and the vast calls for reforms
9122433 efforts by certain parties to destabilise the country by attempting to seize power through illegitimate means and without the mandate of the people must be rejected
9122434 we cannot allow uncertainties to continue as this will adversely affect foreign investment economic sentiment and the capital markets
9122435 i will not permit the mandate given by the people to be seized from bn which won the last election with a majority of the seats based on democratic principles
9122436 the opposition on the other hand continues to make populist claims which if implemented would undermine the governments financial position and bequeath a bankrupt nation to the next generation

9122440 we encourage all of our parents to play an active role in their childs education and this is a great way to start
9122441 i wasnt nervous about the outcome of the takeover attempts but im not a patient man by nature and this deal required a lot of patience
9122442 if id walked through the door and suggested a deal at a cost of over half our market capitalization it might have been a little bit presumptuous
9122443 we had to get our five year strategy clear under my leadership first
9122444 when commodity prices are high canada is a very strong market
9122445 but it also has very low lows the u s market is slower to rise but also slower to fall and that gives us a buffer against canadas cycles
9122446 we didnt want to come in with all guns blazing
9122447 this is a small sector in which there havent been many proxy battles we did have a very carefully planned strategy and we thought the shareholders should decide and quite frankly we thought that our proposition trumped the basic merger
9122448 i never enter into negotiations without a very clear viable attractive alternative
9122449 a deals a deal and if it fails you go onto the next one
9122450 i thought why would this little baby see a relationship to barack obama
9122451 i prayed for the lord to send us a black president before i leave this world
9122452 as soon as i saw him i said the lord sent him to us for such a time as this
9122453 its just a changing of the guard of what kids want to be like more than being a rapper and an athlete more than what they see on the street corner
9122454 hes gone and far exceeded the expectations of what a black man can do coming over from africa to being in slavery to civil rights to jim crow laws we came so far
9122455 it becomes a movement if it has staying power beyond one candidacy its not clear if theres that organizing effort that would be needed to overthrow the old guard
9122456 for a young african american child to wake up one day and see in the rose garden two african american girls plucking roses playing in the garden and experiencing the bounty of that which is america

9122470 last year we threw it too much because we were just a bad rushing team
9122471 we cant rely on them to make every single play but even when theyre not sacking someone theyre going to be in somebodys face
9122472 having the defensive line the way it is makes it so much easier for everyone else
9122473 both of which went on to play in bcs bowl games
9122474 i didnt do a good enough job as head coach of identifying that and addressing it
9122475 was it something that hits you over the head no it wasnt it wasnt so evident to me on a day to day basis
9122476 i didnt realize it because my head was buried more into game planning and plays
9122477 im just trying to keep my fingers on the pulse a little better
9122478 when im not calling the plays ill be able to see a lot more of that at least i think so
9122479 if youre willing to learn lessons from it which ive tried to do then i think well be better for it
9122480 theyre not a spread team youre playing a downhill physical football team we better be ready for it
9122481 there was no doubt that the government had the numbers in its favour but it was a matter of faith when the state was witnessing large scale communal violence
9122482 a lot of discussion has taken place about the law and order situation in our state the situation in kandhamal district was returning to normality very fast in the rest of the state it is fully under control
9122483 the polit bureau in its statement has made a public censure and the chief minister has accepted it
9122484 his deepest condolences to those affected especially to the families of those who have been killed or who are missing
9122485 at a time like this it matters little how the floods started or who or what is at fault what is critical is urgent help to those in need
9122486 even at best of times south asia has many of the poorest in the world
9122487 these massive floods can wash away even the most basic hope that families have
9122488 an industry has grown up around adoption in which profit rather than the best interests of the child takes centre stage
9122489 appropriate legal mechanism and a functioning alternative care to parental care can prevent abuse and allow inter country adoption to continue for those who need it
9122490 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognizant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9122491 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9122492 the current response from the state department has virtually made narendra modi a persona non grata to the us
9122493 there have been stray incidents of violence in kandhamal we have also received reports of people burning a church in the district of bolangir

9122529 make government stand on your side not in your way
9122530 my family and i eat a healthy diet heavy in wild alaskan seafood moose caribou and fresh fruit
9122531 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
9122532 were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
9122533 we are in the process of talking to the government
9122534 we are in the process of talking to the government
9122535 use its most standards compliant mode ie8 standards as the default
9122536 home schoolers cheer california ruling but could face future attacks
9122537 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
9122538 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
9122539 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
9122540 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
9122541 that sits on its hands while a major american city drowns before our eyes
9122542 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right
9122543 come on guys be statesmen and use this as an opportunity to educate the public about how important it is to fully fund firefighters to educate the public and to be prepared
9122544 listen to the guy thats been on the mountaintop and listen to the guy thats been down into the valley of you know where nothing worked and listen to what i have to say
9122545 i think its great but i would not want to see john mccains vice president be a woman
9122546 i just cant wait i think were all jumping for joy and just really excited
9122547 she definitely as a woman has a certain spark about her that does bring that excitement
9122548 governor palin may be female but she does not support female issues
9122549 women can step up to the leadership role just as good as men and in some cases maybe even better
9122550 they have been doing that for a year and they really exposed us they have a nice scheme but we have to play better do what we are supposed to do and just play better everywhere
9122551 i think that is the first full game that i have been a part of at rice with patrick randolph and corbin smiter each getting their first touchdowns that really made my job easier tonight
9122552 the defense made some real big plays tonight to put some points on the board
9122553 instead of hitting the panic button tonight we shifted gears
9122554 no thought no breath no eyes no heart the pure remix ep
9122555 there were 12 stories of children entering into early marriage all but two were marriages to foreign loggers and six stories were about girls below the legal age of 15 there were two cases where a child was at risk of being trafficked or sold to be taken to another country
9122556 there were two cases where pornography was of solomon islander children there were also a further five cases of children being shown pornographic movies or pictures both within the camps and within the villages
9122557 the report therefore calls for a concerted effort which should be government led with a strong voice and action from the ministry of women children and youth in order to stop it
9122558 there were 12 stories of children entering into early marriage all but two were marriages to foreign loggers and six stories were about girls below the legal age of 15 there were two cases where a child was at risk of being trafficked or sold to be taken to another country
9122559 there were two cases where pornography was of solomon islander children there were also a further five cases of children being shown pornographic movies or pictures both within the camps and within the villages
9122560 the report therefore calls for a concerted effort which should be government led with a strong voice and action from the ministry of women children and youth in order to stop it
9122561 it was fun it did take a lot of time but its good exposure for us
9122562 we were the only location that did not get sunny to come to sunnyside
9122563 the seizure is an effort to help secure state assets
9122564 no one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin or his religion
9122565 sir there is a problem in florida there is this beast they call
9122566 quiet fools i have summoned chuck norris nothing can stand in his way

9122570 im the scariest super fuck thats ever walked the earth
9122571 the knower of truth should go about the world outwardly stupid like a child a madman or a devil
9122572 beer is proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy
9122573 from his mouth comes a sharp sword so that with it he may strike down the nations and he will rule them with a rod of iron and he treads the wine press of the fierce wrath of god the almighty
9122574 do not think that i came to bring peace on the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword
9122575 for i came to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother and a daughter in law against her mother in law 36 and a mans enemies will be the members of his household
9122576 then that lawless one will be revealed whom the lord will slay with the breath of his mouth and bring to an end by the appearance of his coming 9 that is the one whose coming is in accord with the activity of satan with all power and signs and false wonders
9122577 were cleared off because everybodys scared at some point in time whether it be me or the organization
9122578 its something i needed to do just to clear my mind and to make sure that this wasnt anything more serious than we thought it was
9122579 he said my ligament looked fine thats what i was afraid of my ligament
9122580 obviously tommy john surgery a lot of people come back from it but it takes a long time thats what i was afraid of with the stuff that i had going on i was afraid of that there was something going on with my ligament they did every test they do stress test put you in a vise shot dye in there
9122581 josh came through with flying colors and as general manager theo epstein said yesterday we kind of needed closure
9122582 i dont mean to sound flippant but i didnt think anything was wrong with him we did this for his peace of mind
9122583 its good news he got pretty much a clean bill of health
9122584 whats in your heart and in your minds in terms of where you want to take america
9122585 are they going to be able to live out the american dream
9122586 if were fighting for them there is nothing we cant do
9122587 he does not get what ordinary people in beaver county are going through
9122588 we could afford to invest right here in beaver pennsylvania
9122589 americas ready to get back up and this is the man thats going to get it back up
9122590 im not sure all the suits i have packed for the republican convention will be appropriate but ill just make do
9122591 we have so many people i can disappear from the air and frankly its no great loss
9122592 if this becomes a huge monstrous story well make a game time assessment
9122593 we are on hold waiting for orders from the dallas office
9122594 the governor has declared that there will never be another katrina and we are ready to respond it will probably be saturday or sunday before we have a staging area
9122595 we are prepping for shelter openings and have been doing a check of inventory and supplies to ensure that volunteers have what is needed
9122596 we will also decide if we need to access more supplies for future needs
9122597 alors les mots imprim s ces mots que personne ne lui a jamais dits ses l vres les prononcent
9122598 there is a great deal of advertising that is much better than the product when that happens all that the good advertising will do is put you out of business faster
9122599 if you know american history you know that obamas nomination is the social equivalent of landing a man on the moon
9122600 keith olbermann and chris matthews kicked things off right with some unabashed rejoicing replete with comparisons to alexander the great and aaron sorkin
9122601 we cannot continue to rely on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives weve set weve got to have a civilian national security force thats just as powerful just as strong just as well funded
9122602 im looking at him right now and i see perfection
9122603 yeah he has an extra chromosome i keep thinking in our world what is normal and what is perfect
9122604 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9122605 this seems like a final push by the administration before they go out the door
9122606 we have been at war with an unconventional enemy whose primary goal is to kill innocent americans
9122607 is trying to stir up again the politics of fear by reminding people of something they havent really forgotten that we are engaged in serious armed conflict with al qaeda
9122608 but the question is where is that conflict to be waged and by what means
9122609 as sept 11 2001 recedes into the past there are some people who have come to think of it as kind of a singular event and of there being nothing else out there
9122610 in a way we are the victims of our own success our own success being that another attack has been prevented
9122611 reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the united states may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations
9122612 i dont want to face another situation where we had the sept 14 resolution and then attorney general gonzales claimed that that was authorization to violate fisa
9122613 i do not believe that we are in a state of war whatsoever
9122614 we have an odious opponent that the criminal justice system is able to identify and indict and convict theyre not a goliath dont treat them that way
9122615 facing years in jail for a conviction of a single particular charge
9122616 in fact all the charges were municipal court violations that do not carry such penalties
9122617 it is not clear whether any order to disperse was given no legal observer sic witness or arrestee on the scene weve debriefed heard any order to disperse
9122618 numerous persons including legal observers asked to be able to leave the blockaded area and were refused
9122619 after the arrests attorneys from the peoples law project and the aclu arrived at the temporary arrestee processing site to conduct confidential attorney client consultations
9122620 the city refused to provide any access to allow these persons to meet with attorneys
9122621 i personally saw one such arrestee later at the city and county building i saw her marched from the elevator to the courtroom in bare feet and leg shackles i saw her appear in bare feet and leg shackles
9122622 some arrestees who could not make their own bond spent 6 7 8 or more hours waiting at taps before being transferred to court
9122623 the only access we were given to those clients was to whisper
9122624 attorneys were at the court from 11 pm on the night of aug 25 2008 and were staying until each and every arrestee came to the city and county building
9122625 under the totality of all the circumstances it was handled in a manner that best addressed the public safety at the time
9122626 someone clocked me in the face and took my shoe in the mosh pit this is a quicker route to the pepsi center
9122627 im marching because it seems to be the last vestiges of our free speech and because people have demands and our governments not listening
9122628 we dont want to hurt you we dont want you to hurt us
9122629 i figured as long as we kept things peaceful they would hear us and they did
9122630 rules and procedures that are transparent and rules of evidence that make sense and are fair these basic principles apply universally and without them the rule of law means little or nothing
9122631 it is quite obvious from casual observation that someone who has been known to have misled others including the countrys parliament has lost the moral authority to preach about the rule of law and good governance one wonders then what basic principles blair had in mind when he gave an almost unconditional support for the unilateral decision to invade iraq against the wishes of the international community and without the approval of the un indeed as late as april 2006 when an eminent british former law lord attacked guantanamo bay as a stain on american justice blair reportedly refused to follow suit
9122632 it is disgusting to see this criminal of the highest order being welcomed in malaysia and worse still to talk on the rule of law when he broke all international laws and the laws of his own country by deliberately lying and sending young british soldiers to die in a war of aggression
9122633 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
9122634 by supporting and participating in the 2003 united states led invasion and occupation of iraq i wonder whether britain being the worlds oldest democracy still possesses moral authority in a comity of nations to lecture on the principle of rule of law
9122635 i dont give a damn im happy as a clam
9122636 what brought delegates amp activists together to meet on the streets
9122637 i took basics of blogging and it was fabulous i left with all of the tools to get my own business blog running immediately worth every cent
9122638 what i love about working with beth is that no idea is too far out whatever i can think up shell ponder and support online she takes everything in stride
9122639 in the event of an emergency move away from the stadium
9122640 and the rockets red glare the bombs bursting in air
9122641 you mean my nose is going to have to bleed
9122642 all text is black but proper nouns should be highlighted with yellow
9122643 roads should be black lines while schools should be filled in with yellow
9122644 if it made sense for one stretch id have no problem doing that
9122645 ive shown in my career when im healthy i can get people out and i havent missed enough time where i feel cobwebs
9122646 its fun to watch especially for that city and knowing everything theyve been through there
9122647 the president today declared an emergency exists in the state of louisiana and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from gustav beginning on august 27 2008 and continuing
9122648 theres no sugar coating the challenging traffic situation but were doing everything we can to reduce the inconvenience to the fans coming in for the game
9122649 we have an entire day of great fan events in centennial olympic park so we urge everyone to arrive early follow the transportation plan and gear up for a great day of football
9122650 during practice theyre both rotating in so its not that big of a deal its probably more uncomfortable for the fans than it is for us actually
9122651 ive been working with them for two years now so theres really not much difference between the two
9122652 they put their hands in the same spot weve done a lot of work on that so theres pretty much no difference other than its a different person
9122653 there are times as a quarterback when it doesnt hurt you a bit to go over there on the sideline maybe for a series and observe kind of settle down and really know what youre seeing and then go back out there
9122654 ultimately you really dont know how those guys are going to play until they get in the game
9122655 they earned the opportunity to win this football game its a new era of sand creek football
9122656 i knew we could win after that first drive when we came out and did what we knew we could do
9122657 we slowed down but i knew we had to keep pushing
9122658 the defense stepped up and got us the ball back i knew we could keep rolling
9122659 im not happy with the way we played in the second half but at times i saw some really good things
9122660 que no ten a una relaci n fija con nadie
9122661 this is to build schools you cant have this corporate giveaway because its easy or you dont want to upset your friends or something like that
9122662 if there are minerals present that would be something the agency would have an interest in of course
9122663 that is why it would be important to have confirmation of what is there
9122664 gold and silver are present in small amounts throughout the earths crust in different materials
9122665 the investigation certainly appears to corroborate that version of events
9122666 sometimes you open the lid and it will be in there
9122667 overall i think the downtown community would be supportive because you would have open clear alleyways people would be able to see up and down and people wouldnt be able to hide behind them to do illegal activity
9122668 i think most of the community would be supportive depending on how much it costs and the logistics of pickup and how convenient or inconvenient it would be
9122669 anecdotally it does help an officer in a patrol car officers have a greater visual capability in checking out things without having to go down alleys and get out of cars
9122670 and from a public perspective it looks safer they can see what theyre walking into
9122671 its all about having a good time and being with other bike people
9122672 yeah critical mass is back theres a naked rider baby
9122673 every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9122674 funded by the robert wood johnson foundation rwjf in collaboration with the california healthcare foundation project healthdesign is a 5 million national program of phr systems administered by a national program office at the university of wisconsin madison project healthdesigns goal is to design and test a variety of phr tools and applications that work together to help people achieve their various and specific health goals in an integrated fashion the program is supported by the foundations pioneer portfolio which funds innovative projects that can lead to breakthrough improvements in the future of health and health care
9122675 rick schooler vice president and chief information officer of the orlando fla regional health system a seven hospital network has high hopes for electronic personal health records in the future he believes portable patient controlled web based phrs will form the basis for regional and national health information networks and give providers access to comprehensive health data on each patient
9122676 the washington state health care authority is spending 1 7 million to finance health record banking pilot projects in three communities two of the health care providers involved in the project have teamed up with microsoft healthvault and the other is partnered with google health
9122677 to improve quality and efficiency and reduce errors and unnecessary treatments across the healthcare system the national quality forum nqf has endorsed nine new national voluntary consensus standards for health information technology hit in the areas of electronic prescribing electronic health record ehr interoperability care management quality registries and the medical home these hit structural measures are intended to help providers assess the efficiency and standardization of current hit systems and identify areas where additional hit tools can be used
9122678 i believe this community has illustrated to us not the least of which was in four surveys that it is time to provide the community opportunity to make a decision the reality is that this has been requested of us the park district moves at the will of the people of this community and it is time to ask them what they want
9122679 success and prosperity are spiritual attributes belonging to all people but not necessarily used by all people
9122680 the st charles police department played an important role in the conviction of this defendant
9122681 if this tree had some color maybe it would look more magical
9122682 da kann ich leider nichts machen mir bleibt nur die m glichkeit so schnell zu fahren wie m glich und zu schauen was die anderen machen
9122683 die obere schotterschicht ist so fein und lose dass man als erster einfach sehr viel zeit verlieren kann
9122684 ich bin ans limit gegangen teilweise auch dar ber hinaus mein hauptziel f r sonntag ist es jetzt mindestens den dritten platz zu sichern
9122685 you never know how extensive and wonderful your community is until you get involved
9122686 we think of this less as a pageant and more about service and achievement which is what rotary is all about
9122687 with all the negative things you read this is so refreshing to see all these high achieving young women
9122688 we take a look at them and make sure theyre safe
9122689 he was a bit of a throwback a totally honorable guy but he lit up a room
9122690 if they were trying to get me there they never subpoenaed me that i am aware of
9122691 i thought why would this little baby see a relationship to barack obama
9122692 i prayed for the lord to send us a black president before i leave this world
9122693 as soon as i saw him i said the lord sent him to us for such a time as this
9122694 its just a changing of the guard of what kids want to be like more than being a rapper and an athlete more than what they see on the street corner
9122695 hes gone and far exceeded the expectations of what a black man can do coming over from africa to being in slavery to civil rights to jim crow laws we came so far
9122696 it becomes a movement if it has staying power beyond one candidacy its not clear if theres that organizing effort that would be needed to overthrow the old guard
9122697 for a young african american child to wake up one day and see in the rose garden two african american girls plucking roses playing in the garden and experiencing the bounty of that which is america
9122698 is a new birth of freedom for all of us
9122699 i refuse to believe that theres judges who would use these cases as a pawn in this fight
9122700 this increasing sheriffs electronic monitoring releases is not a permanent solution
9122701 it must include at some point an effective pretrial services department
9122702 what the district loses is everybodys attention and focus on educating the kids
9122703 were not going to let a week and a half go by until the next time
9122704 what should be going on now is various horse trading of pieces
9122705 the union feels that we will not put the district into deficit spending with our proposals
9122706 catholics confront creation the bible and creation science and creation the church and creation
9122707 hidden treasures in the jgsi library and highlights from the iajgs conference
9122708 the work of byron katie four questions that can change your life
9122709 the time of the end and the opening of the book of daniel
9122710 what is original sin and what does it have do with me
9122711 anyone who might otherwise see a connection should let us know please
9122712 people walk around with these devices kind of advertising what they have the bad guys take advantage of it
9122713 theyre real valuable theyre popular theyre easy to get rid of
9122714 i would go get coffee and leave it out here and just ask my friends to watch over it and a lot of times they would but i realize thats not safe at all
9122715 the wife said hey put that away somebody will take it away from you he kind of laughed at her sure enough some guy walked up behind him snatched it and took off running
9122716 i feel like when people are on the cell phone they dont pay attention to their surroundings so its important that when youre one the phone make sure of where youre at and whos around you if you have somebody behind you
9122717 well the recalls therell be a few more as we get out into the secondary processors and some of the third line
9122718 some of this product went out somewhere and other sandwiches were made out of it thats the nature of the recalls as they grow
9122719 the most important information for consumers is as we go out there we are providing further precision that informs them and lets them recognize these products in ways they werent able to do with the initial recall
9122720 it certainly does shake the confidence of consumers to know that its taking this amount of time
9122721 it just demonstrates that our need to make sure that we have absolute vigilance throughout this process is paramount
9122722 to insist harper take immediate action to put inspectors on the floor of meat processing plants
9122723 to very quickly restore the confidence of canadians and more importantly to protect canadians
9122724 in the u s they had a legislated commitment to visit the plants daily
9122725 we took a different approach originally which meant that those tasks were applied by the inspectors spending more time in the plants though not necessarily on a daily basis
9122726 with our system we were able to pick it up with relatively small numbers otherwise it might have gone unnoticed
9122727 it helped us to connect the dots in such a way that we were able to say we have something provincially going on
9122728 ive had this idea for a long time and i think youre the one who can find out more who can tell the story
9122729 were hoping for good weather record participation and a fun event
9122730 there are costs that are required and we have shifted our profits to these ministries for those causes
9122731 we have been very efficient costs are low and profits are high
9122732 it was just one more step in the healing process
9122733 win or lose it didnt matter to me and i said that before the game i just wanted to make sure we honored the gfellers and matt and just played football and we will continue to do that the rest of the season
9122734 coach decided i would have to run more this game because last year they didnt key on me running the ball
9122735 i said whatever i had to do to win the game whatever it took and so thats what i did
9122736 it was definitely tough for me we consider them like family and we are pretty close willert and propst are like best friends and we are around each other a lot it was tough going to the funeral and all that and it was a real tough week for us
9122737 i think its a lot of healing for everybody tonight it was good to see the fan support the good showing it was a game we had to do it win lose whatever it was a tough win i am just worried about propst and the reynolds family and i hope they can keep it going
9122738 we have to really work and in practice the best time to improve is the first week to the second week
9122739 we didnt really have a week this week obviously so this will be our second week and we will try to improve greatly
9122740 it was a dogfight we didnt play with fire until the second half
9122741 we didnt move the ball when we should have in the first half but we wore them out in the fourth quarter we did a good job up front the defense came around and we were impressive in the second half
9122742 theyve got a great offense they had 37 points last week against hertford county
9122743 we figured wed have to get at least 30 points to win and we only got 26
9122744 it came down to breaks and we made our breaks
9122745 we dont want to have a bunch of unused inventory lying around

9122755 si los estados europeos quieren servir a los intereses de la pol tica exterior de estados unidos entonces en mi opini n no van a conseguir nada de esto
9122756 un pa s en este caso rusia que puede ponerse en pie por el honor y la dignidad de sus ciudadanos defender sus vidas no estar aislado a pesar del pensamiento de bloque de nuestros socios en europa o en estados unidos
9122757 queremos unas relaciones buenas de vecindad de socios con todo el mundo no intentamos jugar con reglas especiales para nosotros queremos que todo el mundo trabaje de acuerdo a un conjunto de reglas conocido como derecho internacional
9122758 i dont know do you think youre good enough at math
9122759 my main reason for this is that i felt the four council members who voted against the proposed ordinance let us down
9122760 it really bothered me that night that they went ahead and voted they had agreed to wait until the 26th
9122761 in my opinion we have a serious problem in fremont with illegal immigrants
9122762 it gets frustrating because nothing seems to be getting done to address this
9122763 we re not willing to complain and sit and do nothing
9122764 i had a petition with me and someone asked me about it
9122765 as soon as one person signed it people kept coming
9122766 we re not prejudiced we re trying to protect the people who are here legally
9122767 the next thing you know the whole sky was dark and the wind was unbelievable i couldn t even see 2 feet out in front of our house there was hail and wind and tree branches and trees falling everywhere
9122768 we re looking at buying a more reliable phone dialer
9122769 we re in the process of getting people s e mail addresses now to be able to inform them
9122770 i think there s been a real spirit of community
9122771 everyone came together and helped i was amazed how many volunteer hours were put in
9122772 we lost power and thought it would be out for a few days
9122773 we had no water or sewage the pumps and lifts weren t working
9122774 if the electricity is going to be out longer than that we should be able to get a generator to use
9122775 we re looking at buying a more reliable phone dialer
9122776 we re in the process of getting people s e mail addresses now to be able to inform them
9122777 we didn t know how much we had in place with react cedar bluffs fire and nebraska emergency management
9122778 we ll get a lot more trees planted to replace them hopefully not cottonwoods
9122779 the salvation army donation the red cross donations they re all more important to many people now
9122780 our bedrooms were damaged in the storm so we are sleeping in the dining room
9122781 we had to do tree removal because it fell over on the fence we had to do that ourselves we had to rip out the carpeting that was wet to keep from getting mildew
9122782 we have had trouble with the insurance company and the bank
9122783 anything we ve done to this point has come out of our own pockets and we ve had to do a lot
9122784 that s a significant amount of money to take out of our savings and we did minimal things
9122785 the contractors are so busy right now because there is so much damage in the area
9122786 that will be three months before everything is back to normal
9122787 we just got the bill for august and it floored me our home isn t sealed we have the air on but it s not properly cooling the house it s costing us twice as much but it s not cooling the house like it should
9122788 we have bugs there are too many access points that aren t sealed for them when it s all said and done we re going to have to have an exterminator out
9122789 these are two expenses that the insurance company doesn t even look at
9122790 the carnival was across the street and we were wondering when the ferris wheel was going to tip over
9122791 i went to the door and i saw the wind coming in one direction and the hail and tree branches started flying
9122792 the next thing you know the whole sky was dark and the wind was unbelievable i couldn t even see 2 feet out in front of our house there was hail and wind and tree branches and trees falling everywhere
9122793 the storm came so fast that they couldn t get back to our house
9122794 with that high of winds i just knew i was going to have problems
9122795 i couldn t comprehend what i was looking at in terms of downed trees and powerlines and overturned boats
9122796 the closer i got i realized that it was probably my roof
9122797 i walked around in shock and finally there were fire engines and rescue squads the road was packed with cars and rescue equipment and emergency workers
9122798 the way it sounded and with the total lack of visibility i thought there might have been a tornado on top of us
9122799 i love storms but that was about the first time i ve really been scared
9122800 everybody was sort of in awe at the debris in the streets on the houses and in the lake there were entire trees in the lake
9122801 i looked at my dock and my pontoon and shore station weren t there
9122802 i figured they probably were loose and were floating in the cove somewhere but it the boat was upside down in the shore station at my neighbor s
9122803 we knew we had to face this devastation and think about what to do
9122804 we were both so depressed and i think in shock too and we just almost hated to come back
9122805 but when we drove down county road w here was a crew working on the big cottonwood that fell on our house
9122806 they d cleared the small branches and the larger ones so we could see our house
9122807 i can t express what a psychological lift that was just to see our house and that it wasn t completely demolished in front
9122808 by sunday evening it was as if nothing happened visibly it was cleaned up and gone
9122809 these people donated many many hours of equipment and help on their own
9122810 it was people helping people in a time of crisis
9122811 we re still in the process of getting bids to do that
9122812 it was a fantastic experience that i don t ever want to go through again
9122813 i look like daddy but i not dad i quinn
9122814 that s one of the benefits of being in the united states
9122815 they can do what they feel is right do i agree with it no
9122816 if this gets on the ballot and passes it still would be litigated
9122817 people need to have a little bit of patience and let this task force do its work we will come back with some solutions
9122818 i don t think this will have an effect on what we re trying to do with the task force
9122819 i see this as totally separate the people who are going to sign this petition are going to sign the petition we re going to do what we can do with the task force we re going to see what we can do in the community that is legal
9122820 if they do get the needed signatures to get this on the ballot how can they get something on the ballot that has been determined to be illegal
9122821 they feel they were cheated out of a third hearing and they re mad
9122822 for what illegal immigration costs the people of fremont that s peanuts
9122823 i think the community should have the opportunity to vote on what they think is right that s been my stance i believe it s the citizens of fremont who should make these decisions
9122824 if it goes to a vote the majority of the people will decide my main issue is the fiscal responsibility of paying for a special election i am worried about that added expense
9122825 this is a small percentage of the population being very vocal
9122826 they re out there chasing an emotional issue with not many facts we re trying to get information to the public
9122827 so you mean to tell me you havent had a cup of coffee since you got up
9122828 there s a number of grants we re applying for
9122829 our goal is to make it better than it was before and we re on our way
9122830 and at the very least considering open source could have given the government of quebec more negotiating leverage to get better pricing from microsoft
9122831 inspire people to find out what they are passionate about and then use those passions to make the world a better place if the lyrics and melodies touch you its less important what musical genre it comes from
9122832 in our soul we have deep feelings and emotions while we shift or change place of direction moving you to underground dance floors
9122833 and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon and it shall be when thou wilt ease thyself abroad thou shalt dig therewith and thou turn back and cover that which cometh from thee
9122834 for the lord thy god walketh in the midst of thy camp to deliver thee and to give up thine enemies before thee therefore shall thy camp be holy that he see no unclean thing in thee and turn away from thee
9122835 it the football laid around there for awhile i felt that our defense played with a different level of intensity tonight
9122836 we sat him down wednesday at practice tonight he kept telling us on the sideline to put him in
9122837 they left everything out on the field we had some opportunities tonight but we could not take advantage of them
9122838 you cannot make mistakes when you face a great team like st marys you cannot make too many mistakes
9122839 a win on the road in the western buckeye league is always big
9122840 coach todd clark has a talented team they are going to be a team to be reckoned with
9122841 to win in a hostile environment like this is big
9122842 we started the game with a three play and punt possession and then followed that with lost fumbles on back to back possessions
9122843 one upside was we were aggressive on defense and didnt give up any big plays
9122844 oconnor threw the ball well but he can improve on his decision making
9122845 if we want to be a good team we need to get consistent
9122846 we played good for all four quarters well get better because these kids work hard for me and the coaching staff
9122847 a lot of our runs in the first half were right off the center and thats where the biggest holes were
9122848 our guards were sweeping out their linebackers our o line and tight ends did a great job
9122849 we were real happy in the first half that we were able to open up some nice holes for our backs
9122850 last week against columbus st francis de sales we didnt have anything to run through so they the backs were real excited and the line blocked real well when you have backs running for that many yards its the linemen
9122851 were playing a lot of younger players the key is you try to improve and get better
9122852 hes good i watched him last year in eighth grade and i always thought he would be very very good
9122853 guys have been giving me a hard time all year about not having a walk off home run
9122854 every time we go into extra innings i have to listen to it now i guess theyll have to say something else
9122855 im sure if you play long enough youre going to hit one
9122856 everybody has little things in their statistical career that might make you scratch your head some guys never hit a grand slam or hit a bunch of them its one of those things but im glad to get the zero off there
9122857 every time we call upon one of those guys out there they do the job
9122858 this is probably since ive been here the best ive thrown
9122859 i was able to command my pitches and got into trouble a couple of times and was able to get out it
9122860 i thought that was going to win the game and it hooked just foul at the end
9122861 i didnt hit it as good as the first one but good enough to get it in the crawford seats and ill take it
9122862 we just thought if we had a chance to move forward wed take advantage of it
9122863 theyve both epitomized the professionalism that we pride ourselves on and are very talented guys their presence on the club speaks for itself
9122864 im very excited i think a lot of this organization i could have tested the free agent market but i think weve got a legitimate shot at winning here i think the pieces are in place we have to go out and do it and thats the main reason i signed back here
9122865 i played every day for quite a few years and the last two i was hurt for most of the time its that time in my career for a different role the guys we have on the team make it lot easier because you want to pull for them you want to pick them up because they play hard im here to do whatever i can to help
9122866 i would like to think i put that little thought in his head but hes a smart guy im sure he was thinking about her back then
9122867 when they started the speculation about vice president i started to do my own research and i just stumbled upon her name
9122868 i looked at her background and what shes done in alaska and i said my gosh shes turned that whole state around
9122869 today has been very special for my family for the president of the united states to take time out from his busy schedule
9122870 my family has been very humbled by the way weve been treated
9122871 it was a personal visit of the president of the united states with parents who have lost two sons to this war
9122872 they felt it was a very special time to have to have appreciation shown directly to them
9122873 were honoring a family and a soldier who has given up more than his fair share
9122874 all they want to do is work but there is no work available
9122875 farmworkers in the fields today are certainly and clearly not receiving the full protection of the law
9122876 im really very proud of that lap said johnson the defending race winner
9122877 regular season johnson is fourth in the season points but based on his two victories this year he currently would be the third seed in the chase trailing only eight time winner kyle busch and carl edwards a six time winner this season
9122878 yeah it would mean a lot for us to win on a big track like this johnson said before his qualifying run
9122879 mile and a half and above tracks and downforce tracks have been kind of our weak spot
9122880 weve been making a lot of gains hopefully we made some gains that will help us this weekend and moving into the chase
9122881 it just started the confidence in our minds that were ready for the chase he said
9122882 the top five guys in the points have a very good point of view or mind set theyre going to be in the chase so youre looking at what you need to do to be as good as you can in the chase and building the confidence around yourself and the team that you can be a contender
9122883 im trying to control all the emotions ill probably be so hyped and my adrenaline will be pumping so hard today that i might explode out there but i think ill be ok though
9122884 he has been very positive and has bought into what were doing
9122885 from my standpoint with the offensive line he has been a leader in our meeting room hes bought into the whole system there have been a lot of changes in what were working with offensively and up front but he has welcomed the changes
9122886 we have had some pretty good lines in the past but i would say that this is a special group
9122887 weve all just kind of clicked were all really close i think that when you have five offensive linemen like that guys who have clicked and are really close it has a more powerful effect on the team
9122888 were going to stick together and get it done we know that we have younger guys at the skill positions so we want them to know that they can just go out there and play and not worry about things
9122889 i would hope that were the strength of the team everyone can just ride on our shoulders and well get it done well be all right
9122890 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9122891 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9122892 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9122893 but two things didnt change we always won the game and i always had a big game
9122894 i remember telling chase we can show coach hatfield he has to throw the ball
9122895 it had a lot to do with great field position
9122896 when i see a certain coverage i know hell be in the right spot at the right time
9122897 this is by far the most special team ive been around in my five years here the attitude the enthusiasm the athletic ability the speed the strength were so much better in every category across the board
9122898 i talked to my father and my mom all the time and they tell me i couldnt be in a more perfect situation i came here not knowing what to expect and look what i got out of it i became an all american i graduated who could ask for a better ending
9122899 i was pretty sure i was safe its definitely frustrating it changes the outcome of the game
9122900 it changes the momentum instead of being down 3 2 they get out of the inning soriano comes up and hits a home run now theyre up 3 2
9122901 we plan on playing aggressive confident football for 60 minutes
9122902 theres a sense that we could on the verge of a special season and everyone wants to be a part of it
9122903 theyre flying to the ball we may not be as big but this is a group that is well ahead of expectations
9122904 at this point it is critical that we dont get complacent
9122905 we were able to reach many of our goals last season but we still have a lot of room for improvement
9122906 i get the opportunity to throw the ball around a little bit and i dont have to take as much of a beating like i did last year by running the ball
9122907 i think what impressed me the most was when i called him in my office and told him that its open competition at the quarterback position
9122908 he embraced that and understood that didnt pout about it
9122909 not because im in the offense and i dont have a choice if i had a choice this is the offense i would want to be in
9122910 we have three nfl coaches on our staff and theyve all told me that im an nfl guy
9122911 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9122912 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9122913 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9122914 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9122915 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9122916 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9122917 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9122918 we fought hard theyre a great team they hit us and we just decided to hit back
9122919 were inexperienced up front on the offensive line and we were making a lot of blocking assignment mistakes
9122920 we settled them down they were kind of wide eyed
9122921 we should have caught the ball thats just inexperience and ill take the blame for that
9122922 theyve got a great tradition and theyve been in big games weve been in big games too i think most people knew we would respond at halftime we always have
9122923 simply because we havent played as consistently well as we want to the last two years
9122924 texas always has a very polished team that has great talent but they arent tough
9122925 well put three hats on them and make them not want to get up thats the way to beat texas
9122926 when you dont have to go out on the field and do something its easy to say something the real talking is going to be when you line up
9122927 we just thought there were a couple times last year where we didnt get started right
9122928 normalmente preferir a estar drogada en el maletero de un coche que va camino de un acantilado
9122929 esto es lo que yo quer a explicar en mi charla esta feria demuestra el poder de la literatura la fuerza creativa de los libros y la imaginaci n
9122930 theres no way im going to vote for one of these two clowns
9122931 i like hillary in part because shes got bill and hes great
9122932 you know speaking as a private citizen sarah palin is not qualified to be my president shes not ready to run this country
9122933 you may have heard about the dehydrating effects of caffeine
9122934 joseph bidens being set up to protect israel while barack obama looks after the transportation system in chicago
9122935 esta tormenta tiene el potencial de ser una tormenta muy peligrosa
9122936 los deslaves e inundaciones ser n una amenaza para la vida humana
9122937 calling upon them to submit a detailed report of the violence in the state since the killing of religious leader laxmanananda saraswati and four others
9122938 our national spirit must exude joy and pleasure and say you have done well daughter of zimbabwe we are proud of you we wish you well shes our golden girl take care of her
9122939 we figured out how to get the mother of all blood stem cells with the right culture conditions
9122940 there is real hope that in the future we can grow billions of blood cells at will to treat blood related disorders and just as critically if not more so weve got ace as a new old marker to guide our work
9122941 but were very pleasantly surprised to discover it as a beacon for finding the earliest blood stem cells known as well as new ways to find and manipulate this marker to make them grow
9122942 we can make lots and lots of blood cells from human stem cells for transfusions regenerate new vascular trees for heart diseases as well as create test tube factories for making transplantable blood cells that treat diseases we are very far from treatment
9122943 we have a lot of evidence and the connection between so many cases of dna will allow us to eventually solve this
9122944 this is the mind of a maniac but we have a tight victim profile and powerful evidence that has taken us across the country
9122945 the victims are the most vulnerable in society and we know the suspect is involved in prostitution eventually we will find him
9122946 today on that third anniversary weve got to be thinking about the future
9122947 as we pray for the best were going to prepare for the worst
9122948 as we continue to monitor and prepare for the possibility of hurricane gustav i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so
9122949 whatever small way youre able to help its a great feeling
9122950 you can build levees that are 100 feet high its not going to keep the rain out of the city a very very intense period of rain could flood the city because the pace of the rainfall could exceed the ability to pump out of the city
9122951 we evacuate we protect the integrity of the levees we continue to strengthen the levees thats part of a total system of really driving down the risk to the people of new orleans
9122952 if theres going to be dating in a game dont make it like sleepover pokemon gotta bang em all
9122953 and theres this guy from brazil name starts with a b banka or something blanka yeah blanka hes green and makes electricity
9122954 these behaviors are a significant cause of enuresis and incontinence
9122955 a lady in her car saw the plane and got out and ran
9122956 people wonder when they order a salad why it smells like a swamp
9122957 we came into the series as underdogs for sure but the boys have been magnificent
9122958 it is an exciting place to be the england dressing room
9122959 but we want to improve and try to win 5 0 if we can i want the guys to enjoy this victory and then turn up on sunday at lords ready to go 4 0 up
9122960 let me in ill sing with you guys ill be your friend

9122963 with the end of the olympics in beijing all eyes turned for a moment to london site of the upcoming 2012 summer olympics
9122964 all i have is my story and im writing it while i still remember it
9122965 she gave her life for me and for that i am forever grateful
9122966 shows all the deterioration of a man on the way to the grave
9122967 the baby got the worst of it he came out white
9122968 you been on this earth so many years and you never had a woman
9122969 it was the first time a woman ever kissed me
9122970 it was may 1965 i was 26 years old i came home
9122971 we have to trust each other sex is part of it
9122972 permission was not sought or granted nor would it have been given
9122973 hold for release do not use hold for release do not use
9122974 im relaxed i helped make this sport the old fans know me from a long time ago now im sending a message to the new fans i am a samurai im not afraid of anything ill fight anyone
9122975 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
9122976 the only good thing that may come out of this is that evangelicals would be more excited and willing to vote for mccain but thats about it
9122977 all this b s that the republicans are racist and sexist yet colin powell and condi rice were some of the biggest players in the rnc now sarah has been confirmed what does that tell you about the dnc hypocrits
9122978 if this is true this moves me from staying at home to voting mccain
9122979 poor digby and mm its a tough day for yall and things are about to go from bad to worse obama is toast
9122980 planned parenthood more than to have a prolife woman on the national stage ending the feminist claim that they speak for all women
9122981 and seeing her with her newborn downs son whom she calls
9122982 i had no idea your political choices were based on such sentimentalism
9122983 i ardently disagree with you about the roman catholic church in america for which i worked before i left the country the right wingers who write here own its hierarchical leadership as i found out over and over again
9122984 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9122985 mccain has basically neutralized his inexperience line which was to date his major theme against obama
9122986 is this any different than the often parroted insistence that the usccb is the democratic party at prayer which has been uttered countless times in the comboxes of vn do you also have a problem with that characterization or will that get a pass
9122987 and why do you care anyway digby why dont you just stay in germany and listen to some more david hasselhoff
9122988 remember the vice prez is not making policy the president is
9122989 she added that if elected she would not push the state board of education to add such creation based alternatives to the states required curriculum
9122990 which swing states have obama supporters and undecided who will defect to mccain
9122991 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides
9122992 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9122993 the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect
9122994 the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9122995 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
9122996 restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future
9122997 of course obama doesnt think he is the messiah and neither do his supporters anyone with an ounce of media literacy can tell the way in which the mccain camp dreamed up and promulgates that lie
9122998 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
9122999 to affirm that there is an absolute constitutional protection of life in gestation would lead to the violation of the fundamental rights of women
9123000 the case is very significant for the possibility of continuing this trend in other states in the republic
9123001 the arguments and the way in which they defended womens rights is very important very symbolic
9123002 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
9123003 congrats to them they played extremely hard and with a lot of passion

9123006 senator mccain condemns torture but votes against the bill that would prevent it
9123007 allowed the cia to retain the capacity to employ alternative interrogation techniques
9123008 senator mccain voted against it presumably because he wishes that the cia be permitted to continue the use of other of its enhanced techniques apart from waterboarding those techniques are reported to include stress positions hypothermia threats to the detainee and his family severe sleep deprivation and severe sensory deprivation
9123009 presumably because he wishes that the cia be permitted to continue the use of otherof its enhanced techniques apart from waterboarding

9123011 mccain obama voted the party line 95 percent of the time
9123012 should osama have a right to refuse to answer any questions beyond name rank and serial number
9123013 no individual in the custody or under the effective control of an element of the intelligence community or instrumentality thereof regardless of nationality or physical location shall be subject to any treatment or technique of interrogation not authorized by the united states army field manual on human intelligence collector operations
9123014 tom malinowski the washington director of human rights watch said he disagreed with mccains vote and believes
9123015 a fair reading of the prohibition on cruel inhumane and degrading treatment outlaws waterboarding and
9123016 therefore it is flatly wrong to claim that mccain wants the cia to use the
9123017 administration officials have stated in recent days that this technique is no longer in use
9123018 ive already voted to ban all torture but im not going to vote to ban other interrogation techniques that have nothing to do with torture

9123020 humans are goal directed in virtue of their recognition of goods specific to their nature to be achieved
9123021 benefits human beings as such and to what benefits human beings in particular roles within particular contexts of practice
9123022 human beings need to learn to understand themselves as practical reasoners about goods about what on particular occasions it is best for them to do and about how it is best for them to live out their lives
9123023 qualities of mind and character that enable someone both to recognize the relevant goods and to use the relevant skills in achieving them the excellences the virtues that distinguish or should distinguish teacher from apprentice or student
9123024 overcome the harms dangers temptations and distractions we encounter and which will furnish us with increasing self knowledge and increasing knowledge of the good
9123025 we are looking inward for a need for some psychological fact about us that makes it deeply distressing to us to live shapelessly incoherently discontinuously meaninglessly to live without standards
9123026 it will be a central thesis of this book that the virtues that we need if we are to develop from our initial animal condition into that of independent rational agents and the virtues that we need if we are to confront and respond to vulnerability and disability both in ourselves and in others belong to one and the same set of virtues the distinctive virtues of dependent rational animals whose dependence rationality and animality have to be understood in relationship to each other
9123027 our bodies are animal bodies with the identity and continuities of animal bodies
9123028 although this account of the virtues is teleological it does not require any allegiance to aristotles metaphysical biology
9123029 it is not only that the same kind of exercise of the same kind of perceptual powers provides guides and corrects beliefs in the case of dolphins and some other species as in the case of humans but that our whole initial bodily comportment towards the world is originally an animal comportment and that when through having become language users we under the guidance of parents and others restructure that comportment elaborate and in new ways correct our beliefs and redirect our activities we never make ourselves independent of our animal nature and inheritance
9123030 comparisons make sense only when they are put in the context of the entire character of the species concerned and of the known principles governing resemblances between species
9123031 when you have looked at the relation of the act to other relevant habits and needs when you have considered the whole nature of the species comparison may be possible and helpful
9123032 for the story of my life is always embedded in the story of those communities form which i derive my identity i am born with a past and to try to cut myself off from that past in the individualist mode is to deform my present relationships the possession of an historical identity and the possession of a social identity coincide

9123034 matthew 14 6 12 corrupted by power herod had come to take whatever it is he wanted to live in the realm of desire and to meet that desire head on and so he was tricked and done in by that desire and it led him to have the baptist killed showing once again the truth of jesus words
9123035 say now to the rebellious house do you not know what these things mean
9123036 here i would like to indicate one of them the option or love of preference for the poor this is an option or a special form of primacy in the exercise of christian charity to which the whole tradition of the church bears witness it affects the life of each christian inasmuch as he or she seeks to imitate the life of christ but it applies equally to our social responsibilities and hence to our manner of living and to the logical decisions to be made concerning the ownership and use of goods

9123038 the first qualification to be vice president of the united states qualified to become president of the united states at a moments notice
9123039 protection of life in all its stages from the first moment of conception to natural death
9123040 recognition and promotion of the natural structure of the family as a union between a man and a woman based on marriage and its defense from attempts to make it juridically equivalent to radically different forms of union which in reality harm it and contribute to its de stabilization obscuring its particular character and its irreplaceable social role
9123041 actually i beg to differ digby i think a lot of the objection to vox nova from the catholic right is that they are not acting as a reliable arm of the republican party in the culture wars there are conservative voices here liberal voices and in between voices and they are all faithful ardent catholics its one of reasons i value vn
9123042 you are mistaken if you think there are any substantive differences between obama and mccain on foreign policy the situation in iraq and the greater middle east will probably be the same regardless of who the next president is
9123043 there is only one man who has truly fought for america
9123044 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9123045 dayton sen charles schumer is among the first out of the gates with democratic reaction to the sarah palin selection
9123046 after the great success of the democratic convention the choice of sarah palin is surely a hail mary pass
9123047 thats also something you do not just on here but on other blogs talk about personal attacks
9123048 we must deal with the water before we argue as to how to seal up the damage
9123049 it takes much less respect for life to show no concern for those who are right before you
9123050 showing no concern for those who are right before you
9123051 for the last seven years this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century the emergence of russia china and india as great powers the spread of lethal weapons the shortage of secure supplies of energy food and water the challenge of climate change and the resurgence of fundamentalism in afghanistan and pakistan the real central front against terrorism
9123052 in recent days weve once again seen the consequences of this neglect with russias challenge to the free and democratic country of georgia barack obama and i will end this neglect we will hold russia accountable for its actions and well help the people of georgia rebuild
9123053 joe often didnt know what he thought until he had to say it
9123054 is what ive spent my entire adult life preparing for
9123055 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
9123056 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
9123057 now as i said there are pros too which others are focusing on maybe palin will be a terrific candidate and vice president but lets not underestimate the potential downside undermining lack of experience and tokenism charges against obama and a greater risk overall especially in debates
9123058 on the other hand as kate obeirne just told me we know that palin will be ready for that 3 a
9123059 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both and you know i say this too as the daughter of a science teacher growing up with being so privileged and blessed to be given a lot of information on on both sides of the subject creationism and evolution its been a healthy foundation for me but dont be afraid of information and let kids debate both sides

9123105 bangalore is one of indias fastest growing cities but it is sad that a modern city like bangalore with the best of amenities witnesses a rapid rise in suicide deaths
9123106 in bangalore all are stressed out be it a child an it professional or a migrant labour the city does not provide social and mental security to its wide range of population
9123107 most of our callers suffer from stress and a sense of loneliness and deprivation often we counsel the callers over the phone and if one is ready to visit us personally we encourage them to do so till date we have counselled around 3 600 persons
9123108 work related insecurity extended working hours and stringent deadlines contribute to rising number of suicides in the city no one has time for anyone we are all becoming very very self centric severing us from all human bonding and love thus a sense of insecurity is driving many to end their lives

9123142 we have a high level of respect for georgia southern
9123143 most of their kids are from in state just as ours are we think it will be a pretty heated rivalry a great majority of our georgia guys have high school teammates on their team
9123144 i dont know how theyre going to react if we were playing in front of 92 000 or in front of 4 000
9123145 i just dont know i wish i did i sure would sleep better at night
9123146 is it a good thing its good if we stay there if were there at the end
9123147 our players know that and theyve prepared the best that they can prepare well try to play hard and see what happens
9123148 jerrys done a great job in guiding the program certainly theyre in position to play strong against anybody they have a great football team its not specific to any division
9123149 i guess theres a lot of uncertainty but thats just part of the game you just kind of have to focus on doing your job what you can do each day controlling the things you can control and not worry about the things you cant
9123150 we need big play from those guys we need leadership and for them to do the things that they had done all last season
9123151 our expectation is that our offensive line will play well
9123152 were going to have those big guys come up the field at him
9123153 were fortunate to have some athletic ends that we think can run as well
9123154 they have been doing that for a year and they really exposed us they have a nice scheme but we have to play better do what we are supposed to do and just play better everywhere
9123155 i think that is the first full game that i have been a part of at rice with patrick randolph and corbin smiter each getting their first touchdowns that really made my job easier tonight
9123156 the defense made some real big plays tonight to put some points on the board

9123175 the trip to phoenix to meet robert kiyosaki was a great experience and opened some doors for possible future opportunities
9123176 however she was still offended by how she spent money and time on me have me meet robert kiyosaki and i sign the agreement only to back out 10 minutes later
9123177 she seems very genuine and i feel i can trust her so over the next couple of days as she starts arranging the phoenix trip i tell her about my story
9123178 i tell them that i now have a good feeling about them now that we have met in person both of them really do seem genuine just wanting to help me out
9123179 on the way over i talk to her some more about real estate and other things
9123180 both prlinkbiz and the phoenix investor lady seem so genuine they just want to help me
9123181 the phoenix investor lady is also willing to help me out of my foreclosure situation and teach me to be a successful real estate investor
9123182 the other part of the offer was that prlinkbiz has a great idea for documenting and sharing my come back story with the world
9123183 so i impulsively tell prlinkbiz i like the idea and say something along the lines of
9123184 i call prlinbiz and tell her that i put the other guys on hold and i want to proceed
9123185 i was offered a great opportunity and they have a very good real estate mentorship package as part of the deal there was some miscommunication originally about that but today we got all that straightened out i am also extending my stay here until the weekend
9123186 prlinkbiz and the investor lady take me out to lunch again
9123187 starting right now i will do whatever you want me to do and i will sign whatever i need to sign letsgoforit
9123188 i go on to tell them how sick i am of being in this mess and how im ready for action i thank prlinkbiz for arranging for me to meet robert kiyosaki i thank her for introducing me to the phoenix investor lady i tell the investor lady that if she is still willing take me on im ready right now
9123189 prlinkbiz sends me over some paperwork and invites me to a 3 way instant messenger chat with the phoenix investor lady to iron out the details
9123190 at this point the phoenix investor lady and i agree with you
9123191 we then address my concerns about working together we talk through the issues and get better understanding of both sides very productive meeting
9123192 we just want to see you start working on a solution one way or another with us or someone else
9123193 i dont want to blame prlinkbiz too much i found out later that at this point of the story she thinks that im getting cold feet
9123194 i later found out prlinkbiz was very concerned about me too
9123195 again i dont blame the ladies too much i probably wasnt doing a good job of communicating my concerns to them i was looking for a step by step plan and they didnt appear to have one we obviously had a difference of expectations
9123196 i still believe the ladies had good intentions to help me i am very thankful to them especially to prlinkbiz for robert kiyosaki meeting they were both very encouraging and supportive of me we just were never truly on the same page and i think it was my fault for 1 i failing to communicate my needs desires clearly and 2 i jumping into it impulsively without thinking everything out
9123197 of course she is supportive of my decisions as long as i find a way to get us out of this mess and allow her to continue her education

9123204 he lived with them while going to phoenix college in the mid 1960s although it is not technically an arabic recipe all my sisters in law nieces and nephews in kuwait request auntie marla to make huge batches of these for them before ramadan starts they just have to have them for guests when they drop by for a nightly visit

9123213 we have observed spectroscopic changes in temperature sensitive molecular lines in the magnetic splitting of an fe i line and in the continuum brightness of over 1000 sunspot umbrae from 1990 2005 skriver livingston ch penn
9123214 all three measurements show consistent trends in which the darkest parts of the sunspot umbra have become warmer 45k per year and their magnetic field strengths have decreased 77 gauss per year independently of the normal 11 year sunspot cycle a linear extrapolation of these trends suggests that few sunspots will be visible after 2015
9123215 sunspots are cool dark regions on the solar surface with strong magnetic fields there have been few direct measurements of changes in the physical parameters of sunspots but here we present a study which shows that sunspots are becoming warmer and have weaker magnetic fields the number of sunspots visible on the sun normally shows an 11 year periodicity and the current sunspot cycle cycle 23 had a maximum in 2001 and is entering a minimum phase with few sunspots currently visible our data show that there are additional changes occurring in sunspots independent of the sunspot cycle and these trends suggest that sunspots will disappear completely such an event would not be unprecedented since during a famous episode from 1645 1715 known as the maunder minimum the normal 11 year periodicity vanished and there were virtually no sunspots visible on the solar surface eddy 1976 recent studies of the appearance rate and latitudinal drift of sunspots hathaway et al 2004 and of the solar magnetic field svalgard etal 2005 predict that the number of sunspots visible in future cycles will be significantly reduced finally the occurrence of prolonged periods with no sunspots is important to climate studies since the maunder minimum was shown to correspond with the reduced average global temperatures on the earth foukal et al 1990
9123216 analysis of the suns varying activity in the last two millennia indicates that contrary to the ipccs speculation about man made global warming as high as 5 8 c within the next hundred years a long period of cool climate with its coldest phase around 2030 is to be expected
9123217 we need not wait until 2030 to see whether the forecast of the next deep gleissberg minimum is correct a declining trend in solar activity and global temperature should become manifest long before the deepest point in the development the current 11 year sunspot cycle 23 with its considerably weaker activity seems to be a first indication of the new trend especially as it was predicted on the basis of solar motion cycles two decades ago as to temperature only el ni o periods should interrupt the downward trend but even el ni os should become less frequent and strong the outcome of this further long range climate forecast solely based on solar activity may be considered to be a touchstone of the ipccs hypothesis of man made global warming

9123221 wed probably like to do something in that area just part time or whatever

9123223 he had the opportunity to do missionary work earlier this year when he was offered the 300 000 plus a year job as queensland trade commissioner to the americas
9123224 if he really wanted to do missionary work he could have refused that job i think hes certainly not lost his mastery of trying to put a public relations spin on his current position

9123233 cuba buat yang terbaik untuk kebahagian dia namun aku tahu aku tewas walau apa pun yang aku lakukan cuba penuhi hajatnya walau kadangkala memakan diri sendiri namun masih diri ini belum di hargai dan hari ini aku pasrah aku letih mengejar cinta dia walau apa pun cinta itu bukan milik aku dia takkan memilih aku walau apa keadaan pun melainkan perlukan pertolonganku aku punya dia tapi bukan hati dia 7 tahun bersama tak pernah nama ini bermain di bibir saat lena namun insan lain jua menghias mimpi indah hingga terbawa di lafaz jaga mungkin dia perlukan insan yang bisa manjakan dia yang cantik terasa setaraf dengannya yang mengerti kehendak dia yang menerima apa jua katanya aku tak begitu kerana aku memikirkan masa depan bukan hanya untuk hidup hari ini sedih airmata darah sekali pun tak bisa buat dia cinta pada aku kalau hati dah tak suka menerima kerana terpaksa apa pun yang aku lakukan taraf aku masih sama di matanya
9123234 terasa hinanya diri ini menagih cinta orang ingatkan cinta rupanya umpan untuk dijadikan boneka aku tau aku tak secantik dia tak semanja dia kerana jiwa ini dah lama hancur dek kecurangan yang berkali kali berselang kemaafan yang di pohon menagih simpati aku yang buta buta pada sandiwara yang memakan diri sendiri buta sejak dulu cinta dia bukan untuk aku dia hanya mengikat aku sekurang kurangnya tidak di keji asyik ditinggalkan wanita bila kekasih hati pergi masih ada patung bernyawa ini bila ketemu yang baru patung ini dijadikan perhiasan
9123235 apa yang aku dapat bersamanya bukan mengungkit tapi bila diri di permainkan dan di pergunakan begini terasa sia sia segala pengorbanan bersama dia rasanya lebih baik sendiri aku masih mengharap pada pertolongan keluarga dia hanya tau berlagak dengan kesenangan yang bukan milik dia menumpang memerah segala keringat ini mungkin ini balasan tuhan pada aku jika dipandang dia memang baik pada aku malah andai aku bercerita keburukan dia sekali pun tak mungkin ada yang percaya tapi aku yang tinggal sebumbung dan sekatil dengan nya ini lebih tau isi hati dia yang sebenar aku akui layanan dia bisa menarik ramai gadis untuk menagih kasih dan kerana itu jua aku merana

9123355 today senator mccain made an exciting decision in choosing alaska governor sarah palin to join him on his ticket as the vice presidential candidate governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayers dollars and champion for accountability in government
9123356 i applaud senator mccain for selecting governor palin this decision is yet another example of why the american people can trust him to make wise decisions and to confidently lead this country
9123357 the speech expresses gratitude the president will thank his family his administration and most of all the friends supporters and volunteers in the convention hall who have supported him and the republican agenda for these past eight years the speech reviews the major issues facing the country from terrorism and war to the economy and the direction of our culture
9123358 the speech reflects on the role of the presidency and the qualities that are demanded by the job and makes the case that john mccain is the best qualified to be our next leader and commander in chief
9123359 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9123360 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9123361 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate senator mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate

9123619 o clube hoje n o tem uma receita para ser auto sustent vel temos que trabalhar com essa multid o prestando bons servi os aos s cios
9123620 joguei a toalha antes pois n o acreditei que vencer amos ou sequer empatar amos com o
9123621 prefiro s falar na quarta amanh na coletiva l vou informar as medidas que ser o tomadas
9123622 acredito e credito toda confian a em meu time e principalmente em minha diretoria
9123623 o santa na s rie d poder trazer preju zo rivalidade sim e isso poder esvaziar o pernambucano
9123624 eu sou santa cruz de corpo e alma e serei sempre de cora o
9123625 por que existem na galeria das fotos dos ex presidentes lugares vagos
9123626 quem nasceu do jeito que eu nasci viveu do jeito que eu vivi e chegou at onde est porque um vencedor por isso eu n o sou um perdedor eu estou perdedor
9123627 todas as atitudes que tomei foi para o bem do clube por isso saio de cabe a erguida e com a certeza do dever cumprido mas infelizmente os resultados de campo foram ruins por isso estou sendo julgado
9123628 o santa cruz n o est em crise o santa cruz a pr pria crise
9123629 pessoal temos que pensar numa forma de criarmos para a pr xima gest o e mediante aceita o pr estabelecida dos futuros dirigentes um grupo consultivo organizado com composi o estabelecida que contribua para que a administra o tenha subs dios suficientes para trabalhar com mais qualidade a sugest o que a partir de id ias fundamentadas claro esse grupo possa propor sugerir a es implementar campanhas e auxiliar no debate ter amos ent o uma inst ncia de apoio com o reconhecimento da administra o mas que fique bem claro sem pretens es de paralelismos obviamente sabemos que existem pessoas com ac mulo suficiente aqui no blog temos v rias para tocar essa proposta e executar o trabalho de uma forma organizada
9123630 temos que fazer um time competitivo para ficar em 3 lugar isso obriga o do santa cruz com todo respeito as equipes do interior
9123631 a nova diretoria tem que oferecer algo em troca da participa o dos torcedores nem que sea informa ao tem que acabar com essa hist ria de fazer caridade para o santa o santa cruz pode ser um bom neg cio
9123632 ele deveria ter renunciado a nica coisa que justifica sua perman ncia a manipula o do processo eleitoral
9123633 est tudo indefinido ainda n o existe comiss o eleitoral n o existe data ningu m sabe da lista de s cio estamos em um buraco negro
9123634 edinho deveria ter cumprido o estatuto que fala em publica o de tr s editais fazer elei o assim loucura n o ter tempo para costurar alian as quem assumir vai apenas pagar contas e se desgastar pois n o ter como contratar jogador por exemplo j que as competi es ainda estar o em andamento
9123635 edinho acertou em deixar o conselho deliberativo definir o dia do pleito acho que um m s tempo suficiente para fazer a elei o e o novo presidente assume em outubro assim ter dois meses para arrumar a casa e fazer o time
9123636 quem assumir ter que pagar as d vidas mesmo ent o n o importa ser em outubro ou novembro
9123637 torcida coral n o esque am que romerito entregou o santa cruz com uma d vida astronomica empregou o filho dele como diretor remunerado quem fazia a seguran a do clube era a sua empresa antecipou cotas nos fez vergonha nacional ao fazermos a pior campanha da s rie a e ninguem sabe ninguem viu o dinheiro da venda de carlinhos bala do emprestimo de rosembrink da venda de roversio feita as escuras devido a tudo isso n o podemos esquecer romerito

9123643 n o poss vel um candidato presid ncia do santa cruz dar uma declara o de que devemos pensar em ser terceiro lugar
9123644 bom deixar claro que n o estamos preocupados com o nome que vai ser o presidente o nosso pensamento est voltado para encontrar um planejamento uma filosofia de trabalho para o clube
9123645 na minha opini o quem quiser se candidatar que se candidate n o h problema algum nisso a torcida isto os s cios em dia galdino cad tu escolher o o presidente

9123652 o santa cruz n o pode disputar a s rie d antes de 2010 porque assim est previsto no estatuto do torcedor

9123669 como presidente eu sempre disse que o regime era presidencialista e a ltima palavra era a minha agora que eu estou saindo assumo todas as responsabilidades e todos os erros que cometi pe o desculpa a torcida por toda a crise
9123670 eu quero ser o facilitador para a escolha de um novo presidente e n o vou esconder nada do que est acontecendo no clube

9123682 mais uma vez as for as e os meus interesses contra o clube do povo coordenam se e novamente se desencadeiam por mim
9123683 n s temos de tirar um aprendizado das coisas negativas das nossas vidas um profissional como eu que se dedica ao m ximo nunca deve vir para um clube de massa como o santa cruz que atravessa uma grande crise financeira e pol tica
9123684 n o me arrependo estou muito honrado mas a gente tem que ver bem a situa o de um clube quando eu cheguei aqui muitos jogadores n o quiseram vir eu sei tamb m que o torcedor sabe que o bag tem muita pouca culpa do que aconteceu eu acho que fiz o poss vel e o imposs vel
9123685 o planejamento foi feito em cima da copa pernambuco competi o sem respaldo nenhum a gente sabia que a s rie c um campeonato complicado e que a tend ncia era acontecer o que aconteceu
9123686 hoje eu tenho vergonha de voltar par o rio grande do sul
9123687 pessoas que afundaram o santa cruz n o confie neles para nada
9123688 aqui edson nojeira o pior presidente que j passou pelas bandas do arruda

9123698 pode deixar de existir o departamento de futebol ou at o clube mas se eu ver um caba jogando domin com a camisa do santa por ele que vou torcer
9123699 p xa para mim dani um pantera da atualidade algu m que consegue organizar caravanas para outras cidades ser reconhecida como dani tricolor em qualquer local do recife e adjac ncias e tal identidade est ferida por culpa de imbecis que fizeram o favor de destruir parte ou a na o completa que o santa cruz

9123704 i dont think so garry if you are going to announce games pay attention
9123705 after 22 years four of which have been dissatisfying time to call it quits
9123706 junto a los seres alados vi cuatro ruedas que brillaban como si fueran topacio por su apariencia las cuatro ruedas semejaban ser en el momento una rueda dentro de otra rueda cuando los seres alados avanzaban en una de las cuatro direcciones no se ten an que volver sino que avanzaban en la direcci n en la que iba el de adelante
9123707 y el sonido de las alas de los querubines se escuch hasta en la corte como la voz del gran dios cuando l habla

9123714 that was a little bit too much information because i dont want anyone getting in touch with my medical records because i have had my identity stolen before and i am still fighting with it in the credit bureau
9123715 the future is some thing which everyone reaches at the rate of sixty minutes an hour whatever he does whoever he is
9123716 mere change is not growth growth is the synthesis of change and continuity and where there is no continuity there is no growth
9123717 paris might still be great for food if you have a wad of cash and a desire for the best of the best
9123718 tokyo is a shining star in the world of cuisine
9123719 we found the citys restaurants to be excellent featuring the best ingredients culinary talents and a tradition passed on from generation to generation and refined by todays chefs
9123720 the new face of the wi does not come younger or hipper than jazz mellor
9123721 i thought it would fit in really well with the wi
9123722 some of my friends thought it was great others thought it was weird
9123723 we have been doing lots of craft based activities knitting sewing things like that
9123724 because i had such a rocknroll childhood the only way for me to rebel was to go the other way as a child i was always fascinated by knitting i had to go to my great grandmother to learn how to knit because my grandmother was a hippy and my mum was a punk
9123725 a steam train fan has built a working miniature railway in his front garden
9123726 ive always had an interest in railways as a kid i used to go trainspotting
9123727 a few years ago i went to a railway exhibition and saw the model trains running around and i thought that would look nice in my garden
9123728 i started building the railway three years ago and i make everything myself
9123729 i make all the houses and stations from plywood and the tiles on the top are made from cedar wood
9123730 drinkers have chased down and collared an alleged serial thief after a brazen attempt to rob a brisbane pub
9123731 we dont encourage vigilante actions but in this situation i applaud their actions
9123732 i think the staff and patrons realised they had the numbers on this fellow and the end result was a good one
9123733 this greek lebanese style meat loaf is sliced and served with pita bread tzatziki and tomatoes for a delicious gyro that is the closest ive come to emulating my favorite mediterranean restaurant the preparation time seems long but most of it is resting time so you can be doing other stuff you can substitute pork or chicken for the ground lamb and beef if you prefer
9123734 an airship or dirigible is a buoyant lighter than air aircraft that can be steered and propelled through the air unlike aerodynamic vehicles such as fixed wing aircraft and helicopters which stay aloft by moving an airfoil through the air in order to produce lift aerostatic craft such as airships and balloons stay aloft by filling a large cavity with lighter than air gas

9123737 real men of genius mr too much cologne wearer you slather cologne on like its going out of style thank you for helping us realize how much better we could all smell etc
9123738 oh while were at it theres also the coal that fueled the industrial revolution in the united states kept the country heated during all of its great wars and allowed the big steel companies to make all of the great industrial marvels of the past century
9123739 gee i dunno maybe the constitution of the united states of america or the declaration of independence which i might add were based upon the frame of government of pennsylvania its constitution before
9123740 compares favorably to brandywine but is an earlier and heavier cropper
9123741 this big beautiful pink mama cuts and tastes like filet mignon
9123742 very sweet and rich as good as a tomato gets
9123743 i can relate to them they have personality they have history they have flair they have everything
9123744 eating a thick juicy mortgage lifter slab marbled with white like fat is like having a last steak supper before you die and go to tomato heaven
9123745 we wanted to live in a place with a sense of community
9123746 the first time i saw the site the only thing left was a charred foundation
9123747 it was intended to be a modern interpretation of a craftsman style house
9123748 design build allows us to implement design during construction because your architect and builder are one and the same
9123749 buying time for heritage how to save an endangered historic property
9123750 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
9123751 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
9123752 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
9123753 we will now move on a cycle where we refresh and add to the product line over time
9123754 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
9123755 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
9123756 the workforce reduction is part of a broader strategy to lower general and administrative costs in light of the current economic climate and market demands
9123757 owen likes it so much that he made an offer on a home there
9123758 amazingly dr nelson has today flatly admitted that the governments alcopops initiative directly hits teenage binge drinking yet he is still recklessly blocking the measure
9123759 no amount of senate trickery will hide the fact that dr nelson is trying to blow a hole in the budget surplus and preventing the government from tackling teenage binge drinking in the process
9123760 our members do not seek to profit from a situation in which the government is forced to return tax revenues collected without senate approval
9123761 if and when enabling legislation is rejected by the senate all revenue gained from this poorly conceived tax trial should be returned to the community for use in alcohol related harm minimisation programs
9123762 we are greatly strengthened and helped in this very difficult time by the expressions of sympathy and the kind comments about priestleys life and career made by so many people and in particular by the staff and cast of all saints channel 7 and his friends and colleagues
9123763 these remarks are greatly treasured and help us immensely in our terrible loss
9123764 we are especially grateful to channel 7 for their consideration towards mark in recent times
9123765 i am pleased to see senator obama acknowledge the huge potential alaskas natural gas reserves represent in terms of clean energy and sound jobs
9123766 the steps taken by the alaska state legislature this past week demonstrate that we are ready willing and able to supply the energy our nation needs
9123767 over the next five years we should also lease more of the national petroleum reserve in alaska for oil and gas production and we should also tap more of our substantial natural gas reserves and work with the canadian government to finally build the alaska natural gas pipeline delivering clean natural gas and creating good jobs in the process
9123768 the council of ministers decided to appoint general jean kahwaji to the post of chief of the lebanese army
9123769 we are fighting a battle together for peace and stability in the region
9123770 palestine would stand by the lebanese state in all its decisions
9123771 the allegations surfaced during the investigation but we had to do our due diligence
9123772 caseys attorney jose baez diligently tried to contact authorities to surrender his client
9123773 the arrest and the drama at the anthony home tonight only added insult upon injury for the family of the kidnapped child
9123774 there are phenomenal improvements at the federal level at the state level and local level that were going to benefit from and that youll be able to watch and see as a result
9123775 we all know that the system has not been completed to withstand the 100 year storm level which is set to be in place by 2011
9123776 but the system is better than it was pre katrina we are cautiously optimistic
9123777 intel has traditionally taken an active roll in creating markets for our products
9123778 they have been almost evangelical about wimax and it hasnt caught on
9123779 its kind of hard to get volunteers to go right now
9123780 its happening pretty quickly now because weve had volunteers step up really quickly and say ill do it but the recruitment process can take two days then getting them there and working out the travel arrangements can take another day theyre doing it as quickly as they can this has happened very quickly they are recruiting hard core for this one
9123781 pre staging cuts out that lengthy process of getting people there that eight hour drive is out of the way theyre sitting right now and basically its a waiting game
9123782 thats what these folks will be doing too then theyll dispatch them out to wherever the damage is when they need them but it takes out the extensive travel time up front
9123783 it makes for very long days lots of challenges and a lot of rewards from the people that you help
9123784 the rewards are the looks on peoples faces and their thank yous
9123785 we could get assigned anywhere from there since we dont know where the storms coming in theyre scattering people out at different locations in anticipation
9123786 the story of hans reiser is well known to all slashdotters by now some still placed doubts about the conviction stating that he might be innocent it now seems that all doubt has been quelled since alameda county district attorney thomas orloff has revealed that
9123787 every year is an election year for public officials around the country
9123788 every day appointments are made to fill important governmental positions of authority from the local to the federal level can we the american public feel confident that our elected or appointed government officials of the mormon faith will act in the best interest of those they are elected or appointed to represent or are they in bondage to fulfill the interest of their church over the people they serve
9123789 only true and living church on the face of the whole earth
9123790 well duh my 200 canon has been capturing video for years
9123791 what a gimmick who would ever use video on a 1 000 piece of photographic equipment
9123792 well i guess it might sometimes be useful to snag a video clip when im out shooting stills
9123793 club frontier is going to cost me a lot of money
9123794 we are going to meet and make a decision today
9123795 people are just getting ready schools in session city offices are open
9123796 but weve been going to get food cleaning supplies and bottled water and preparing the generators and getting gas now we just have to sit and wait
9123797 we would definitely go down to help again but i think its a little premature
9123798 theyve spent so much time rebuilding from katrina it would be a shame to see something happen to them
9123799 weve established a relationship and rapport with groups in that area in the wake of katrina and here they are on the anniversary of that storm in the gunsight of another hurricane
9123800 and if they reach out again in need i know a number of people in this community will step up to help but i know the people of gautier are undoubtedly better prepared for storms after the horrendous katrina event
9123801 and people who have lived through devastating floods have a lot of empathy for one another
9123802 with what shes done in alaska shes proven that she capable shes got executive experience
9123803 shes very smart i think she will hold up pretty well against biden in the debates
9123804 when i first heard about it i was in columbus and i was extremely pleased
9123805 shes only been a governor for two years but mr obama has only been a senator for three years
9123806 i think it balances the republican ticket as im sure the democrats felt that mr biden balanced out their ticket
9123807 shes solidly conservative on a lot of key issues and shes a fresh face with a lot of executive experience and thats pretty novel in this race thats one thing about her she was the governor of a state
9123808 and thats very different than being a legislature you have to make a lot more decisions
9123809 we put this exhibit together from our library collection of probably more than 1 000 photos of riverboats and it was designed to coincide with the sternwheel festival sept 5 6 and 7
9123810 this is the first time weve done an exhibit of this type and we hope to do others
9123811 we also want to offer the exhibit to museums up and down the river as many of these boats plied the waters from pittsburgh to cincinnati
9123812 woody and i went through the hoag and fischer collections together
9123813 it was like catnip for two cats who really love river history
9123814 we tried to pick out photos that people may not have seen before
9123815 mr fischer really recorded the history of marietta he was consumed with capturing the history of the moment
9123816 were very lucky to have had him and to have these collections
9123817 its still fun last year i had one that got seventh and one that came in last and that was ok
9123818 getting them to lead properly at first is really hard

9123829 theyre decked out in their osu gear and you have chants of o h i o

9123834 thats why we have to keep having these things to keep rooting them on
9123835 i can remember watching on a black and white tv back in 1959 when i was 5 years old
9123836 i attended ohio university and im not the only ou grad to be a buckeye first and afterwards

9124147 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9124148 e necessario che anche la regione toscana nella sua veste di soggetto istituzionale coinvolto nellapprovazione del progetto della terza corsia autostradale faccia completamente la sua parte per quanto attiene la verifica delle modalit di realizzazione sia della nuova galleria del melarancio nel tratto fra certosa e scandicci che dellintero tratto autostradale in fase di realizzazione attorno a firenze
9124149 gli interessi in gioco non sono infatti di rilevanza esclusivamente locale afferma ma riguardano lintera viabilit a livello regionale e addirittura nazionale se infatti la tempistica dei lavori e la stessa fattibilit del progetto divenissero incerti si rischierebbe veramente di tagliare in due il paese e di arrecare danni incalcolabili alleconomia dellintera area fiorentina e a quella regionale
9124150 a questo punto prosegue carraresi un intervento della regione toscana attraverso i propri uffici e il pieno e tempestivo coinvolgimento di altri soggetti regionali quali lazienda sanitaria e larpat divengono veramente urgenti
9124151 di riferire su quanto accaduto gi nel corso della prima seduta consiliare di settembre
9124152 un deciso intervento affinch ogni ipotesi di cassa integrazione per i dipendenti che rischiano di rimanere inattivi a causa dello stop ai lavori venga limitato ai tempi tecnici strettamente necessari
9124153 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9124154 un provvedimento serio e condivisibile perch in italia esiste una vera e propria emergenza educativa a cui la scuola non pu sottrarsi
9124155 ludc ha sempre creduto fina dalla scorsa legislatura nella necessit di reintrodurre il voto in condotta e di riportare nelle aule scolastiche lo studio delleducazione civica quindi non possiamo che essere soddisfatti cera bisogno da parte del governo di un segnale forte ed arrivato conclude ciocchetti adesso spetta ai docenti rendere efficaci le nuove disposizioni
9124156 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9124157 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9124158 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9124159 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9124160 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9124161 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9124162 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale
9124163 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9124164 come commissario il mio compito quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale
9124165 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9124166 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9124167 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9124168 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9124169 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9124170 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9124180 no a ingresso nel pdl con pd dialogo e non intese
9124181 se lofferta quella di entrare nel pdl noi rispondiamo di no perch ci saremmo gi entrati qualche mese prima delle elezioni e con veltroni dialogo in parlamento punto e basta senza equivoci di natura politica
9124182 e comunque facile prevedere precisa che nella gran parte dei casi sar fisiologico una conferma delle alleanze locali con le forze di centrodestra con le quali c un rapporto che dura da pi di 10 anni
9124183 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono
9124184 rafforzare unarea autonoma e centrale della politica italiana larea occupata finora dalludc e che attraverso la fase costituente si allargher a nuovi soggetti
9124185 quando il governo ci ha prospettato in parlamento alcune questioni che noi ritenevamo utili agli italiani sottolinea cesa abbiamo tenuto un atteggiamento positivo quando invece si trattato di opporci come e accaduto per il dpef abbiamo assunto una posizione critica

9124190 svendita ad air france che il governo prodi intendeva realizzare
9124191 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
9124192 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
9124193 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
9124194 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
9124195 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
9124196 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti
9124197 e facile fare i miracoli con i soldi degli italiani scaricando il buco dellalitalia sulle spalle dei cittadini
9124198 per valutare limpatto che il nuovo piano di ristrutturazione di alitalia avr sulla citt di roma
9124199 c un insieme di strumenti legislativi ammortizzatori sociali in gestione al ministero del lavoro che sono pi che sufficienti a risolvere il problema

9124204 crediamo che alla scuola serva chiarezza ha spiegato il ministro per questo ci sar un ritorno dei voti accompagnati dai giudizi che saranno esplicativi del risultato raggiunto dai ragazzi
9124205 il consiglio dei ministri ha espresso parere favorevole in merito al ritorno al maestro unico per la scuola primaria ha detto il ministro il provvedimento sar contenuto nel piano programmatico per la scuola contenuto nella finanziaria e su cui stiamo lavorando con il ministro tremonti

9124210 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama dice lex presidente del consiglio che parla subito dopo lintervento in proposito del premier silvio berlusconi non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie da parte mia conclude prodi non ho alcuna contrariet al fatto che tutte le mie telefonate siano rese pubbliche
9124211 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9124231 if you go into the united arab emirates census youll find there is around 12 000 australians living in dubai mostly male mostly in the 25 to 34 year age group
9124232 here is an example of one country that has drawn out a specific age demographic out of australia which has contributed to the man drought
9124233 she just reminded me of my grandmothers lemon meringue pie
9124234 its important that shes clean and that shes not forgotten
9124235 taking care of my father prepared me to take of her
9124236 she goes to yard sales and shes been to doctors appointments the supermarket and to an outdoor concert
9124237 when we talk lemon always waits a few minutes and then shell quack she has to add her two cents to the conversation
9124238 her message is even though we have challenges we still can have a happy life with the help of our friends
9124239 wear an old pair of sneakers because youll be braking fred flintstone style on pavement you steer with your shoulder and your foot
9124240 when i heard about it i wished i was between the ages of 11 and 14
9124241 its always been my favorite winter sport though its a little obscure
9124242 hopping in a sled and taking a couple of runs
9124243 every person in this sport has a similar story not many people grow up with the dream of becoming a luge athlete
9124244 its a new sensation there are not a whole lot of things in life where you lie on your back and go at that speed even a relatively slow speed its pretty exhilarating
9124245 a good sense of balance coachability good hand eye coordination and lack of fear
9124246 trip to lake placid new york to try the sport on ice on an actual olympic style track
9124247 will bring the olympic spirit here to the city of new bedford
9124248 it is going to be great fun for new bedford area children and their families
9124249 if youre strictly looking at the strict counts thats not good news
9124250 well report on how close stocks are to their fully rebuilt sizes and to the fishing rates necessary to complete rebuilding on schedule or to end overfishing
9124251 with this information the council will have a good idea of how restrictive amendment 16 fishing measures need to be
9124252 its getting to the point where there are not a lot of people left in the industry
9124253 there is massive consolidation in the industry there are a lot fewer fishermen out on the water and fewer permits the regulations have gotten to be really really strict
9124254 the fishing rate has to come down most often that means a lower catch and thats going to hurt
9124255 the fact that this is occurring is very concerning to us
9124256 its a childlike prank where the circumstances are anything other than childlike
9124257 at that time there are no witnesses a house catches on fire and by the time the smoking alarm goes off it can already be engulfed in flames its a big deal
9124258 our patrol officers and detective are working proactively in identifying the individuals responsible
9124259 h du er ret langt henne vi skal lige sende det til unders gelse
9124260 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
9124261 traditionally september is a weak month for stocks and i dont think were going to escape that
9124262 i do think we are going to stay in a trading range i dont see this market falling out of bed and going below the july lows
9124263 in case of war redzikowo and slupsk will be more secure than other places and not less secure
9124264 you condemned redzikowo and slupsk to annihilation like hiroshima and nagasaki
9124265 the pineapple companies tell us the water is clean but the government wont let us drink it
9124266 we are the busiest weve ever been period all four services all of our instructors have done multiple deployments
9124267 is going to swing by in suda bay crete and pick up humanitarian supplies and will probably not arrive before some time next week
9124268 the dallas a us coast guard ship has completed its offloading of humanitarian relief supplies in batumi and has departed batumi
9124269 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
9124270 sarah palins chief qualification for being elected governor was that she was not frank murkowski
9124271 she was not elected because she was a conservative she was not elected because of her grasp of issues or because of her track record as the mayor of wasilla
9124272 i think it raises its profile i dont think it changes the steps you go through it is what it is you have to find out what happened
9124273 quiet and not given to self promotion a very gracious man
9124274 i had an amazing amount of luck to race for 22 years and not a drop of blood or a broken bone
9124275 always fearful and throughout his career he struggled to find a balance between the perils and pleasures of his profession
9124276 by the mid 1950s he had become americas best sports car racer
9124277 ive lost some hip velocity to age and some to injury the build up of scar tissue
9124278 i played my whole life right up to university level but my pharmacy degree took precedence over that
9124279 ive still got another year of junior eligibility left but im not going back
9124280 with long drive its tough i dont have any slow motion in me everythings power
9124281 ive been doing this six years you get pretty good at something you just want to keep doing it
9124282 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9124283 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9124284 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward gov palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9124285 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9124286 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9124287 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9124288 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9124289 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9124290 our regard for each other rose out of christian fellowship then it turns out we had common passions one of which was music
9124291 heres the odd thing weve all been called to our churches all within the last eight years and we all happen to have a background in music and performance in addition to our passion for the lord this is what i mean when i say its gods idea nobody put an ad in the paper for tryouts its a devotion thing
9124292 the band is proof that god has a sense of humor
9124293 he is a creative guy and he really inspires me greatly
9124294 he is the inspiration for this process he is like the sun he has all this creative energy which really defines him and his faith is part of that it hitches a ride on all that energy he stimulates my creativity
9124295 the truth is we have theological differences in our group but we love each other
9124296 we recognize in each other that were all here because of god to do his work and care for his people
9124297 and to have a good time while were doing it
9124298 the fact is that the discharged weapon is extremely dangerous and could have triggered an entire cascade of events that would have been extremely unfortunate
9124299 as i begin serving the good people of our lady of the assumption parish i am aware of the long history of this parish family in which i am blessed to share
9124300 since its inception in 1905 sacred hearts religious have served here it will be my privilege to share in their continuing story of walking in faith as gods people
9124301 learning to discern god in my life was not something natural to me
9124302 while i was becoming active in church activities in high school and college coming to know my personal response and responsibility to god was openness i needed to grow in and i continue to need this openness to god even today
9124303 at age 27 i didnt feel that i had the personal maturity and life experience to take on the commitments that catholic priesthood requires of men in the modern world
9124304 i also realized that while i was very knowledgeable about many aspects of the catholic faith my personal relationship with god was immature
9124305 i saw for the first time sisters priests and brothers working with each other praying together and enjoying each others company
9124306 this was something i wanted to investigate and possibly have for myself
9124307 that year was one of the most life changing events of my life
9124308 for one thing i was a minority for the first time this was a humbling experience when for the first time i could put myself in the shoes of people who come to the u s but who feel like they are outsiders this was also the time where i deepened my love and understanding for the congregation of the sacred hearts i felt at home this was where i belonged in my service to gods people
9124309 working with and learning from the people of god was a great experience of growth for me
9124310 it was important for me to develop my gifts and talents in a concerted way as i discerned how i would live my religious life the people of fairhaven were used by god to help solidify my identity as a man who was a sacred hearts religious
9124311 serving the people of the bahamas as a deacon and as a priest has been one of the greatest blessings of my life
9124312 the bahamian people in sharing their gifts with me helped me to grow in comfort with expressing the love of god in my life in my own ways they had a definitive hand in forming me into the religious i am today and i am grateful to them for this gift
9124313 it was important for me to find moments to listen to god in prayer and through concerned people about where god might be leading me
9124314 this was a period of redefining and a recommitment of who i am called to be as servant of god i know that i can become so involved in the necessary activities of religious life and priestly life that listening to gods guidance can be drowned out this is a fact i need to remember as i continue my own journey of faith
9124315 i have become very acquainted with my gifts and also my human weakness
9124316 it is through these that i can walk with people in their own happy and difficult life moments i continue to be grateful to god and to the many people ive been blessed to know on my journey of faith each person has helped me grow and understand gods everlasting faithfulness to me i am a very blessed man for the life i have been allowed to live as a religious of the sacred hearts congregation
9124317 i cant think of a time when i didnt enjoy reading but i cant remember actually owning a book as a child
9124318 we look ahead to a better day as we also prepare ourselves for another threat
9124319 i think god is reminding us that on the eve of katrina god can bring nature back
9124320 develop a strong belief that attaining goals is within ones own control
9124321 my dream is not to die in poverty but to have poverty die in me
9124322 breaking off diplomatic relations with tbilisi is not moscows choice and the responsibility lies with tbilisi
9124323 if european countries want to serve the foreign policy interests of the united states in my view they wont win anything from this
9124324 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
9124325 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
9124326 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
9124327 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
9124328 but i think we all feel our development people especially that he can handle whatever comes at him
9124329 i dont mean to sound flippant about it because i certainly wasnt but i didnt think anything was wrong with him
9124330 the ball came out of his hand too good the other day
9124331 i dont trust anybody more than i trust him when it comes to stuff like that
9124332 it was something i needed to do just to clear my mind
9124333 im just looking to get out here and throw a little bit
9124334 get a bullpen or two under my belt hopefully we can start by next weekend
9124335 its getting to that point in the season where were heading into september and he seems to have a lot left
9124336 theres a little bit of doubt going through your head generally i think as a professional athlete when something happens i was actually talking to the pilot of the plane about that
9124337 if something happened to his eye he got something in his eye it would be something similar to that
9124338 it was just one of those things where theres that doubt between me and my pitching coach my manager we had many conversations about it and this is something that we needed to do
9124339 if we wait to post the ad until there is a decision on the community representatives from each town it will put us a month behind schedule
9124340 the charge doesnt say that the search committee should put together an ad which is probably an oversight on our part but that is the way it reads
9124341 it would be preferable for me to at least talk with these people
9124342 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9124343 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9124344 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy things a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built
9124345 lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9124346 at first they had me in a bunch of furs
9124347 yeah i have furs on my wall but i dont wear furs i had to show them my bunny boots and my north face clothing
9124348 id rather go moose hunting than be involved with politics
9124349 sarah palin for her entire political career has been underestimated
9124350 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9124351 i can do what i want it is the truest reflection of me
9124352 there is a creative expression that the store lets me have and that sets me apart from the masses
9124353 i give my design ideas to customers while they shop our clients get inspired and always anticipate new ideas
9124354 through three floods and three designs i liked all of the changes
9124355 i told susan i wanted this to look old philadelphia
9124356 hibbs says but she also wanted the penthouse to look fresh and new
9124357 my mo was to give drama without taking away from the beautiful views
9124358 she gives her opinion but doesnt force you into anything she is patient and will get right down on her hands and knees with contractors so the job is done the way she wants it
9124359 we will come in even after another designer has worked on a house and just do accessories it is a big part of our consulting business
9124360 as a designer you are inundated with the newest and the latest
9124361 it is hard not to respond to trends but our area is more traditional and the challenge is to redefine our traditional roots while giving customers modern pieces as well
9124362 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9124363 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9124364 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9124365 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9124366 im also not going to tell you how much we got from the sale of the green tax for green energy thats all there is to it
9124367 the cowman who cleans his range of wolves does not realize that he is taking over the wolfs job of trimming the herd to fit the range
9124368 in wildness is the salvation of the world and the preservation of all life long known among wolves and mountains polar bears eagles oak hickory amp sequoia trees wild lilacs eagles songbirds frogs lizards and native invertebrates but seldom perceived by man
9124369 some carbon offsets are purchased in order to fund projects like wind farms and solar installations but theyre not actually removing any of the pollution produced
9124370 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9124371 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9124372 if this turns out to be a nonevent the market could really come roaring back down
9124373 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9124374 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9124375 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
9124376 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
9124377 while everyone celebrates labor day we have foxwoods management repeatedly violating our rights as if it is above the law foxwoods should obey the law and sit down with us and negotiate a contract
9124378 the mashantucket pequot tribal nation has repeatedly stated that although it disagrees with the nlrb regarding jurisdiction employees do have the right to support unions under tribal law and that violation of those rights will not be tolerated
9124379 although we feel strongly that tribal law is applicable here the tribe will continue to engage in government to government communications with the nlrb to assure that agency that the rights of employees at foxwoods are being respected
9124380 consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth
9124381 we think the worst is yet to come for consumers
9124382 at this time we are still planting salad every two weeks removing finished crops early squash bush beans and there is continuous weeding
9124383 when its looking full i just sneak in the side
9124384 children who were reticent about eating their vegetables are more inclined to eat them when they pick them they see that beans arent just green but purple and yellow
9124385 but the best part is the hour or two of entertainment a week kids come and explore and learn
9124386 some of the kids whose families come here are so eager to learn and take home a desire to have their own gardens at home thats good
9124387 in the late spring any family who wanted to planted a hill of pumpkins here and theyve tended their pumpkins with tlc all summer with mixed results the kids have loved the repetitive task of watering particularly i think just wandering around the bounty of a place like ours is so good for them it makes an impression that lasts your whole life my grandmothers garden certainly marked me for my future who knew
9124388 have you ever put basil in the middle of a bouquet of flowers
9124389 everything slows now the light is waning daily the light in late august is the same as late april our harvest will continue until first frost which has hit us as early as sept 21 and as late as oct 10
9124390 trees swayin in the summer breeze as we walked by
9124391 immerse the costa rican people in the beauty and importance of this world heritage site
9124392 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face
9124393 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9124394 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9124395 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9124396 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9124397 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9124398 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9124399 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9124400 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9124401 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency
9124402 simply because we havent played as consistently well as we want to the last two years
9124403 texas always has a very polished team that has great talent but they arent tough
9124404 well put three hats on them and make them not want to get up thats the way to beat texas
9124405 when you dont have to go out on the field and do something its easy to say something the real talking is going to be when you line up
9124406 we just thought there were a couple times last year where we didnt get started right
9124407 i get the opportunity to throw the ball around a little bit and i dont have to take as much of a beating like i did last year by running the ball
9124408 i think what impressed me the most was when i called him in my office and told him that its open competition at the quarterback position
9124409 he embraced that and understood that didnt pout about it
9124410 not because im in the offense and i dont have a choice if i had a choice this is the offense i would want to be in
9124411 we have three nfl coaches on our staff and theyve all told me that im an nfl guy
9124412 im trying to control all the emotions ill probably be so hyped and my adrenaline will be pumping so hard today that i might explode out there but i think ill be ok though
9124413 he has been very positive and has bought into what were doing
9124414 from my standpoint with the offensive line he has been a leader in our meeting room hes bought into the whole system there have been a lot of changes in what were working with offensively and up front but he has welcomed the changes
9124415 we have had some pretty good lines in the past but i would say that this is a special group
9124416 weve all just kind of clicked were all really close i think that when you have five offensive linemen like that guys who have clicked and are really close it has a more powerful effect on the team
9124417 were going to stick together and get it done we know that we have younger guys at the skill positions so we want them to know that they can just go out there and play and not worry about things
9124418 i would hope that were the strength of the team everyone can just ride on our shoulders and well get it done well be all right
9124419 but two things didnt change we always won the game and i always had a big game
9124420 i remember telling chase we can show coach hatfield he has to throw the ball
9124421 it had a lot to do with great field position
9124422 when i see a certain coverage i know hell be in the right spot at the right time
9124423 this is by far the most special team ive been around in my five years here the attitude the enthusiasm the athletic ability the speed the strength were so much better in every category across the board
9124424 i talked to my father and my mom all the time and they tell me i couldnt be in a more perfect situation i came here not knowing what to expect and look what i got out of it i became an all american i graduated who could ask for a better ending
9124425 i want to make love to you right now on this table while we eat this corn or we could just eat this corn
9124426 if someone told me id be running a half marathon
9124427 it would have been a punch line to a joke
9124428 its always safer in politics to avoid risk but i didnt get into government to do the safe things the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reasons and the right reason is to challenge the status
9124429 shes got the grit integrity good sense and a fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today shes fought oil companies and party bosses and do nothing and anyone who puts their interests before the interests of the people she swore an oath to serve she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9124430 if mccain needed a running mate who would shore up his ties to the conservative base and to working women he did both picking palin pushes a lot of buttons and gives mccain credibility he might not have had with any other running mate
9124431 mccain has always been full of surprises and the nomination of
9124432 conservatives are thrilled with the selection of sarah she is a real deal conservative down the line on all of the issues
9124433 it seems to me that theres a kind of hear no progress in iraq see no progress in iraq and most of all speak of no progress in iraq
9124434 if you have an important point to make dont try to be subtle or clever use a pile driver hit the point once then come back and hit it again then hit it a third time a tremendous whack
9124435 a wise mans heart directs him towards the right but the foolish mans heart directs him towards the left
9124436 i dont know about you but i have had it with the d c democrats had it with the dlc democrats had it with every calculating equivocating triangulating straddling hair splitting son of a bitch up there and that includes hillary rodham clinton
9124437 the road to hell like the road to its sister city washington d c is paved with good intentions
9124438 republicans have a post 9 11 worldview and many democrats have a pre 9 11 worldview that doesnt make them unpatriotic not at all but it does make them wrong deeply and profoundly and consistently wrong
9124439 when the eagles are silent the parrots begin to jabber
9124440 the first amendment of the constitution was not written to protect the people of this country from religious values it was written to protect religious values from government tyranny
9124441 today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the right of all who wish to be free
9124442 i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts
9124443 the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure
9124444 i have sworn before the alter of god eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man
9124445 the only stable state is the one in which men are equal before the law
9124446 my ears are definitely opened to listen if they need a proven backup for aaron rodgers
9124447 em plena luz do dia a gente v as pessoas assaltando num lugar movimentado desinibidamente sem temor isso um absurdo

9124483 i think period jewellery has become increasingly collectible in the last 10 years great examples of period jewellery are now considered fine examples of art with prices that are multiples of the intrinsic value of the jewels
9124484 the choker made by jewellers van cleef and arpels in 18 carat gold and inlaid with precious stones was purchased by prince johannes von thurn and taxis for his wife gloria during one of their visits to the country the prince was in love with india and its ancient culture
9124485 but there has been a cross flow of jewels and styles designs and jewels from india have influenced styles across europe
9124486 primarily the focus is on quality buyers want nothing but the best and with a rich history moreover all period jewellery has multiple prices because their supply is limited buyers need to be educated about period jewellery and we have been trying to project our showcase to potential buyers through brochures catalogues and exhibition dos
9124487 this year alone we sold an important diamond corsage belonging to empress eugenie wife of nepolean iii of france last year we auctioned two strings of the famed baroda pearls and a collection of magnificent jewels which were the former property of anita delgado the fifth wife of the maharaja jagjit singh of kapurthala
9124488 heritage jewellery from india has been attracting the attention of the west since the 1920s and the 1930s when leading firms like cartier started retailing antique indian jewellery as well as incorporating elements of old jewellery in their latest designs

9124500 governor palin is a tough executive who has demonstrated during her time in office that she is ready to be president she has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9124501 she is shooting now we are not giving any specifics on her character
9124502 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms

9124506 shouldnt be a trooper ive tried to explain to him you cant head hunt like this what you need to do is back off because if the trooper does make a mistake and it is a terminable offense it can look like political interference
9124507 i think hes emotionally committed in trying to see that his former brother in law is punished
9124508 undercuts one of the points they are making that she is an ethical reformer
9124509 i have yet to hear any current senator explain how obama changed some important piece of legislation in fundamental ways or stood up to the democratic caucus on some major issue about which he and his party disagreed or worked to bring about some compromise that would have been impossible without his efforts
9124510 if you dont think that counts as a remarkable accomplishment and demonstration of executive power you dont know the first thing about politics
9124511 w won 2 national elections does that make him a great president

9124515 today i learned more about her that i like and more about her that i dont like e g her view on abortion and her ridiculous and embarrassing approach to creationism
9124516 i dont think there should be a prohibition against debate if it comes up in class it doesnt have to be part of the curriculum
9124517 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs

9124527 a reporter bumped into them at a south mumbai hotel where shoaib malik was staying when they ventured into a beauty parlour in the lobby sayali of course is instantly recognisable but shoaib pretended to be somebody else when he realised that he had been well caught the pakistani cricketer gamely signed autographs for hotel staff
9124528 we need more time because we are just getting to know each other its not easy especially when he is in pakistan its so flattering he makes
9124529 further when he was asked about the recent visits to india he responds
9124530 ive got a whole bunch of family from jefferson that run their mouths
9124531 i really hope to fill bohanans position i was pumped and ready
9124532 the thing about him is everyone sees how athletic he is but they dont see how good of a kid he is
9124533 he won that position for us hes one of the smartest guys on this football team
9124534 i think our pace threw them off a little bit
9124535 there were times where they couldnt even get lined up our kids executed well
9124536 we are just not a quick scoring offense its 3 1 2 yards at a time its hard to come back like that
9124537 im a senior i need another chance we really wanted to get revenge on them for last year
9124538 the group 70 foundation fund is a donor advised fund at hawaii community foundation it is unique because it is funded by employee contributions so management steps back and employees select the organizations
9124539 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community
9124540 group 70 foundation is unique because management steps back and employees run the program
9124541 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community
9124542 when we formed group 70 foundation we collectively wished to demonstrate our commitment to building better communities in hawaii beyond our professional services our priority is to give back to hawaii our home the foundation is a testimony to our shared values of generosity civic duty service and philosophy we are pleased to once again have such a worthy group of recipients each of whom contributes to a sustainable hawaii in their own way
9124543 i feel very fortunate to be part of an organization that gives so much back to the community i especially appreciate it because of organizations like the y after school art programs and community centers that had helped keep me out of trouble and encouraged me in the right direction ive always imagined that one day id set up some sort of a trust or scholarship program to give back however since im not in a position to do so right now i am happy that i have the group 70 foundation to help me fulfill some of that dream
9124544 well shes an amazing girl and anybody would be lucky to be dating her
9124545 if it can be written or thought it can be filmed
9124546 if it can be written or thought it can be filmed

9124548 we are here because angelo also known as lil demon got invited to do an exhibition match

9124550 he demonstrated a lot of the beats that was unknown to him and he came up with all these beats and rhythms so were like maybe we should get him a new set and see how he performs
9124551 the challenge is to get a five year old kid to sit and listen closely enough to understand the fine points and josh has that capacity i cant imagine a five year old of being able to pay attention that long

9124554 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9124555 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9124556 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9124557 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9124558 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9124559 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

9124565 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and to pass them on to the next generation because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them
9124566 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me theres a pervasive sense i think that this country as wealthy and powerful as we are still dont spend enough time thinking about the least of us
9124567 but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but through deeds the expectations i think that god has for us and that means thinking about the least of these it means acting well acting justly and loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
9124568 well you know i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
9124569 whoever harms one of these little ones it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned in the depth of the sea

9124576 intaxication euphoria at getting a tax refund which lasts until you realize it was your money to start with
9124577 lets have a toast to intaxification and to all the stimulus checks that we will receive in the years to come
9124578 hey it never was my money as i owe more than i can pay and creditors have first lien it was the money of somebody else and yet it belonged to yet someone else and then to someone else on and so on until you find that at the end it was the banks money its all the banks money in the final analysis hahaha
9124579 as always the lesson of political history is the same save us from our saviors
9124580 why are we on the borders of russia provoking the russians
9124581 we should endorse the principle but not send troops and money
9124582 now the russians are doing the same thing its this total inconsistency
9124583 this convention which i routinely dub a holes at the j hole still makes me smile because it so perfectly describes my disdainful and highly scornful dahs attitude towards them all because of their complete and utter failure cauf
9124584 the fed chairmans last speech delivered appropriately enough in a hole was on maintaining stability
9124585 wall street on life support until it wakes up into a nightmarish world of tighter regulation the central thrust of his jackson hole address
9124586 banking on recession hammering commodity prices enough to see off the inflationary threat posed by negative real interest rates at home and looser monetary conditions in emerging markets
9124587 he and his news crew were standing on public sidewalks covering an event of public significance and performing a press function protected by the first amendment
9124588 frankly we are outraged at the conduct of the individual officers their interactions with mr eslocker are captured on tape
9124589 arresting a reporter for simply doing his job is both unconstitutional and un american
9124590 that free speech is curtailed during the democratic national convention underscores the need for continued protection of civil liberties regardless of the party in power
9124591 the use of unnecessary force and the arrest of a journalist who was reporting an important political story is deeply troubling and unacceptable
9124592 the denver police department is committed to looking into each and every allegation of unnecessary force
9124593 one instance with the media shouldnt paint the entire event
9124594 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses
9124595 its something i dont think anyone has ever done before
9124596 have i ever had a reason for why i do what i do im having fun
9124597 it said to whom it may concern charles couldnt be at work because his daughter had to have a heart transplant
9124598 if it made sense for one stretch id have no problem doing that
9124599 ive shown in my career when im healthy i can get people out and i havent missed enough time where i feel cobwebs
9124600 its fun to watch especially for that city and knowing everything theyve been through there
9124601 we were supposed to be terrible this year and not able to compete
9124602 the inspiration was that we needed to find a way to compete with all these teams that were bigger faster and quicker than us
9124603 it wasnt like we looked at the rule book and said heres the scrimmage kick formation loophole and now lets create an offense around it the scrimmage kick unlocked the key to make it work
9124604 three hundred pound linemen are useless against the a 11
9124605 i wasnt sure it would work and it really didnt work at the beginning of the year but then it began to click you get a lot of receivers out there and we all get a lot of playing time and its a lot of fun
9124606 theres a big aura around football that its a tough mans sport
9124607 we have tough guys but theyre small the a 11 is for small schools with athletic guys and thats what we have
9124608 either we say nothing and we totally just hog and hoard all the information or we share it with everybody in our coaching fraternity it was the best decision because were learning from coaches all over the country at all different levels
9124609 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9124610 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

9124626 prince harry has made no secret of the fact he wants to be there when the regiment returns to the front line next year
9124627 he said the experience of leading his men into battle is one he hopes he can repeat and with one mission under his belt he has the skills and experience which will make him an extremely valuable member of the battle group
9124628 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9124629 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9124630 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9124631 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9124632 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9124633 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9124634 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9124635 who are open to doing something on the production side
9124636 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9124637 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9124638 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9124639 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9124640 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9124641 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9124642 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9124643 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9124644 a daniel ortega le pido que se mire en un espejo y me diga qu es lo que encontrar en l si le da verg enza al menos que tenga la valent a de pedir perd n si no lo pide si no levanta la voz para clamar l mismo contra la condena de ernesto cardenal sabremos que sus m ritos humanos y pol ticos han ca do a cero
9124645 se dej corromper por los rencores y las envidias del poder
9124646 una vez m s una revoluci n ha sido traicionada desde dentro
9124647 pero su nombre ernesto cardenal no es un partido electoral su nombre y su accionar est n ligados a los mejores tiempos de la nicaragua revolucionaria y su investidura merece mucha m s consideraci n y reverencia
9124648 usted ostenta la medalla jos mart y m ltiples condecoraciones culturales de la revoluci n cubana es por tanto un pedacito de ella
9124649 por lo cual siento verg enza ajena de que alg n dirigente del emblem tico frente sandinista de liberaci n nacional quiera acusarlo de cualquier cosa
9124650 si hubiese estado en nicaragua lo hubiese acompa ado con mucho honor y lo hubiese hecho en nombre de la revoluci n cubana que lo quiere tanto

9124654 i appreciate all that i was able to learn and do on this unit but that it is time to move toward a new opportunity and new challenges
9124655 there is a difference as ive said adebayor was committed first and he kept his word he said if i have a choice i want to stay and from the outside i only read the newspaper that doesnt look to be the case with berbatov
9124656 it looks like he wants a move so you are in a different situation when a player says to you i always want to stay you are not in a situation where if he doesnt go i have a problem
9124657 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9124658 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum
9124659 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low

9124662 o time jogou muito bem contra o vila nova ent o n o hora de mudan as mas sim de deixar essa equipe jogar e mostrar o seu trabalho
9124663 n s precisamos ter muita calma nesse momento o grupo continua unido e precisar ficar assim
9124664 n o d para ir de qualquer jeito preciso estudar o advers rio atacar mas sem ser de maneira desorganizada
9124665 se a ponte for determinada e estiver muito concentrada conseguir a recupera o temos que ser humildes e reencontrar o caminho das vit rias como j fizemos antes e mandar a press o para outro lado
9124666 cuando el mundo estaba en guerra habia solo un lugar seguro y ese era el subterraneo
9124667 a year ago people were thinking it was an easy group but we ended up having to win our last three games to progress
9124668 now we know psv we know marseille and we also know atletico madrid really well and that is the reason we are well aware of how difficult it will be
9124669 atletico madrid are the kind of team that are most similar to liverpool because of the fans
9124670 the fans are really good always backing the team and offering support so it will be a tough game when we go to play in the vicente calderon
9124671 they have players with quality like luis garcia and florent sinama pongolle who we know well
9124672 o jogador se apresentou ao clube com a documenta o incompleta quando a negocia o foi acertada mandamos a rela o dos documentos para seu empres rio mas ele chegou a fortaleza sem o pedido de visto de trabalho que deveria ser requisitado na bol via

9124674 o presidente evandro leit o tinha conversado comigo h cerca de 40 dias e disse que iria acertar tudo com o uniclinic assim que acabasse a s rie b e iria propor um contrato de tr s anos com co ear

9124681 the best deed before allah is the most persistent one albeit small
9124682 were awesome man thats what makes it all the more frustrating the guys put together a great rally and i didnt go shut them down if you dont score any runs you chalk it up to good starting pitching on the other side we battled against a good starting pitcher and scored what seven runs that makes it more frustrating that i couldnt hold them
9124683 its hard for me to lay my head on the pillow at night and blame someone else if i stay on my approach i have a better chance for success i got away from my approach tonight
9124684 was to come back and tie the game against a tough pitcher and self destruct with some sloppy play that did us in tonight definitely
9124685 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9124686 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9124687 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9124688 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9124689 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9124690 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9124691 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9124692 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9124693 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9124694 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9124695 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9124696 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9124697 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9124698 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9124699 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9124700 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9124701 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9124702 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9124703 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9124704 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9124705 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9124706 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9124707 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9124708 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9124709 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9124710 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9124711 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9124712 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9124713 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9124714 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9124715 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9124716 aben oa senhor as fam lias am m aben oa senhor a minha tamb m
9124717 bezerra de menezes o di rio de um esp rito
9124718 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9124719 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9124720 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9124721 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9124722 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9124723 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9124724 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9124725 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9124726 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9124727 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9124728 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9124729 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9124730 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9124731 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9124732 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9124733 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9124734 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9124735 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9124736 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9124737 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9124738 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9124739 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9124740 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9124741 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9124742 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9124743 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9124744 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9124745 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9124746 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9124747 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9124748 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9124749 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9124750 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9124751 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9124752 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9124753 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9124754 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9124755 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9124756 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9124757 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9124758 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9124759 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9124760 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9124761 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9124762 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9124763 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9124764 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9124765 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9124766 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9124767 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9124768 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9124769 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9124770 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9124771 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9124772 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9124773 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9124774 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9124775 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9124776 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9124777 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9124778 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9124779 estamos ante el inicio de una nueva etapa de la universidad

9124784 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9124785 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9124786 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9124787 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9124788 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9124789 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9124790 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9124791 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9124792 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9124793 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9124794 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9124795 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9124796 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

9124810 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9124811 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9124812 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9124813 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9124814 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9124815 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9124816 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9124817 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9124818 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9124819 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9124820 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9124821 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9124822 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9124823 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9124824 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9124825 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9124826 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9124827 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9124828 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9124829 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9124830 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9124831 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9124832 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9124833 no one works for someone we all just work together
9124834 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9124835 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9124836 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9124837 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9124838 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9124839 but he said this project really looked like it was doable

9124853 es una historia sencilla vine detr s de una mujer mi primera esposa era mexicana los dos estudi bamos en londres y all nos conocimos fue una sorpresa volar de noche sobre la ciudad de m xico es algo de lo m s impresionante que yo he visto de un pa s hasta hoy en d a no me olvido de esa imagen
9124854 en esa fecha la ciudad ten a como tres millones y medio de habitantes y el mismo n mero de rosales plantados por doquier investigu y me dijeron que por cada persona que naci en la ciudad plantaron un rosal guadalajara era una ciudad con mucha est tica con una tranquilidad fina y acogedora adem s de la belleza de las mujeres nacidas aqu avenida la paz era de lo m s precioso el tr fico era tranquilo y pod a caminarse por todos lados
9124855 no hay que lamentar siempre las cosas hay que decir que por algo pasan con una cierta planeaci n se puede regresar a lo que eran antiguamente como la ciudad de las rosas algo negativo es el transporte p blico es un servicio fatal yo me doy ciertos lujos uno de ellos es no tener coche poca gente me entiende pero no soy esclavo del auto ni del reloj desde el d a que entr a m xico no llevo reloj pero de todos modos llego puntual tampoco necesito un celular se es mi concepto de vivir

9124873 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9124874 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

9124887 the keyboard is mightier than the sword even a blogger can no longer tolerate the quality of governance that the country is having now
9124888 a lot of people have come alive in the last 10 years theyre the reformasi generation and they think about politics in fundamentally different ways
9124889 i think a lot of people feel that jeff oois following has diminished because of his direct participation in politics

9124893 we did not kill up to 90 civilians as has been alleged
9124894 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men 15 other villagers were wounded or otherwise injured
9124895 the afghan people and the afghan government have lost their patience
9124896 we cannot see our children being killed in our villages or the killing of innocent people and our hope and strong request is to reach a new agreement with the international community which clarifies all the conditions so that in the future the fight against terrorism should happen in the boundary of law so that civilians are not affected
9124897 the prospect of codifying the ad hoc rules under which u s forces have operated in afghanistan since late 2001 sends shudders through the bush administration
9124898 so youd have a multiplicity of players on that side
9124899 to us and the u s and afghan troops we were covering it appeared as though they were victorious
9124900 this is the law that would make it at the supreme court if planned parenthood assaults this law in south dakota we are ready there is money being raised for the legal costs to fight this all the way

9124902 it is reasonable to expect it to win on the ballot

9124909 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements
9124910 through our contacts with these groups we have managed to challenge the idea that hezbollah is a dogmatic terrorist islamist organization and convince part of the international left that we can be a strong partner
9124911 we think of the sacrifices of all the militants in lebanon and palestine and the arab world from islamists to nationalists to arabists or any ideological background they come from
9124912 hezbollah is aware today of the importance of cultivating contacts with the west
9124913 social forums are open spaces of discussion they present an opportunity for a group like hezbollah to participate and give their opinions
9124914 it was a potent symbol that right makes might and that a guerrilla ready to fight for its people can succeed
9124915 some leftist groups refuse to consider what islamist organizations are about their oppressive practices their violations of rights their dogmatic rhetoric

9124957 unilaterally add a warning on a drug so long as the drug manufacturer has reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard with a drug
9124958 arguably glaxo possessed such reasonable evidence of an association between paxil and pediatric suicidality as early as 1998 at the conclusion of their own studies 329 and 377 the data from which initially triggered the fdas concerns
9124959 the mere fact that glaxo elected not to submit the results of those studies until april of 2002 when it filed a supplemental nda seeking approval of an indication for pediatric use does not detract from the fact that it may have had reasonable evidence of a hazard prior to that time the mere fact that the fda had not ordered glaxo to include this warning prior to 2002 does not mean that it could not have legally done so

9124970 i can say ive been fairly happy about my play since the u s open before the u s open i wasnt very happy at all
9124971 i started playing better then and played well at john deere had a chance to win there and just didnt quite put it together on sunday but overall its been okay like i say since the u s open
9124972 i really particularly didnt drive it that well but i made a couple of key putts a couple par saves early and i actually missed a couple of really short putts as well
9124973 i think i missed about a three and a half footer on 16 and i had 4 iron into 18 and just hit it in the greenside bunker and didnt make birdie then there was another one somewhere that i really felt like i should have made and didnt but overall i putted pretty well and hit my irons well and just feel like i need to hit a few more fairways throughout the week

9124998 there are rental housing opportunities available but landlords are deciding that certain individuals need not apply even though they can demonstrate that they have the income to pay the rent
9124999 landlords are refusing apartments to people because some or all of their income may come from sources such as a government program or an alimony check legislator jenkins and i are introducing this legislation to remove this significant barrier to housing for some residents

9125055 but since he zardari is a public figure contesting a public office the office of supreme commander of the armed forces who has his hand on the nuclear trigger who is also chairman of the nuclear command authority it is legitimate for the people of pakistan to ask whether that story is true or not and what is his response
9125056 we moved the ball offensively very well and thats a credit to our offensive line
9125057 erik did a good job clearing things out our defense did a good job handling their speed
9125058 theyd tell us 10 more minutes and then lightning would strike again then theyd say we were going to warm up and then we wouldnt
9125059 we were up 21 0 and let them back in it but i thought we would have momentum after the break
9125060 it was tough sitting in there not knowing if youd get a chance to come back and get the win
9125061 late in the second quarter we realized we were better
9125062 they earned the opportunity to win this football game its a new era of sand creek football
9125063 i knew we could win after that first drive when we came out and did what we knew we could do
9125064 we slowed down but i knew we had to keep pushing
9125065 the defense stepped up and got us the ball back i knew we could keep rolling
9125066 im not happy with the way we played in the second half but at times i saw some really good things
9125067 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
9125068 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain

9125078 iran radical islamic government known sponsors of terrorism developing nuclear capabilities to generate power but threatening to eliminate israel
9125079 obama says iran is a tiny country doesnt pose a serious threat
9125080 terrorism destroying israel those arent serious threats obama dangerously unprepared to be president
9125081 and ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the berlin wall
9125082 now that has to be the kind of approach that we take you know iran they spend one one hundredth of what we spend on the military if iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us they wouldnt stand a chance and we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen that doesnt mean we agree with them on everything we might not compromise on any issues but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest and we can reduce some of the tensions that has caused us so many problems around the world
9125083 has the potential to end widespread hunger in drought prone areas of sub saharan africa
9125084 land degradation is particularly acute in sub saharan africa where the soil has been overused coupled with low unpredictable rainfall
9125085 with microdosing they dont invest much and that reduces their risk
9125086 reports indicate that land degradation affects more than half of sub saharan africa leading to loss of an estimated 42 billion dollars in income and five million hectares 12 5 million acres of productive land each year
9125087 the majority of farmlands suffer from poor soil fertility due to poor farming techniques nutrient deficiency and lack of water
9125088 thousands of successful experiments across the dryland areas of west and southern africa demonstrate that microdosing can boost yields enough to eliminate the need for food aid
9125089 bats are fascinating animals which are sadly under threat in the uk largely due to the destruction of habitats and loss of roosts
9125090 european bat weekend is an ideal way for people to learn more about the problems facing bats and to find out how they can help
9125091 bat walks offer people a truly magical way of seeing and hearing bats in their natural environment the bat conservation trust is happy to be able to share this experience with so many people
9125092 the importance of bats as a group species and as an indicator of the health of the rest of our wildlife is not always recognised which is why the bat conservation trusts work to raise the profile of these unique animals is so valuable
9125093 looking at the preliminary data so far it looks as if the antarctica ozone hole of 2008 in size and severity will be something in between the record 2006 and the much weaker one in 2007
9125094 we have in 50 years turned our ocean into a plastic soup
9125095 the solution we think is to end the age of disposable plastic
9125096 these are not innocent little bits of confetti theyre poison pills they are like sponges for pollutants
9125097 we need to clean up our own house before we tell other people to stop sending rubbish to our beaches and shores

9125111 thou shalt not have any god before me thou shalt not worship false idols or carve graven images
9125112 oh no the symbol of my god is being mocked time to flip out
9125113 this decision to keep the statue there is totally unacceptable it is a grave offense to our catholic population
9125114 the world is in decline our culture is sick our morals are being degraded and this is exemplified by a mockery of christ in our local museum
9125115 our culture is infected with jews gypsies and bolsheviks that is why you are standing in a line with a bag of money hoping to afford a loaf of bread and that same infection of culture is seen in these artworks
9125116 alois lageder the museums president said the decision to continue to display the statue was made to safeguard the autonomy of art institutions
9125117 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
9125118 it has left the whole family in darkness this episode just because of some i dont know some foolish mistakes from some person
9125119 i crawled into the car through the back window and tried to help her the seat belt was cutting into her skin and she was asking to have it taken off i told her we needed to keep still until help got here
9125120 it should have been me going to make that return
9125121 a good woman and puts everybody elses needs in front of hers she takes care of her kids and grandkids better than anybody i know she takes care of everybody
9125122 i was stunned and i was honored to be chosen the winner
9125123 when he came for the opening of the school he had the kids on the edge of their seats
9125124 failure by the caregiver to provide for the appropriate health care of the child although financially able to do so or offered financial or other means to do so
9125125 it was like a cat and mouse game with our case worker
9125126 the next call we got was from cuyahoga that he passed away
9125127 this is not a mother who wasnt bonded to her kids i cant believe that any parent would allow their child to suffer and die
9125128 prioritize their childrens medical appointments and medical needs above all other things

9125132 these expenses include the surgery itself hospital check ups and medications gonzalez will take for the rest of his life anti rejection pills and immunosuppressants
9125133 were concerned we might hit the max amount for insurance

9125135 we want to get out the word dont wait until it happens to care
9125136 we wanted to have a variety of different things so everyone could get involved
9125137 he would go to the store on a 10 minute trip and be gone for a couple of hours
9125138 the doctors are pleased at how well he is bouncing back
9125139 i think that as soon as hes ready to go hell do it
9125140 you know nasas 50th anniversary i think really does sort of date me because i was there at the beginning of that
9125141 people have contributed so much to that 50 year period its just amazing
9125142 i can tell you dont bree i can tell from you face and everything
9125143 raul has been as hot as anybody ive ever seen
9125144 for a month hes hitting over 380 thats just ridiculous
9125145 you play so many games they all kind of run together so i dont worry about what month it is or whatever
9125146 i just try to go out there and prepare and compete every day
9125147 my thought during the course of the game was that i could see why these guys have won 10 straight
9125148 were throwing what we all feel like down the road is going to be one of the top pitchers in baseball and theyre threatening every inning theyre making life miserable for him out there
9125149 i made the pitches when i had to to get out of the inning but not even one inning was easy for me
9125150 he got in some jams and was able to get the ground ball when we needed to
9125151 just being able to repeat my delivery is the key thing and being able to get ahead is always huge
9125152 i still remember everything about that coming here and what was going through my head and everything
9125153 it doesnt seem like that long ago to be honest its funny to think about how much has changed since then
9125154 when i got here today it felt like just yesterday i was here for the first time when i got called up
9125155 but we got a lot of new guys its definitely different than before
9125156 when richie and vidro were let go that brought a couple of new guys up the two left handers cesar jimenez and jake woods who were in the minors a lot of them have already been here so theres just not that many more names that wed consider
9125157 im pretty sure about four or five names but if theres anybody more than that i dont know exactly who it will be
9125158 so the chick in the dress is actually a dude and the dude in a dress is actually a chick any questions
9125159 id look prettier than you even if you were a festering corpse
9125160 i like to dance in the rain wearing nothing but an old shower curtain and a tea cozy
9125161 thats nice but i asked what your previous job experience was
9125162 enough talking theres only enough bullets left to take out
9125163 oh i loved it the only problem was your story
9125164 he had an aura of danger about him not the oh how cool is he kind of danger but the one step closer and you will be missing a body part kind of danger

9125169 they sort of cut the muffin for you but its up to you to slide a small knife in there to finish the job
9125170 really for real my profanity is the worst thing going on here
9125171 certainly has the possibility of giving her an ethical black eye
9125172 de keuze was al eerder gemaakt dat ik in spanje zou debuteren ik weet absoluut niet wat me te wachten staat en zie wel wat er gebeurt het zal zwaar worden maar wie weet kan ik een ritje winnen dat zou al heel mooi zijn
9125173 als hij gezond blijft moet robert in staat zijn bij de eerste twintig van het klassement te eindigen maar het grootste doel voor ons is een rit winnen met gesink en oscar freire hebben we daar twee troeven voor
9125174 voor dit jaar heeft astana met contador kl den en leipheimer de nummer een twee en drie van het podium lijkt me
9125175 oranje zag er goed uit was heel solide en stabiel kreeg veel kansen en had makkelijk kunnen winnen
9125176 natuurlijk denk je hadden we in zwitserland niet kunnen winnen maar het is heel moeilijk vergelijken omdat de russen op het ek in goede vorm waren en een oefenduel niet te vergelijken is met de wedstrijd op het ek
9125177 ik had dingen achteraf niet anders gedaan voor de zaak boulahrouz was geen jurisprudentie wij speelden een slechte wedstrijd en hij wilde graag in actie komen de ploeg en technische staf stonden daarachter
9125178 het niveau van de groep is beter dan ik bij binnenkomst verwachtte er zijn veel jonge jongens met veel potentie dat stemt me tevreden maar in principe zijn we nog ver verwijderd van het niveau waar we naartoe willen
9125179 het is leuk ik heb weer dagelijks met spelers te maken en dat voelt goed daarnaast sta ik midden in het bedrijf ben ik voortdurend bezig met allerlei gevarieerde zaken
9125180 we trainen deze periode vaak twee keer en tussendoor komen allerlei organisatorische zaken bij me langs neem maar van mij aan dat ik het druk zat heb en de verantwoordelijkheid groot is er zijn veel zaken waar ik mijn mening over moet geven waar ik iets van moet vinden nu ben ik nog een beetje zoekende komt iedereen wat vragen daar moet ik nu structuur in gaan aanbrengen
9125181 zeist is vaak het pispaaltje van het voetbal maar dat is niet terecht ik heb vier jaar lang met ontzettend veel plezier bij de knvb gewerkt de bond heeft het qua organisatie heel goed voor elkaar de faciliteiten zijn uitstekend en de kwaliteiten van de mensen groot op elk gebied maar bij ajax vind ik het wel leuker de be nvloeding van spelers is veel groter doordat ik ze elke dag tot mijn beschikking heb
9125182 spelers hebben samenspel nodig om tot goede resultaten te komen wij om goede beslissingen te nemen daarom voer ik veelvuldig overleg uiteindelijk ben ik echter degene die beslist of we links of rechtsaf gaan ik ben tevreden over hoe het gaat al kunnen dingen altijd beter een apart trainingscentrum is ideaal daar moeten we van blijven dromen
9125183 the upper east side mothers approach was unorthodox to put it mildly
9125184 there was no hesitation no words he just made this aeeeh sound
9125185 i would say that its hard to claim self defense when you bring a gun to a situation
9125186 shes just like every other mom in america i think its an absolutely brilliant choice
9125187 a lot of different people are going to take additional looks at this team
9125188 i would have hoped the person they selected would have some firsthand knowledge of that body
9125189 given her commitment to stand up for life i think she rounds the ticket out very nicely
9125190 we need to promote more women who are pro life they are the best advocates for the issue
9125191 i think she brings some great experience and energy to the ticket and shes a mom
9125192 but as a former hillary supporter i am not swayed ill be voting for the obama biden ticket
9125193 its everything its game week its preparing for a game its getting mentally focused for a game its knowing everything is possible then theres the hotel the walk through then we get here and do the gator walk here then we prepare for the game at the swamp then we go play
9125194 the atmosphere i love the crowd the team theres something about game day that keeps you going
9125195 i love running out on the field going against an opponent before the game i love the whole experience of driving over here as a freshman i actually cried a little bit when i first drove over here the gator walk its all a great experience
9125196 the gator walk something about that is just overwhelming that youre here at florida i never thought id be here coming down and seeing all the fans here thats when you know its game time
9125197 just the atmosphere of the whole game being here in gator nation has really made me even more anxious to play in the games because ive been here in the fall and seen what the atmosphere is like its one of the craziest atmospheres around
9125198 as doc rivers said during champions day youre investing youre investing and then you go withdraw its your pay day and obviously were awfully fortunate for playing where we get to play thats why kids come here to play in games like this
9125199 you get to go out and hit someone else you practice so long and youve met for so long now you wait through spring ball and now is the time to see what they really can do and you have a chance to watch them its just fun to see if youve really prepared them and they are ready to go play for you
9125200 its a culmination of a lot of work when you get to game day its like lets go play and game day should be easier than practice and thats really the mantra for us what we go by work work work push em push em push em game day enjoy it because its not going to be anything like practice is its going to be a lot more fun
9125201 america comes alive when college football season starts we all know that i cant wait weve been out here in the winter and the spring and the summer and walk throughs and ive never been here on game day but this is what its all about the enthusiasm the passion the emotion the students the fans ive seen this place on television ive lost track of how many times ive watched florida on tv and i finally get to walk out here as a coach its pretty special
9125202 just running in the stadium the crowd the electricity that flows around this place theres nothing like it
9125203 you get up early watch espn and read the gainesville sun and there is this buzz in the air from the grocery store to the gas station to the stadium its also about me overestimating the time i need to be tailgating and always getting to the stadium way too early
9125204 game day is game weekend for us friday night we go downtown and walk around we eat there and see people we know saturday we go to publix and then park and go to the gator walk we go to emerson hall and tijuana flats and then into the stadium its a ritual there is so much energy in gainesville and its great to see the gator nation come together
9125205 its family fun and fellowship we get to our parking at 8 with a bunch of friends no matter what time the game is we have the tailgate catered its grown into a huge production whats great is my two daughters who are 14 and 11 cant wait that gives me goose bumps ill tell you those seven saturdays are probably my favorite seven days of the year
9125206 it means i get to fly my orange and blue plane to gainesville stay at magnolia plantation and go the game early so were in our seats when they go here come the gators the great thing about going to gainesville is that i get a year older and they stay the same age there are two kinds of game days the blowouts and the tight games im a ball of nerves for the big games i love the blowouts
9125207 it means everything i grew up in gainesville and theres just nothing else like it its exciting theres a look in everybodys eyes its an intangible feeling that is difficult to describe i love it
9125208 its one of those messages that have value in showing you can do anything you want to do
9125209 the more we did that the more we made people understood that there arent too many differences
9125210 we had to have defense mechanisms and we had to have our defenses up
9125211 they werent hitting or pushing but theyd come at you in a different way
9125212 those were the days when civil rights workers were being attacked and in some cases murdered in the southeast
9125213 i said ill stay back somebody needs to come get you guys
9125214 i think the movement in the 70s created a path for much of the progress thats taken place
9125215 i think it was the only time that the pressure got to me
9125216 i was quite young then just starting and i couldnt understand it
9125217 if nothing else it showed i had the ability to get it done
9125218 im saying this one time i do not repeat myself look at me take everything out of your hands and listen
9125219 you know everything you know to be a sixth grader that is why you are here you passed the test and you are here this year we are learning how to be a seventh grader you will need all of the skills i am teaching you to be a sucessful seventh grader
9125220 best be certain im dead first or youll limp away missing a far dearer organ
9125221 i nicol bolas the most powerful of all planeswalkers will now display my power by attacking argh why is my face melting
9125222 someone help me i got stabbed and i wasnt stabbed before
9125223 no im pretty sure i just dont like being stabbed
9125224 try it for a little while you might like it
9125225 ill pitch this squee and return tarmogoyf to my hand
9125226 we put together our best effort so far this season
9125227 we worked hard for the whole 90 minutes and were more physical than we had been previously which is a big reason for getting the win tonight
9125228 jessica made a nice turn on the left side and shot it to the far post in the upper corner
9125229 we actually had more chances to take a bigger lead but overall i am pleased with the effort
9125230 bad memory of past events and happenings regardless of significance
9125231 crosis is the eye of the ur dragon piercing illusion and darkness
9125232 darigaaz is the breath of the ur dragon burning away the burdens of mortality
9125233 dromar is the wings of the ur dragon sweeping away all opposition
9125234 rith is the claw of the ur dragon scattering seeds of devastation
9125235 after i used it for three days all of my acne dried up and went away
9125236 it is very effective some people dont believe in it but people who do really get a good result
9125237 what you mean during combat i can spend about 6 seconds to recover but outside of combat when i have plenty of time to recuperate im unable to recover
9125238 you can live without an arm they can always bolt on a new one
9125239 i love this guy hell make such great target practice
9125240 if i wanted to tell you i would wouldnt i
9125241 youve got me i hate that shirt in fact i think youre a crummy dresser period
9125242 there are certain schools that i am not going to name that we dont have anything in common with other than we play football and we are division i schools if i named them that would be wrong
9125243 we dont go out of our way to schedule them
9125244 but there are certain schools and i have named a few that i think we have certain things in common with
9125245 other times you play teams and they would write stupid things in the paper about your team and your school and they will attack what we stand for why do we want to play those games
9125246 most of the times you want to play the teams that are traditionally strong and are classy and stand for something we like that we prefer that
9125247 there was a bcs conference school that we were talking about playing
9125248 i read a little thing about how we might play them and their fans and stuff were blogging saying why should we play a non bcs team
9125249 you know these labels are fraudulent they are just labels i dont think our people or our writers would see byu as any different from any bcs team we may not be as strong as some bcs teams but i dont think you would separate us from every other bcs school
9125250 right now you are talking eight years away you schedule a team that far away you do not know what you are getting
9125251 for instance we have a game with boise state in 2015
9125252 and so it was worth playing and to get them we decided to play a four game series two home and two away
9125253 theyve integrated well with our returning players they were a huge factor
9125254 a lady in her car saw the plane and got out and ran
9125255 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms
9125256 it provides workers with benefits and salary replacement and regardless of who is at fault it provides employers with immunity from law suites in the event a worker is injured its no fault insurance
9125257 one of the largest industry sectors is the agricultural industry
9125258 we did survey some of our members and it would appear that of those that had non family members as employees roughly 15 percent were using workers compensation and then another relatively small percentage were using private industry programs that provided some coverage as well
9125259 theyre not just covered when theyre at work theyre also covered when they are off of work they could be gone playing hockey and theyre covered
9125260 if we offer a reasonable package that might attract more labour back to the farm
9125261 if you were an employee that wasnt covered under this new labour standards code youre probably not going to be required to be covered under workers compensation
9125262 for a lot of the small farms the family operated farms if theyre not bringing in labour they will still have free choice whether to go through private insurance thats fairly positive for those farms
9125263 its really important i think to get this particular piece of the regulation correct
9125264 were going to consult with the producers and the commodity groups to look at what the definition of family member means so we know who will be excluded
9125265 we would really like to see the government allow those producers to continue to use their private insurance
9125266 play only during your main phase when the stack is empty and you have priority
9125267 i dont want to talk about it whenever i have to have a conversation like this it means ive gotten to serious with a person or too close or whatever
9125268 that is what we wanted to see that was the important thing
9125269 we are ready and eager to offer the children suffering from the war in south ossetia spiritual and material aid
9125270 morir dignamente es en consecuencia una manifestaci n esencial de la vida humana es el reconocimiento hidalgo de su finitud el derecho no lo puede desconocer mucho menos cercenar
9125271 puede el derecho obligar a una persona a soportar lo insoportable a padecer crueldad a ver degradada su dignidad para aplazar por poco tiempo el fin de su vida

9125492 in my early years i assiduously followed this threefold course first i read through the entire bible three times a year eight chapters in the old testament and two in the new testament daily i steadily persevered in this for ten years in order to familiarize myself with its contents which can only be done by consecutive reading second i studied a portion of the bible each week concentrating for ten minutes or more each day on the same passage pondering the order of it the connection between each statement seeking a definition of the important terms in it looking up all the marginal references being on the look out for its typical significance third i meditated on one verse each day writing it out on a slip of paper in the morning memorizing it consulting it at odd moments through the day pondering separately each word in it asking god to open for me its spiritual meaning and to write it on my heart the verse was my food for that day meditation standing to reading as mastication does to eating the more some such method as the above be followed out the more shall we be able to say thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path ps 119 105

9125571 i started the blog but i think the movement my site touched off probably got her the coverage she needed to make mccains short list
9125572 theres one thing we ladies admire and that is a strong woman conservatives love her theres just a buzz in the air today
9125573 certainly she draws suburban women in more than another old white guy would
9125574 i admire people who are in real life who they say they are when you put them under the spotlight i was going to vote for john mccain because he wasnt barack obama now im going to vote for john mccain because im excited about his vice presidential pick
9125575 i think its an outstanding and gutsy choice shes a young governor of alaska who has already demonstrated shes not afraid to take tough stands on fiscal responsibility and developing alaskas energy resources and i think she will stand in stark contrast to the washington insider joe biden
9125576 she adds so much to the ticket in real life real world experience shes a mother shes an executive shes been on commissions shes given to her community in the pta
9125577 i think it shows that mccain is as feisty as he ever was and hes going to do the right thing its bold and its exciting and it bodes well for a mccain presidency
9125578 the republicans have made what may have been the single biggest piece of bad judgment in the history of presidential politics mccain had said this campaign was about experience and obama had said it was about judgment john mccain abandoned the experience argument and showed that he has no judgment
9125579 i think in many ways this selection may backfire on the mccain campaign itll make women mad that the mccain campaign would be so cynical as to think that by picking somebody who is so obviously unqualified that women would vote for her simply because of her gender
9125580 on wednesday biden was cutting aggressive and assertive biden has a reputation as a specialist in foreign policy and he used this authority to mount a frontal attack on mccain and the value of his oft quoted experience on the issue up to that moment the democrats had appeared to be suffering from their classic disease of election campaign uncertainty and reluctance to meet republican attacks head on it looks as though the democrats have finally grown some teeth it remains to be seen if they can be relied upon to take a good bite out of their opponents
9125581 yes he did show his teeth and he bit but only in such a way that it would still be possible for mccain to lead a respectful campaign because above all obama merely defined what kind of change he wants and said that mccain was a symbol stagnation that the nation could no longer afford obama spoke about the big issues and itll be interesting to see whether mccain will do that as well or continue with the personal attacks

9125748 the assignment will be a plan of graceful action that will lead you right into what you came to planet earth to do in regard to inaugurating your shift from fate into destiny from human nature into divine nature
9125749 everything you have done and been up to this point in your life will have prepared you for your divine assignment
9125750 if you have made space within you and made peace with no longer claiming and chasing a false identity what is meant to be yours is on its way into you unhindered by grace in what humans might call a magical way in truth it is delivery of a promise made long ago before you took on earthly form we have always had an agreement that if you did your part to remember the truth and the way of your being i would do my part for those that are awakening into a deeper and more meaningful way expect delivery each has free will to accept or reject anything know that you are each watched over not looked over and you are deeply loved

9125763 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
9125764 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
9125765 consumers pulled back on real spending in both june and july in the face of weak employment conditions higher energy prices and further declines in household net worth
9125766 we think the worst is yet to come for consumers
9125767 every morning i wake up i tell myself you have two choices today you can choose to be in a good mood or in a bad mood i choose to be in a good mood every time something bad happens i can choose to be a victim or learn from it every time someone complains to me i can choose to accept their complaint or i can choose to focus on the positive sides to life i choose the positive sides of life
9125768 life is about choices when you cut away the crap every situation is a choice you choose how to react on the situations you choose how people affect your mood it is you who choose if you want to be in a good mood or a bad mood in the end it is your choice how you live your life
9125769 if id be any better id be twins do you want to see my scars
9125770 so while i lay on the ground i remembered i had two choices i could choose to live or i could choose to die i chose to live

9125775 barajas reaccion tarde y se vio desbordado por la tragedia
9125776 los responsables del aeropuerto no pidieron asistencia m dica externa hasta 23 minutos despu s del accidente
9125777 una inmensa deslealtad y de una tomadura de pelo monumental
9125778 estos ataques demuestran la incapacidad del psoe para llegar a acuerdos con todas las comunidades aut nomas

9125781 una reformista sensata administradora del dinero de los contribuyentes y ac rrima promotora de la responsabilidad del gobierno
9125782 es otro indicio alentador de que se est n derribando barreras
9125783 encara la recta final de la campa a con la bandera del cambio
9125784 la constituci n tiene que ser sensible a los cambios
9125785 se interpretasen como una siembra de dudas o sospechas sobre la actuaci n del gobierno resisti ndose a secundar especulaciones aventuradas por algunas tribunas period sticas
9125786 no sirvi para esclarecer casi nada ya que se limit a subrayar el esfuerzo que este gobierno ha efectuado para mejorar la seguridad a rea sin abordar el asunto esencial si hay algo que se pod a haber hecho para evitar este accidente
9125787 ninguno de los diputados ten a ayer ganas de pedir explicaciones a la ministra tal vez por miedo a ser acusados de querer sacar partido de la cat strofe
9125788 hizo que no cumplieran su obligaci n de controlar la acci n del gobierno en un tema tan importante como es la seguridad a rea
9125789 la pasividad de la oposici n acrecienta la inquietud de la opini n p blica por esas graves inc gnitas sobre el accidente que siguen sin respuesta
9125790 edulcor su discurso con un innecesario tono de autocomplacencia por el funcionamiento de los servicios t cnicos
9125791 falt autocr tica por el retraso en la puesta en marcha de la agencia de seguridad a rea
9125792 no hubo explicaciones convincentes sobre las razones para que no se constituya una comisi n sobre seguridad a rea en el congreso
9125793 est n actuando con rigor y sentido de la responsabilidad sin perjuicio de exigir que se despejen todas las incertidumbres
9125794 deben convertirse en hechos tangibles para no queden s lo en palabras
9125795 hay que valorar que se reuniera el parlamento para analizar y debatir sobre una tragedia tan grave que ha conmocionado la sociedad espa ola
9125796 completa y persuasiva pero no logr despejar las dudas sobre algunos puntos oscuros en especial las referidas a la reacci n de los servicios del aeropuerto desde el segundo siguiente a la cat strofe
9125797 no logr disipar el dato m s inquietante el avi n siniestrado fue sometido a una sola inspecci n no avisada en lo que iba de a o
9125798 tal vez sea suficiente pero no es un dato para presumir
9125799 las prolijas explicaciones de la ministra que encontraron un clima de comprensi n y cooperaci n entre los portavoces de los grupos parlamentarios acreditaron que tanto en el cap tulo del rigor y la frecuencia de las inspecciones sobre las aeronaves de la compa a accidentada como en lo relativo al cumplimiento de los protocolos estipulados para situaciones de emergencia el funcionamiento de los equipos fue correcto y ajustado a la legislaci n europea
9125800 fue rocoso en la reiteraci n de mensajes ya conocidos
9125801 para ofrecer alternativas al laberinto creado por el jefe del ejecutivo con el estatuto de catalu a
9125802 no es de cifras ni de criterios de reparto sino estrictamente pol tica porque se refiere a la alteraci n del modelo de estado
9125803 ese experimento del que tanto zapatero como el resto del gobierno eran muy conscientes cuando dieron su visto bueno al estatuto catal n
9125804 fascin a sus seguidores introdujo pragmatismo a su habitual y excesiva ret rica y transmiti la sensaci n de que all hab a un l der capaz de mitigar las heridas que la dureza de las primarias hab a abierto en el bando dem crata
9125805 y eso puede ser una r mora con o sin acompa ante juvenil
9125806 mostrarse como un l der s lido capaz de poner los pies en la tierra sin dejar de ofrecer esperanza
9125807 estar por ver si lograr que el partido empiece a despegarse en las encuestas
9125808 un acertado gesto de audacia del aspirante republicano con el que hace un importante gui o al voto femenino
9125809 ha logrado un contrapeso de dimensiones hist ricas ya que se trata de la primera mujer que ocupa este puesto en el partido republicano
9125810 habr que esperar a los debates entre ambos candidatos para avizorar por d nde puede ir la cada vez m s probable presidencia de obama
9125811 los dem cratas han dado un ejemplo excepcional de unidad
9125812 una victoria de obama frente a mccain pese al entusiasmo que despierta es dif cil
9125813 resulta inconcebible que las comisar as no dispongan de bases de datos en las que figure el historial delictivo de los ciudadanos y que sea posible extender un pasaporte a un preso que est en la calle de permiso
9125814 aunque es razonable insistir en que a pesar de la desaceleraci n econ mica el gobierno seguir avanzando en sus compromisos con los derechos sociales lo urgente parece ahora revisar una estrategia para hacer frente a la crisis que hasta el momento se est demostrando escasamente operativa

9125822 we are sending supplies and volunteers to the gulf to be able to provide immediate relief when gustav hits land
9125823 theyre primarily going to louisiana but were also focusing our efforts on texas alabama and mississippi
9125824 before we had arrangements with various vendors to provide equipment like cots blankets coolers shovels and cleanup kits and we would order them when a disaster hits
9125825 what we found with katrina is that we needed a lot more reserves to make things quickly available
9125826 katrina messed up so many peoples lives i would go around and see people who only have a shell of a house and theyre left with nothing nothing to even cook and no running water
9125827 they lost what took them their whole lives to build its a tough time for them so it feels good to be able to support them and help them get back on their feet
9125828 if it werent for the volunteers wed be in a real pickle
9125829 right now the disaster relief fund for the american red cross is basically at zero because of the number of disasters we had this summer
9125830 were in the middle of a major fundraising effort right now
9125831 i cried with people i laughed with people and i got so many hugs
9125832 every emotion you can go through you pretty much go through in a disaster
9125833 everybody has a story and some of them just want to be heard it can take a big burden off their shoulders and help them make that first step back to a normal life those are the things that really make a big difference and make volunteering worthwhile

9125926 im a realist i understand promises made by politicians are not always to be taken at 100 percent
9125927 this one should have been taken at about 10 percent which is about what we got
9125928 the market has gone crazy the last four or five years but the people who have been homesteaded havent felt the brunt of that because their appraised value has been capped
9125929 those are typically new homesteads that havent had a chance to build up a cap yet
9125930 if your house is valued really high like 600 000 then that 3 percent increase is getting pretty painful

9125937 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9125938 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9125939 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9125940 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9125941 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9125942 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9125943 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9125944 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9125945 here is how you should look now make it happen
9125946 lo importante del recorrido que planteamos tiene en total 35 kil metros
9125947 el estado actual de las v as permite una velocidad promedio de 35 a 40 kil metros por hora una velocidad ptima para cumplir con eficiencia el recorrido
9125948 una vez que esto est resuelto se decidir si lo explotar la municipalidad o si lo har una empresa privada
9125949 hay que olvidarse del famoso cintur n de hierro las v as son un medio de transporte y justamente lo m s caro del sistema ferroviario lo importante es que a eso lo tenemos ahora hay que darles utilidad
9125950 la relaci n entre el uso del combustible por pasajero transportado entre el tren y el mnibus es de dos a uno
9125951 insert my name you dress too nicely to work here
9125952 ser n una oportunidad para mejorar no s lo la infraestructura deportiva sino la vialidad el transporte p blico y el urbanismo los juegos nacionales son una ocasi n inmejorable para hacer obras que perduren y hagan m s humanas a nuestras ciudades
9125953 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9125954 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9125955 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9125956 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9125957 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9125958 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9125959 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9125960 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9125961 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9125962 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9125963 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9125964 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9125965 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9125966 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9125967 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9125968 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9125969 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9125970 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9125971 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9125972 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
9125973 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
9125974 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
9125975 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
9125976 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9125977 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9125978 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
9125979 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
9125980 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
9125981 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
9125982 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9125983 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
9125984 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9125985 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9125986 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9125987 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9125988 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9125989 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9125990 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9125991 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9125992 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9125993 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9125994 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9125995 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9125996 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9125997 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9125998 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9125999 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9126000 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
9126001 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9126002 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9126003 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9126004 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
9126005 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9126006 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9126007 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9126008 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9126009 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9126010 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9126011 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

9126027 i go to the dog shows because i like to be with my dogs and other dog people i enjoy myself there and i enjoy being with people i have known and whose interests i have shared for a long time if i win thats just icing on the cake
9126028 everything good in our lives has come from the dogs including our lives together
9126029 its interesting because i think a lot of us feel the same way wanting to reject societys skinny girl ideal but falling into the trap anyway
9126030 after all the negative stuff shes getting back to her fighting weight
9126031 while i have always known that mannequins are disproportionate i was unaware of how grossly exaggerated the fake bodies are
9126032 i would have to eat a lot of crap and laze around like you people to look like you people
9126033 dont you dare take a picture of me like this
9126034 i will brook no nonsense from you buddy or you will pay
9126035 the belief ive acquired over a generous and nevertheless inadequate time on earth is that we arrive in the afterlife as broken as when we departed from the world but on the other hand ive always enjoyed a journey
9126036 in a distinct voice filled with both humor and yearning will the main character tells of a lifelong search for home the hunger for fortune and adventure the rebuilding of a trampled culture and above all an enduring pursuit of passion as he comes to realize when all else is lost and gone forever there is yearning one of the few welcome lessons age teaches is that only desire trumps time
9126037 there is no scatheless rapture love and time put me in this condition i am leaving soon for the nightland where all the ghosts of men and animals yearn to travel were called to it i feel it pulling at me same as everyone else it is the last unmapped country and a dark way getting there a sorrowful path and maybe not exactly paradise at the other end the belief ive acquired over a generous and nevertheless inadequate time on earth is that we arrive in the afterlife as broken as when we departed from the world but on the other hand ive always enjoyed a journey

9126045 securing virtual worlds against real attacks the challenges of online game development
9126046 the shift to open source scripting engines is clearly happening because it reduces the development costs and paves the way for easier integration of different games in the future
9126047 the drawback on the other hand is that a common programming language mights at some point in the future assist in creating cross game threats
9126048 as we can see web and mmog technologies are converging
9126049 given that browsers have been and continue to be plagued by severe security issues there is a significant risk that such convergence will make the attack surface on mmogs much wider than it is currently it would seem natural to assume that in the future more mmogs will be based on browsers no need to develop a client so it is much cheaper thus making malicious attacks on the online games easier attacks can use vulnerabilities in browsers and steal for instance virtual identities and commodities in addition to real ones
9126050 most of the attacks that we have witnessed in real life will surface in virtual worlds unless the environment is built with security in mind
9126051 we need to leverage our knowledge and work together security vendors and gaming vendors to avoid falling into the same trap again it is possible to make most attacks in virtual life impossible or uneconomical there are no good reasons why virtual characters should suffer from the same troubles spam phishing adware spyware trojans viruses worms and other malware that currently plague our real day to day lives
9126052 uhm could you please come over and look at my computer again

9126061 i know tapi kalau hati aku tidak mahu dengan sesiapa pun bagaimana i still want
9126062 its hard to talk to you right now like talking to a wall of brick concrete brick
9126063 you were just a fuckign back up at the end hahaha
9126064 why did you come to university what are you looking to get out of this
9126065 i hadnt planned to attend the 2000 convention i was just coming off my defeat in the democratic primary for the illinois first congressional district seat and was determined to spend most of the summer catching up on work at the law practice that id left unattended during the campaign a neglect that had left me more or less broke
9126066 at the last minute though several friends and supporters who were planning to go insisted that i join them eventually i relented and booked a flight to l a not being a delegate i couldnt secure a floor pass according to the illinois party chairman he was already inundated with requests and the best he could do was give me a pass that allowed entry only onto the convention site i ended up watching most of the speeches on various television screens scattered around the staples center occasionally following friends or acquaintances into skyboxes where it was clear i didnt belong by tuesday night i realized that my presence was serving neither me nor the democratic party any apparent purpose and by wednesday morning i was on the first flight back to chicago
9126067 what kind of job are you going to get with that

9126085 no thank you i appreciate all you have done and will do for our team
9126086 we have great fans and i love playing in this building
9126087 what i learned is we are a team who never give up
9126088 that is what we wanted to see that was the important thing
9126089 that is what we wanted to see that was the important thing
9126090 it was one of the greatest feelings of my life
9126091 theyre a decent team in fact one we were worried about coming into tonight
9126092 it is a work that begins with brahmin and buddha and ends with tao
9126093 in the shade of the house in the sunshine on the river bank by the boats
9126094 govinda bowed low he bowed low right down to the ground in front of the man sitting there motionless
9126095 like one who had awakened or was newly born had to begin his life completely afresh
9126096 is it not true that slowly and through many deviations i changed from a man into a child from a thinker into an ordinary person
9126097 a snake biting its own tail a symbol of the eternal cycle of life
9126098 suddenly stood still as if a snake lay in his path
9126099 each one obsessed by his goal each one was suffering
9126100 water never fears being divided because it knows it will flow back together in time water will always flow downward to the most stable level
9126101 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9126102 it really depends on what kind of recession it is
9126103 the first one wasnt really a manufacturing led recession and the second one was
9126104 this rate case is all about investing in reliability to provide a secure energy future for missouri
9126105 predominantly due to a realization that demand isnt going to materialize as expected
9126106 i dont think youre going to see demand come raging back
9126107 hi madonna it is great to have you here this evening
9126108 merhaba madonna bu ak am bizim aram zda olman harikad r
9126109 i believe weve become the hope for tens of thousands of people pursuing their dreams
9126110 were going to become the hope for millions of people around the world
9126111 they wanted to see that its real people and a real business
9126112 and its going to get better and better and better
9126113 well you show me any business where everybodys making money
9126114 if they will scrutinize this company and be honest not political ytb is going to come out smelling like a rose
9126115 if you have an aggressive sales person making a presentation you tend to listen to the pieces you really want to hear that you can be wealthy
9126116 but when i found out that lou brock would put his name on something like this it kind of said to me that this has got to be a real thing
9126117 but everybody ive seen get into it has lost money
9126118 there are people right now in america praying for an answer
9126119 the biggest problem in not being consolidated is you dont know how youre invested
9126120 unless youre extremely organized you tend to see the pieces not the performance of the whole portfolio
9126121 you want to make sure that each account has its own separate portfolio its own objective
9126122 youve got to do the detective work before you consolidate it
9126123 they both get it right pretty much on the average
9126124 most households are kind of living day to day or paycheck to paycheck
9126125 so theyre very aware when they get pinched like this at the grocery store and the gas pump
9126126 they often think its going to be higher than it winds up being
9126127 expected inflation is a critical variable and one of the most important variables in economics
9126128 on an individual basis it effects decisions with what people are going to be doing with their savings
9126129 but obviously with that concussion thats probably not the case
9126130 when i put my hand down i feel like a giant out there said the 300 pound sophomore whose team opens the season against mcneese state tonight
9126131 i dont care how big you are how fast you work if youre stronger than me ill outthink you if youre smart ill overpower you if youre fast im going to be quicker than you every time im out there im just going to figure out how to be better than you
9126132 im going to do whatever i can to help my team win
9126133 one of the dreams for me is to turn this thing around to be remembered as one of the guys who helped bring carolina back
9126134 youve got to have that confidence and swagger and the opponent in front of you has no chance
9126135 if youve got that youve already won and youre a step ahead
9126136 when he first got here i was like what in the world kind of monster is this
9126137 but once you got to know marvin hes funny and great to be around and hes a team player who wants this team to go to the acc championship and to bigger things the national championship
9126138 physically me and kentwan were probably on the same level in the weight room last year but he had the knowledge the experience the technique
9126139 just going out there and seeing how he practiced how he took coaching how he interacted with players and coaches and how they loved to be around him it just helped me see what i wanted to become and i where i want to go with my football career
9126140 one great thing about traveling is that you do become closer with your teammates
9126141 youre just with them for a whole trip its just you guys that definitely helps the bonding aspect of a team and i think thats going to be beneficial
9126142 being able to start practice now gets the bad taste out of our mouth from last year and look forward to a new year and get up there and play together as a team early on
9126143 we maybe strayed off on different tangents a couple of times
9126144 for the most part last year we were a team but we had some games where some guys went off and did their own things but this year i think we are on the same page
9126145 its a couple days and its just going to be us if we dont get along this trip then weve got some trouble but i think we will
9126146 it was a hard hard decision and i wouldnt even want to represent it as a clear case
9126147 the terrible error in judgment that he made and that somehow some way people would think that we thought that was ok and its not ok
9126148 i suspect that if we had not had the opportunity to work with him first hand that he would not be employed here
9126149 he wasnt hired to be a professional athlete he was hired to be a coach and teacher
9126150 what i did was 100 percent wrong theres no excusing that i know i have an obligation and duty to speak out against the use of banned substances
9126151 as a woman who is a champion of womens equality i find the pick very interesting and a maverick move
9126152 im very curious i drank the obama kool aid im into michelle obama but im excited to see another woman get attention as a vice presidential candidate
9126153 i think well have to wait and see if mccain has stolen the ball or lost the game
9126154 i dont think they did it out of a sense of strength i think they have rightfully determined that the landscape is against them obama had a very very good convention and is likely to take a substantial lead the decision to make a straight play for women disaffected because hillary clinton was not on the ticket led them to pick gov palin
9126155 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9126156 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9126157 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9126158 i think its a miscalculation to believe women voters supported hillary clinton just because shes a woman
9126159 experience her depth the fact that she looked and acted so ready to be president and the fact that people knew her so well after her years as first lady and her experience in elected office that very much contributed to her appeal
9126160 they saw her as a qualified woman ready to be president and i think it was that more than anything having to do just with her gender i dont think that automatically transfers to mccains pick
9126161 she made people mad at her that you dont want mad at you
9126162 im not very impressed with sen obama quite frankly when it comes to doing the hard things im very impressed with gov palin as somebody who can come and turn washington upside down i think thats the narrative that will resonate
9126163 when i was in high school he was one of the first musicians i got into i like to get into music history so ive done a lot of reading about parker every year i gain a better appreciation of him im beginning to love his music even more
9126164 hes such an integral part of the history of jazz and saxophone hes contributed so much to the music you study birds music and everything is there he wrote some of the best hes one of the most amazing improvisers of all time someone with that kind of mastery of the music will never be forgotten thats why bird lives on today
9126165 we spent a lot of time together there was no other like him
9126166 the only song i know on piano he taught me
9126167 we learned to smoke together and drink together it got to be where he was at my home all the time we just had fun he was a jovial person at all times
9126168 even if just a little bit of that has rubbed off on me thats a high honor its something im very proud of
9126169 should ordinarily be given by the priest celebrant himself he may entrust it to a concelebrating priest or occasionally according to circumstances to a deacon but never to a layperson in particular cases and for a just cause the homily may even be given by a bishop or a priest who is present at the celebration but cannot concelebrate
9126170 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9126171 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
9126172 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
9126173 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
9126174 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9126175 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
9126176 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
9126177 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
9126178 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9126179 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9126180 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
9126181 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
9126182 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
9126183 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
9126184 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
9126185 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
9126186 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
9126187 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
9126188 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9126189 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
9126190 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
9126191 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
9126192 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9126193 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9126194 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
9126195 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
9126196 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9126197 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience
9126198 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
9126199 theres nothing really new to report on senator mccains decision i think well all hear from him shortly and hopefully well be able to move forward together
9126200 mitt by far and away is the most logical pick
9126201 look at the polling nationwide the only guy that helps at all is romney
9126202 mccain has said time and again that he doesnt understand the economy
9126203 pokes fun at the catholic population and offends religion and the pope
9126204 with humor and a tragicomic sense which belongs to art since the times of greek tragedy kippenberger faces his condition of suffering which he expresses in many works also for example in a video in which he crucifies himself
9126205 has blinded it to the fact that the market does not necessarily foster good character and may if allowed to eat its way through communities and civil society actively destroy it
9126206 harry has made no secret of the fact he wants to be there when the regiment returns to the front line next year
9126207 he said the experience of leading his men into battle is one he hopes he can repeat
9126208 and with one mission under his belt he has the skills and experience which will make him an extremely valuable member of the battle group
9126209 once again it is the powers that be who will decide if harry can have his wish
9126210 again the issue is whether his mere presence in the theatre of war will make his men an added target for the taliban
9126211 for now he will carry on doing his job just like the rest of his men no matter how long it takes for him to get a decision it is important he continues training so he is battle ready if required
9126212 it is clear he sees himself as a soldier and as such he is desperate to do the job for which he is trained
9126213 although harry is a troop commander with four scimitars to command he went to afghanistan as a forward air controller it is up to him basically to decide which role he wishes to train for
9126214 he was excellent as an fac and did his job in afghanistan superbly
9126215 if he wishes to continue as an fac then he will have to train continuously in that role if he does not keep up his skills in that role then he will not get his ticket to work in that role
9126216 alternatively he can revert to the role he was originally trained for as a scimitar troop commander
9126217 the regiment are deploying this time next year and harry has made it clear he does not want to be left behind
9126218 she first ran for office back in 1992 i dont know what senator obama was doing then but the first time she ran was 1992 thats 16 years i think thats a pretty pretty event filled and record filled resume
9126219 i havent had too many years other than that to fill up yet
9126220 absolutely yup yup especially with a good team around us
9126221 shes heard that her whole life the challenges of being a female mother in the work force
9126222 i remember the first time she ran for mayor on of her fellow council members told her you cant run for mayor because youve got three negatives track bristol and willow those are the three kids we had at the time so when you tell her that kind of stuff she just gets fired up were an alaska family that adapts
9126223 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9126224 i havent met her before she seems like a compelling person with a terrific personal story
9126225 im sure that she will help make the case for republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same and so ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket
9126226 he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies
9126227 but the fact that she will soon be nominated is one more indicator of this country moving forward one more hit against that glass ceiling i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9126228 im pleased with my choice for vice president joe biden i think hes the man who can help me guide this country in a better direction and help working families
9126229 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9126230 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9126231 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9126232 i had promised todd a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver she quipped to laughs and applause
9126233 on september 11th of last year our son enlisted in the united states army
9126234 he now serves in an infantry brigade and september 11th he will deploy to iraq in the service of his country
9126235 i promised todd a little surprise for our anniversary present
9126236 but whopping huge mounds of trash remain unavoidable and the presence of idling suvs show that the concept remains more of a slogan than reality
9126237 maybe these garbage sorting jobs are the type of jobs mr obama plans to hook us up with
9126238 and if allah hates someone he calls jibreel and says i hate so and so and you hate him jibreel hates him and calls the angels in heaven and says allah hates so and so so you all hate him they all hate him and his hatred is made upon earth and he becomes hated
9126239 allah has commanded that everything one does they should do it with excellence ihsan when you sacrifice sacrifice well sharpen your knife and make it easy for the animal to be
9126240 next i appealed to them publicly then i broadcast it to them and confided with them privately proclaiming seek forgiveness from your lord he is so forgiving he causes the sky to send torrents down upon you and he supplies you with wealth and children and grants you gardens and even grants you rivers
9126241 the example of the person abiding by allahs orders and limits or the one who abides by the limits and regulations prescribed by allah in comparison to the one who do wrong and violate allahs limits and orders is like the example of people drawing lots for seats in a boat
9126242 you have been troubled much by my coming up to you and i have to get water now if they prevent him from doing that they will save him and themselves but if they leave him to do what he wants they will destroy him and themselves
9126243 i hate how sometimes i have to wait for a long time for my ride to come when i get off the skytrain
9126244 folks look given this pick and all i have learned about what would happen with a democratic victory we have no choice but to enthusiastically work for the mccain palin ticket
9126245 i regret the harm this has caused my family my friends and this community
9126246 not at all convinced that sending defendants such as ward to prison is the best way to address the societal problem of child porn proliferating on the internet
9126247 amoral universally unacceptable and aberrant the governments court documents alleged that ward possessed images of sex acts on children as young as three years old and revealed his online exchanges with the dominatrix in which he discussed his sexual attraction to children
9126248 these images depicted these minors suffering the most horrific torment steve grocki a justice department lawyer who led the ward prosecution said to walker
9126249 what is profoundly sad is that bernie ward is a good man
9126250 shall i lead you to a family who will look after him for you they will take good care of him
9126251 la decisi n de que los astronautas estadounidenses ser n transportados a la estaci n espacial internacional iss a bordo de nuestras
9126252 shes exactly who i need shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9126253 senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate i will be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9126254 as governor ive stood up to the old politics as usual
9126255 this is a moment when principle and political independence matter
9126256 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9126257 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9126258 it is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9126259 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9126260 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time

9126268 people are getting smarter people are beginning to see that the damage ensuing from producing agrofuels by far outweighs any possible benefits
9126269 rushing to turn food crops into fuel for cars without first examining the impact on global hunger is a recipe for disaster
9126270 agrofuel production is unacceptable if it brings greater hunger and water scarcity to the poor in developing countries
9126271 its been so long since weve had a front office we can fully trust its nice isnt it
9126272 rich cimini of the new york daily news reports new york jets lb vernon gholston was a disappointment for the team throughout the preseason gholston made little impact in the teams preseason game thursday aug 28 recording just three tackles with no sacks or pressures
9126273 mr bungle i completely understand your point of keeping quality players over average ones but i also think you need depth because if an ol or a wide receiver goes down what are you going to do put john beck at wr
9126274 beck has that eerie aura like hes gonna light it up with another team and pull a welker
9126275 ha ha mr bungle you were wrong now we can get a second punter
9126276 i signed a three year contact with ipswich after finishing my gcses and played five competitive matches with the team as centre half i also had periods on loan to stockport county and wycombe wanderers but by then an ongoing tendonitis injury to my knee was affecting my fitness
9126277 in the summer of 2007 at the age of 20 i made the decision to retire from professional football and set my sights on gaining a place at university and pursuing a career with different challenges
9126278 i was keen to continue my interest in sport and wanted to keep my options open so also chose as english language literature law and sociology
9126279 after four years away from education it took time to get used to studying again but i am really enjoying the subjects and the tutors and lecturers are great very supportive
9126280 next year ill complete my a levels and hope to build on my achievements so far after college i plan to study for a degree in history or sociology and may eventually make a career in teaching

9126285 their treatment of women throughout the decades leading up to even now this sort of attitude that women are so stupid that theyre going to just vote for somebody because theyre a woman even though this woman is against the very things that women are for and the things that women need i mean they really think women are i guess just dumb or something i dont think women across the country right now are feeling honored by this event today

9126289 yes we i didnt through you under the bus for breaking it so we fixed it
9126290 good luck with that mr supervisor i fixed it and i certainly didnt break it it was already broken and the owner and i have already discussed this issue have a nice night
9126291 i want to live with my dad he loves me i hate it here i hate you all
9126292 ive been working hard to get back to where i need to be physically
9126293 when i come to san diego my body feels better you can get away with a few more mistakes here than you can in other ballparks
9126294 i think as we move into september youll see some more players getting an opportunity to play
9126295 theres a bunch of guys now getting an opportunity to show what they can do
9126296 just establish the run hit you in the mouth three yards and a cloud of dust
9126297 we feel pretty confident at the depth that we have at the running back position
9126298 were fortunate here at carver weve got a lot of good skill kids we can go to a second or third back and not drop off that much at all
9126299 we have a lot of confidence in our passing game
9126300 we feel like michael lawrence is a really good quarterback
9126301 collin floyd is a big receiver which causes match up problems for defensive backs he did a good job running his routes
9126302 after the score was 28 6 we decided we could play with them
9126303 every hawk fan knows if they want a room they better be looking to book one year in advance
9126304 we called them 60 days in advance and told them to call the visitors bureau
9126305 the same man she fell in love with 19 years ago
9126306 this storm has the potential for being a very dangerous storm
9126307 i do not want to speculate but i am fearful that we could be looking at a number in the region of 10 in terms of the number of people who have died
9126308 for the first game this year and what we are trying to establish in commitment responsibility and accountability the kids did a great job
9126309 we made some mistakes but we gave up too many plays on defense we couldnt stop the run and we just made mental mistakes but those are things we can eliminate
9126310 will this be the year the wildcats make the playoffs
9126311 we felt that the kids were mentally prepared to go tonight but in the end they are kids and you just dont know sometimes
9126312 we just didnt know how the kids would respond in an adverse situation
9126313 when those kids were faced with adversity tonight they responded
9126314 i couldnt be more proud of how they handled the adversity and came right back and responded like they did
9126315 once we started marching the ball we really felt like we could play with fremd
9126316 the ball just kind of popped out of nowhere right into my arms
9126317 there was a huge hole right when i caught it and i just took off running
9126318 i couldnt have done any of this without the guys blocking in front of me
9126319 they made it all possible they made a big hole and i ran through it
9126320 we started to move the ball better in the second half
9126321 i know i was nervous at the start and it was hard to get into a good rhythm early
9126322 when it came right down to it with the game on the line we didnt make plays defensively
9126323 did we hang in there yes we did but we didnt get any turnovers and didnt make anything happen
9126324 we dont want to try to emulate beijing what we want is new ways of thinking about the opening ceremony
9126325 we want the whole of london to be involved with different parts of london taking part in the ceremony the london games must be deeply democratic with the citys citizens feeling theyre intimately involved
9126326 i think what you will see is a very vivid sense of celebration right across the city at both the opening and closing ceremonies
9126327 in terms of great organisation fantastic facilities and a welcoming attitude and pride among the people beijing was superb but there are things we can and will do better
9126328 i saw lots and lots of chinese people standing outside stadiums on the wrong part of a perimeter fence as observers rather than participants we must reverse that trend and make sure our olympics are more accessible
9126329 i also want to minimise the number of empty seats in stadiums which frustrate the public and keep them at a distance for no reason

9126345 it was very weird it was the most beautiful green and white light moving quite fast then stopping it had to be mechanical like a spaceship because it slowed down and stopped it wasnt making any noise it disappeared in a flash i went home and told my girlfriend she didnt believe me but the pictures speak for themselves
9126346 the pictures are interesting it is a mystery someone should look into these pictures further given the sheer number of sightings weve seen this summer and the unprecedented number of photos and videos its time for a full public inquiry

9126373 we didnt know what they were going to do on offense and defense it was different from their approach last year it was the first time since ive been here that we produced in all three phases
9126374 it was a slant where you take two steps and run to the pylon
9126375 it was just a matter of faking out the defense it just came open
9126376 getting the ball down deep in armys territory from there its simple
9126377 the defense put us in a good position bruce made a good play and maneri ran a good route

9126380 weve got high school kids running round in calvin klein and guess who cannot pass a sixth grade reading test but if you ask them they can tell you the name of every crotch on mtv and it feels like i am living in the wasteland of the free
9126381 this is great news for stroke survivors because results clearly demonstrate that long term stroke damage is not immutable and that with exercise its never too late for the brain and body to recover
9126382 with this the threat of hiccups in chiranjeevi getting the name prajarajyam for his party has been ironed out
9126383 however the application was in plain paper and not supported by relevant documents we sent him a letter asking him to file the application in the proper format and with supporting documents he has not responded to that yet
9126384 on the outside the congress and the tdp may say they are not perturbed by chiranjeevis entry into politics but by trying to woo krishnaiah they have admitted to the contrary
9126385 propriety rights to the sasb in respect of the 800 kanals of land
9126386 if dinp is replaced by alternative products thats a potential risk to children
9126387 banning a product before a conclusive scientific determination is reached is short sighted and may result in the introduction of unregulated substitute chemicals that harm childrens health
9126388 we have women who could potentially break a certain glass ceiling too
9126389 both teams are physical teams that like to run the ball but our offensive line controlled the game
9126390 this makes all the running by ourselves on the track in the summer and all the weightlifting in the offseason worthwhile
9126391 our offensive line was just doing a great job of getting those holes open
9126392 you could drive a truck right through themm and it was pretty easy
9126393 both teams are physical teams that like to run the ball but our offensive line controlled the game
9126394 our offensive line was just doing a great job of getting those holes open

9126396 this makes all the running by ourselves on the track in the summer and all the weightlifting in the offseason worthwhile
9126397 i like to think of myself as a diamond in the rough someone whos going to sneak up on people
9126398 it makes me feel like i have something to remember
9126399 i thought all the jews in the whole world were dead
9126400 if i look at a garment on the person i can tell right away what i need to do

9126407 no decision has been taken on when work will be resumed our employees are afraid and companys first priority is to ensure safety of the staff

9126411 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
9126412 the plank in support of abortion rights is even stronger than usual gone is the phrase from the past that abortions should be safe legal
9126413 the allegations surfaced during the investigation but we had to do our due diligence
9126414 caseys attorney jose baez diligently tried to contact authorities to surrender his client

9126418 who cares what the pc board looks like the only thing thats important is how well that it works nobody is going to see the pc board
9126419 he was definitely outplaying me for the first two sets i felt like a little kid out here playing against him
9126420 and then the clock struck 12 and i started playing well as a 26 year old
9126421 i was disappointed in the second set i think i should have finished it
9126422 i wouldnt have won the match already but it would have been a big step
9126423 tonight was probably one of those ones i won on effort
9126424 the creation of the universe and the expulsion from paradise

9126429 mummy im feeling really really cross can we talk about this
9126430 me for myself my personal opinion i never once doubted myself
9126431 whether it was sooner than later i didnt know but i knew eventually id get here
9126432 it finally did happen now i just want to make the best of my opportunity
9126433 and you dont expect him to be as agile as he is
9126434 i like his versatility and his swing path is really very short and he never panics
9126435 it actually helped me to spend more time in the minors
9126436 there were a lot of things early in my career that i really didnt understand as i got older and played more i understood better how you have to move runners and give yourself up you have to pick and choose your time to try to drive the ball
9126437 it really can take you down i want to be the type of person who uses things like that for motivation basically just try to prove people wrong
9126438 its worked out for me now im in a situation where i can actually help this club
9126439 me for myself my personal opinion i never once doubted myself
9126440 whether it was sooner than later i didnt know but i knew eventually id get here

9126449 korrektiv s pithy and bold approach separates it from the blogospheric herd and the combination of poetry theology and opinion makes it unique you might not always agree with korrektiv but you cant ignore it
9126450 im a lance corporal in the marine corps stationed in mosel iraq between missions i dont have a lot of time to get caught up on the news someone from my group turned me on to korrektiv and i have to tell you that its become my one stop shop for news and opinion from back home thanks korrektiv

9126453 the toughest period of trading it has experienced in its time as a public company
9126454 the group considers that the current difficult trading environment will continue for the foreseeable future with continued poor mortgage liquidity limiting housing market activity
9126455 fly into gatwick and see why london needs another airport
9126456 there are 74 conservation areas in the country and north kent marshes has four of them dotted around where they were proposing to put the airport last time
9126457 its a very special area and home to a great number of birds and other wildlife
9126458 i really just wish that people like boris johnson would come down here and see whats there before they spout out ridiculous ideas like putting an airport in cliffe
9126459 an airport on the thames estuary is never going to be viable or popular
9126460 cllr simon day seems to be able to ignore planning regulations what has been built is totally out of keeping with the existing bungalows in the road a lot of people are upset about this
9126461 starting work before a decision was made shows little regard for the planning process
9126462 it seems like one rule for councillors and another for others when the committee told him cllr day that he should have installed clouded glass he ignored it and put in clear glass he was not supposed to do it and is breaking the regulations
9126463 the local government ombudsman has said that the council has done the right thing
9126464 the sill of the windows are two metres off the ground you would have to stand on a chair or a ladder to look out of them
9126465 the home owner is now at liberty to have clear glass in those top windows as long as the sills are two metres off the floor which they are
9126466 officers said at the meeting that they didnt envisage high level windows when they put the condition on about frosted glass if you really want to look out of them you can but you have to try really hard and that is where this whole thing falls down
9126467 the fact that the applicant is a member of the planning committee should be neither here nor there we have to judge it on the same terms that we would anyone else
9126468 a lot of effort has been put into this project by a lot of people
9126469 it is a great shame that we are unable to proceed but we retain ownership of the site and we will be working with our partners to develop new proposals to secure its long term regeneration
9126470 it is obviously disappointing news that the interface land developer is having financial difficulties but this is not unique in the current market
9126471 seeda and its joint landowner chatham historic dockyard trust are assessing the situation at present but remain totally committed to the principles of a joint development on this strategically important site
9126472 this might take longer to achieve in the current climate but the benefits to the area and medways regeneration ambitions remain a key objective for this sites future development
9126473 this site is undoubtedly one of the most exciting regeneration projects in the south east today
9126474 it really is a fantastic opportunity to create a complete 21st century living and working environment alongside the historic dockyard
9126475 significant expansion of housing and the port together with a proposed incinerator all have one thing in common
9126476 they are promising a dramatic increase in the traffic levels in the dover district
9126477 kent green party has already objected to a large increase in dovers housing allocation on the grounds of using greenfield sites and adding to traffic
9126478 similarly increases in heavy goods vehicles going through dover at a rate of about seven or eight per cent more each year cannot and should not be accommodated
9126479 dover already has an extensive air quality management area due to a combination of traffic and shipping emissions
9126480 we note that kent county council has reserved preferred incinerator sites at the former tilmanstone colliery site near eythorne the old richborough power station site north of sandwich and the white cliffs business park at whitfield
9126481 having admitted that the allington incinerator near maidstone is an economic and technical
9126482 building an incinerator conflicts with recycling targets and will generate thousands of extra hgv movements a year
9126483 we suggest the district council in cooperation with kcc the south east england development agency the environment agency and other bodies commissions a strategic environmental assessment
9126484 i feel strongly about this project and have had a lot of residents approach me with reservations over the designs
9126485 we should have been given a much broader set of ideas the whole thing seems badly conceived and should have been organised by the authorities
9126486 the first thing we knew about this is when they announced there was a shortlist of five artists in the frame to do a design for a huge sculpture
9126487 mark wallingers plan seems to have the most kentish themes but even those are ill thought out and not well researched
9126488 you could go and buy a plastic farm set for kids and arrive at the same result thats not sculpture
9126489 i feel very sorry for the lord lieutenant of kent alan willett as head judge he loves kent but could be in charge of something that people dont want
9126490 i feel strongly that we should have a proper invicta horse
9126491 if the people in this county do not get the horse they want it will be received very badly
9126492 its as if a bunch of sponsors have decided this is what we are going to do and it doesnt really matter what residents want
9126493 trying to compete with the angel of the north by making it taller or whatever is pathetic
9126494 antony gormley lived and worked in the north east he is a true part of where the exhibit is none of the five shortlisted artists for kents sculpture have anything to do with the county
9126495 but i cant see mark wallinger changing his design because he would lose credibility as an artist
9126496 during the consultation process it quickly became clear that the future of eurokent is not based upon it being earmarked solely for industrial businesses
9126497 this committee should not be taking a decision this evening given the convoluted and complex implications concerning this application i urge members to follow their consciences and defer this application to full council and to tdc scrutiny at the very least
9126498 and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves

9126504 the choice of sarah palin into anything but a brilliant choice

9126513 well not sure if its relevant but from what i hear from people at my university research is going on delving deeper into a cpu that uses light instead of electricity as light travels much faster than electrons
9126514 that would be very cool although the only problem with that is that barely any light gets to the cpu because of how inclosed the computer is

9126574 with this the threat of hiccups in chiranjeevi getting the name prajarajyam for his party has been ironed out
9126575 however the application was in plain paper and not supported by relevant documents we sent him a letter asking him to file the application in the proper format and with supporting documents he has not responded to that yet
9126576 on the outside the congress and the tdp may say they are not perturbed by chiranjeevis entry into politics but by trying to woo krishnaiah they have admitted to the contrary

9126585 it is quite rare and alcohol increases her chances of an attack
9126586 shes been fairly good for a while but the amount of alcohol she consumed yesterday made it impossible for her to control herself
9126587 so in conclusion yossy wasnt aware of what she was doing and i am very very sorry that this happened to you
9126588 just ride the elevator all the way to the top and your room is up there
9126589 get your ass out of here before you touch her

9126597 shes been fairly good for a while but the amount of alcohol she consumed yesterday made it impossible for her to control herself

9126605 its my belief given the improvement in the security situation in iraq that there will be a continued withdrawal of u s forces as promised by gen petraeus at his last congressional hearing later this fall

9126620 im not going to lie i stole some gum i stole a lot of gum actually i was a rookie at valeting cars
9126621 i was studying broadcast journalism but i just could not find my niche so i took a semester off and to earn some money i was valeting cars in the meantime i certainly earned that gum
9126622 they jonas brothers tried to play it cool but it definitely seemed as if theres something more than friendship going on
9126623 well shes an amazing girl and anybody would be lucky to be dating her
9126624 well like i said anybody would be lucky to be dating her i think she is a part of our music video and that is why all the rumors started but yeah shes a cool girl
9126625 in the four films starring kate we are given dream sequences that invite us to imagine how we might fulfil her desires
9126626 the dreams are beautifully crafted fantasies each with an eerie atmosphere that brings us into a serene la la land where we feel free to imagine pleasing kate
9126627 the camera closes in on her bulging behind as it rides up and down and shakes from side to side
9126628 tease out mens deepest fantasies through the power of suggestion
9126629 she started showing me all of her personal items from under her bed that her ex boyfriend gave her so she pulled out his dirty socks and a bunch of photographs
9126630 the necklace shes wearing in the video is the necklace he gave her shes wearing his diabetes or medical necklace
9126631 there are certain stories that dont end the way that they end in the book its not really family stuff its more like well theres a bit in the book about demi moore and i dancing on the bar we went out and demi was dancing up on me and humping me from behind
9126632 the one part thats not in the book is that she was lactating at the time and she was squirting breast milk at my lesbian friends
9126633 my friend michelle called me the next morning and asked me how do i get breast milk out of my black dress and i said how the fuck would i know call demi it was hysterical
9126634 there are no pictures of it but it actually happened the lawyers didnt think it was wise for me to print that so theres your juicy titbit
9126635 i really like you so much and have a lot of respect for you but i would like to marry you
9126636 and i have a question which side of the bed do you prefer to sleep on
9126637 do you have a theme song s for your life
9126638 you dont know what its like to love somebody the way i love you
9126639 i dont know what you believe but i believe that the universe gives you what you need i needed you to quilt for me so i can relax and enjoy sewing thank you
9126640 it was a surprise to see it in the street like that
9126641 we usually hear them whooshing overhead as they pass over our neighborhood
9126642 this one sounded like it was in our backyard which it almost was
9126643 one truck had to come to a complete stop and back up to get around it
9126644 i dont know why they landed here in the middle of a busy neighborhood
9126645 whatever the reason it landed here it was a nice safe landing in the middle of the street instead of somebodys rooftop or trees
9126646 there was nothing like this offered in keene before they started building
9126647 there was assisted living but nothing for those independent livers it was something that was really desperately needed
9126648 what piqued my interest right away was the parent company had a philosophy of wanting a real crossover between the hotel and resort industry and senior living
9126649 and of course the location if i took the job i would get to be where my mother and brothers are it was win win
9126650 and i thank you senator mccain and mrs mccain for the confidence that you have placed in me senator i am honored to be chosen as your running mate i will be honored to serve next to the next president of the united states
9126651 i know that when senator mccain gave me this opportunity he had a short list of highly qualified men and women and to have made that list at all it was a privilege
9126652 first there are a few people whom i would like you to meet i want to start with my husband todd and todd and i are actually celebrating our 20th anniversary today and i promised him a little surprise for the anniversary present and hopefully he knows that i did deliver
9126653 and then we have as after my husband who is a lifelong commercial fisherman lifetime alaskan hes a production operator
9126654 along the way todd and i have shared many blessings and four out of five of them are here with us today
9126655 next to todd is our daughter bristol another daughter willow our youngest daughter piper and over in their arms is our son trig a beautiful baby boy he was born just in april his name is trig paxson van palin
9126656 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case today
9126657 i was then appointed ethics commissioner and chairman of the alaska oil and gas conservation commission and when i found corruption there i fought it hard and i held the offenders to account
9126658 when oil and gas prices went up so dramatically and the state revenues followed with that increase i sent a large share of that revenue directly back to the people of alaska and we are now were now embarking on a 40 billion natural gas pipeline to help lead america to energy independence
9126659 i signed major ethics reforms and i appointed both democrats and independents to serve in my administration
9126660 well its always though safer in politics to avoid risk to just kind of go along with the status quo
9126661 now no one expects us to agree on everything whether in juneau or in washington but we are expected to govern with integrity and good will and clear convictions and a servants heart
9126662 now no leader in america has shown these qualities so clearly or presents so clear a threat to business as usual in washington as senator john s
9126663 and this is a moment that requires resolve and toughness and strength of heart in the american president
9126664 and im going to make sure nobody does forget that in his campaign there is only one candidate who has truly fought for america and that man is john mccain
9126665 this is a moment this is a moment when great causes can be won and great threats overcome depending on the judgment of our next president in a dangerous world it is john mccain who will lead americas friends and allies in preventing iran from acquiring nuclear weapons
9126666 it was john mccain who cautioned long ago about the harm that russian aggression could do to georgia and to other small democratic neighbors and to the world oil markets
9126667 it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know what as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9126668 profiles in courage they can be hard to come by these days you know so often we just find them in books but next week when we nominate john mccain for president were putting one on the ballot
9126669 to serve as vice president beside such a man would be the privilege of a lifetime and its fitting that this trust has been given to me 88 years almost to the day after the women of america first gained the right to vote
9126670 i think as well today of two other women who came before me in national elections i cant begin this great effort without honoring the achievements of geraldine ferraro in 1984 and of course senator hillary clinton who showed such determination and grace in her presidential campaign
9126671 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9126672 my fellow americans come join our cause join our cause and help our country to elect a great man the next president of the united states and i thank you and i god bless you i say and god bless america thank you

9126691 people take different roads seeking fulfillment and happiness just because they are not on your road does not mean they have gotten lost
9126692 action may not always bring happiness but there is no happiness without action
9126693 the foolish person seeks happiness in the distance the wise person grows it under his feet

9126695 very often people confuse simple with simplistic the nuance is lost on most
9126696 the sculptor produces the beautiful statue by chipping away such parts of the marble block as are not needed it is a process of elimination

9126698 life is really simple but we insist on making it complicated
9126699 the ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak
9126700 simplicity is indeed often the sign of truth and a criterion of beauty

9126705 true friendship comes when silence between two people is comfortable

9126855 take some time learn to breath and remember what it means to feel alive to believe theres something more than what you see i know theres a price for this but some things in life you must resist
9126856 like i said to look into the eyes of death was intoxicating taking it into our lungs laughing at ourselves where others would probably cry and more importantly would probably just die to stand face to face with your demons and not back down takes a constitution that most people just dont have a life thats soiled with sex drugs and rock n roll

9126925 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
9126926 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin

9126963 im looking forward to collaborating with jamie and working with all of the great people at grand central publishing again the u s olympic gold medal team has served as a perfect example of what successful team building is all about
9126964 we absolutely cherish our long term publishing relationship with one of americas truly legendary coaches and were thrilled to be able to work with mike and jamie on this project all basketball fans know that america still has the highest total of top stars but it took the coaching magic of coach k to find the right players get them to work as a team and to bring home the gold we anticipate this work to be a meaningful case study in fundamental management techniques and as with his previous books transcend the world of sports

9126970 part of it is personal fit he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9126971 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9126972 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9126973 well sure i would be too if they were going to put me under i mean when youre a nurse when you know the things we know

9126986 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
9126987 americans made it clear that it is morally and economically unacceptable that our high schoolers continue to score lower on math and science tests than most other students in the world and continue to drop out at higher rates than their peers in other industrial nations

9126992 like most countries america has always had its share of itinerant travelers vagabonds and hoboes
9126993 i was raised never to pass a beggar by but there are too many of them and im sick of it
9126994 the escalation and other cities faced it have been surprising
9126995 if the neighborhood cannot keep a bothersome panhandler from annoying passersby it is even less likely to call the police to identify a potential mugger or to interfere if a mugging actually takes place
9126996 new york fed up with the disorder began to crack down on panhandling in the early nineties the effort started in the subways spearheaded by the bratton led metropolitan transit authority police who combined policing with outreach efforts for homeless beggars willing to come in off the streets the cleanup continued when bratton became giulianis first police commissioner in 1994 and took on the squeegee men insistent panhandlers who intimidated manhattan drivers by washing their car windows and then demanding payment after a study by criminologist george kelling found that three quarters of the squeegee men werent homeless and that half had felony records cops began arresting them for blocking traffic that put an end to the shakedowns in a matter of weeks
9126997 from an engineering standpoint its a piece of cake the dam built between 1938 and 1945 was originally planned to be 200 feet taller at 800 feet it would have been the highest and biggest in the world
9126998 sheri harral public affairs officer at the dam said world war ii and materials shortages associated with the war effort led to a decision to stop construction at 602 feet
9126999 the thinking was to come back and add on to it if ever there was a need to
9127000 if shasta dam had been built up to its engineering limit in 1945 it is arguable that northern and central california would not be facing a critical water shortage now
9127001 according to a 1999 bureau of reclamation study a dam 200 feet taller would be able to triple storage to 13 89 million acre feet of water

9127006 there is no such thing as heterodoxy that is a lie of the adversary

9127008 if you had faith the size of a mustard seed you could say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it would obey you
9127009 because of your unbelief as to why the disciples couldnt cast the demons in the epileptic child out for assuredly i say to you if you have faith as a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you
9127010 highly palatable food can mimic opioid drugs by releasing opioids or activating sensitized receptors so imagine what it can do in a human with a history of dieting if only rat chow is available even rats with a history of dieting when stressed dont binge but when they get a little bite of cookie first they do
9127011 of all the bizarre diets that have been proposed in the last 50 years this is the most dangerous to the public if followed for any length of time
9127012 whats wrong with taking an overdose of sleeping pills you are placing your body in jeopardy

9127015 sheri harral public affairs officer at the dam said world war ii and materials shortages associated with the war effort led to a decision to stop construction at 602 feet
9127016 the thinking was to come back and add on to it if ever there was a need to
9127017 if shasta dam had been built up to its engineering limit in 1945 it is arguable that northern and central california would not be facing a critical water shortage now
9127018 according to a 1999 bureau of reclamation study a dam 200 feet taller would be able to triple storage to 13 89 million acre feet of water

9127023 kampung komodo indonesia at least once a week an unwelcome intruder crawls under a clapboard wall and forked tongue darting lumbers its way into syarif maulanas classroom
9127024 then everyone screams there is no more school and we all run away very fast
9127025 the intruder a komodo dragon is the worlds largest lizard an ancient fierce carnivore found only on a handful of remote islands in eastern indonesia
9127026 that killing and a spate of other close encounters has fanned a panic in the dragons main habitat the komodo national park
9127027 these locals have long viewed the dragons as a reincarnation of fellow kinsfolk to be treated with reverence but now villagers say the once friendly dragons have turned into vicious man eaters and they blame policies drafted by american funded environmentalists for this frightening turn of events
9127028 for years climate change was a story told largely via melting snow and ice
9127029 animals that are relatively static have a much more limited ability to move if climate changes faster than they can find new habitat theyre out of business
9127030 sometimes in order to be good to the earth you have to become one with the earth
9127031 that explained all the muddy feet and hands at the new
9127032 the vertical single family units on the 1 62 acre plot are known for using sustainable products such as wood trim harvested from trees on the site and kitchen countertops made from recycled paper the list goes on
9127033 so when it came time to build two benches in the public area of the property it was a safe bet they wouldnt be normal benches
9127034 the stylish curved benches came together saturday with the most basic materials taken from the job site dirt sand and stone its similar to the cob style earthen structures built in england and elsewhere that have stood against the elements for hundreds of years
9127035 noting there are cob homes in england still standing after five centuries baker said
9127036 in addition to building benches the outing saturday served as a workshop for earthen structures and involving the community about 25 eager people signed up for saturdays dirty work
9127037 its labor intensive but thats not always a bad thing
9127038 this sword will never be sheathed again until the kingdoms of this world become the kingdom of our god and his christ
9127039 i dont know how to repent from something thats true or probably true i dont know how to do that i shouldnt have to
9127040 brought and laid the plates before our eyes that we beheld and saw
9127041 never claimed to have seen them with his natural eyes only with spiritual vision
9127042 since no such cave exists at the new york site
9127043 he was disfellowhipped for telling the truth as he saw it
9127044 one of the most ironic statements that i have ever read coming from farms
9127045 there is no supporting evidence for this statement if god doesnt want the cave to be discovered until the appointed time it wont
9127046 from past experiences of how written apostate statements books articles etc are handled he would have been given the chance to retract his statements first if he chose not to then that would be more of the reason he was disfellowshipped not because of the actual thing he wrote
9127047 yes packer is a member of farms but his words were his opinion and not that of the entire farms foundation
9127048 your words seem to lead others away from and not to truth
9127049 asking him to retract something that he sincerely believes to be true is immoral
9127050 i think ive heard this argument before but in reference to the apostles and prophets
9127051 it was a farms publication so it came from farms
9127052 in my post i included the link to packers article
9127053 i was anonymous until recently this helped me learn more about setting up my own blog thank you perhaps some day we will meet again
9127054 the question really is do you accept the church of jesus christ of latter day saints as the lords church on earth
9127055 would you like to sit on the porch or would you rather live
9127056 the subject matter and testimony at this informational hearing shall be limited to reclamation of the nonmetallic mine site
9127057 based upon such evidence as may be presented at such public hearing tending to show the desirability or undesirability of specific proposed locations for the proposed use from the standpoint of the public interest because of such factors as without limitation because of enumeration smoke dust noxious and toxic gases and odors noise vibrations from operation of heavy equipment heavy vehicular traffic and increased traffic
9127058 before this all anyone talked about was sea surface temperature we had to convince them it was about the water temperatures down deep we have a lot more to do but at least its part of the vocabulary now
9127059 its really very important work and people are starting to understand that more and more
9127060 when it comes to intensity forecasting and thats the big goal right now ocean heat is everything
9127061 to my knowledge and i was not here at the time none of what i see in here is accurate or true
9127062 theyre just trying to create as much damage as possible
9127063 the managing owner of the dealership is the appropriate person to address the issue
9127064 i just wanted to go and get my head together
9127065 and if you find that theres significant accounting discrepancies you dont typically go through a warning process
9127066 i think hell be 78 years old he wont be doing the speaking circuit much longer the chance to get to see him in real life will be a once in a lifetime thing
9127067 no ordinary time franklin and eleanor roosevelt the home front in world war ii
9127068 memo to the president elect how we can restore americas reputation and leadership
9127069 i think hell surprise a lot of people whove not heard him before
9127070 the one that people talked about years later he makes something thats very difficult and complicated seem very easy to understand
9127071 this would be a project that would turn the tide of cars
9127072 it would provide one of the key elements to sustainable communities in north manatee county instead of a sea of cul de sacs and gated communities this development will be all encompassing we are providing a foothold for parrish to succeed
9127073 ive seen those developments in other areas and they work really well
9127074 he is a true visionary and a great thinker he is driven by the prospect of having a dynamic thriving community
9127075 if people think about it it cant hurt property values
9127076 development is inevitable it would be nice things to have
9127077 if they can bring industry here more power to them
9127078 i dont think people realize that we are heading into some tough economic times
9127079 the fed would not have made this public unless they determined it was a serious enough situation for them to do it
9127080 its suggesting that the current board is not strong and needs to be strengthened
9127081 its amazing how mechanical gorrie was being a medical doctor they marvel at the machine and theyre amazed he invented it in a small town like apalachicola
9127082 but you know with the state cutting back and all
9127083 its amazing when i ask kids in this town and they dont know who he is
9127084 after five weeks of photographing and interviewing icemen in mississippi my time and money had come to an end
9127085 however i already had a new goal in mind to visit the holy grail of block icedom
9127086 could help shatter the glass ceiling once and for all
9127087 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9127088 she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for
9127089 as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard
9127090 kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9127091 it was rightly noted in denver this week that hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9127092 but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9127093 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9127094 john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9127095 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee
9127096 is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency
9127097 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9127098 marriage should only be between a man and a woman
9127099 that was one of the most exciting days of my life
9127100 he runs hard and has great balance and has breakaway speed
9127101 it could have been real easy to say oh no were at venice big school blah blah i dont think our kids believed the hype of all that big school vs little school stuff they fought for four quarters
9127102 we came out hyped in the second half and ready to play
9127103 i see the open field and i just move faster to get to the end zone
9127104 between biden obama and mccain palin is the only one who can spell energy the rest of these guys are completely clueless
9127105 she has shown an independent streak and has been anything but a patsy in dealing with the oil industry in alaska
9127106 no one is closer to the oil industry than governor palin
9127107 simply continue the failed policies of the bush cheney administration and their big oil friends policies that could make us even more dependent on foreign oil
9127108 they dont have big color pictures of sarah palin in the board rooms of bp conocophillips or exxon
9127109 if shes in the pocket of big oil shes kept it a pretty good secret
9127110 its a good partnership if you consider having to sue your partner constantly to pay you a good thing
9127111 she has stood up to the big players when she didnt like the process and i dont think its played well with the industry
9127112 the agenda of alaska and the agenda of exxon are not always the same
9127113 they may both want more production but it may not be under the same terms
9127114 and this is the way a novel gets written in ignorance fear sorrow madness and a kind of psychotic happiness as an incubator for the wonders being born
9127115 a comforting acquaintance hope a contagious thing like spring inebriating like lager
9127116 from beginning to end this has been a very rough experience
9127117 there will be a lot of people who will benefit from this now and unfortunately in the future
9127118 after the sacrifice i made i felt a little bit abandoned by the government
9127119 certain kinds of organisms have been known to get in and not necessarily cause any harm
9127120 and this is the way a novel gets written in ignorance fear sorrow madness and a kind of psychotic happiness as an incubator for the wonders being born
9127121 i want people here to know that im gonna be fighting as hard as i can for them and joe biden is gonna be fighting as hard as he can for them to create new jobs in high growth industries like clean energy
9127122 were trying to talk now with the companies buyers retailers wholesalers to bring things back into balance
9127123 theres a real pressure out there on growers that goes beyond what the science justifies
9127124 we have two extraordinary resources in this area wildlife and our agricultural community
9127125 its our position that you dont need to destroy one in order to save the other and thats what were working on doing
9127126 i had been thinking a lot about the overlap of music and theology the way a lot of good music raises perennial theological questions but in a more succinct way than we theologians often do
9127127 if you have an idea that keeps nagging you and you are afraid it will fail do it
9127128 powerful celebration of where we see god at work in the world
9127129 its part theology lecture part cultural analysis part old time radio show part conversation and part good music
9127130 i have found that many people deeply resonate with the idea a lot of musicians have been really taken with it
9127131 tokens of the work of god in all sorts of cultural artifacts regardless of whether they were written by believers
9127132 discerning signs has to do with comprehending the remarkable in common happenings
9127133 to behold tokens of the reality of the resurrection or hope where others are consigned to confusion or despair
9127134 when we launched the show seven months ago we had no idea it would become so popular so quickly the next step is to make tokens available more widely
9127135 it kicks into the air with its legs then the wings take over
9127136 this reinforces that sen mccain wants to be the independent reformer change ticket hes not ceding that to sen obama
9127137 the fact that the womens vote is up for grabs did make a strong woman a plus on the ticket
9127138 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
9127139 leaving the baby in the bushes like that if the baby hadnt been found it probably wouldnt have survived for long
9127140 it was a game of hide and go seek that turned into a day of reckoning
9127141 its a hard grape to grow as you know right its uh its thin skinned temperamental ripens early its you know its not a survivor like cabernet which can just grow anywhere and thrive even when its neglected no pinot needs constant care and attention you know and in fact it can only grow in these really specific little tucked away corners of the world and only the most patient and nurturing of growers can do it really only somebody who really takes the time to understand pinots potential can then coax it into its fullest expression
9127142 if you wanna take the long cut well get there eventually
9127143 you can put me down as shocked and surprised and like ok why
9127144 said rey trevi o 51 a democratic delegate from lytle
9127145 just because she palin is a woman doesnt mean shes a candidate for us
9127146 a small percentage of hillary supporters might be engaged in supporting the woman just because she is a woman
9127147 but overall people who supported hillary because of her ideals supported her because they were democratic ideals not because she is a woman
9127148 we had geraldine ferraro as our vice presidential pick in 1984 at least she was a congresswoman and everyone knew who she was
9127149 you do have a candidate who is 72 years of age and a vice presidential candidate who is literally one heartbeat away
9127150 all i can say is they must be really really worried about barack obamas appeal
9127151 a lot of the women were in favor of hillary clinton because of her stance on issues that are important to women
9127152 im very proud to be an elected official whos a woman but just having ovaries doesnt qualify you for anything
9127153 i am suffering because of something and i dont deserve it it isnt fair
9127154 yeah well life isnt fair so youd better get used to it
9127155 art amp soul is dialed in to practically everything that makes oakland great
9127156 a rich and original collection of catchy and brainy folk pop
9127157 art amp soul has burst onto the scene as northern californias multicultural mecca of music art and food with the most wonderfully fun diverse festival crowd you will find anywhere
9127158 a historic moment for women and for the republican party as well as a choice guaranteed to energize values voters this is a grand slam home run for john mccain
9127159 i believe we now have the most pro life ticket in history running on the most pro life platform in history
9127160 gov palins credentials as a leader include taking on political corruption and reducing spending but her promises of change were not just words they became actions and her concern for country has been passed down to her five children her oldest son track joined the army last year on the sixth anniversary of the september 11th attacks and is serving his country
9127161 all conservatives should be proud to support this historic ticket of proven reformers with records of self sacrifice for their country and their families
9127162 we simply cannot say whether or not they were caught up in this appalling fire
9127163 he is a sociable dad and just likes hanging out with his boys maybe he is also getting them in the swing of things so they can take over the business when they get older
9127164 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction
9127165 i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation
9127166 david has been accused of being a sex addict which i always found very exciting
9127167 trust me i am all woman mario and i have got a lot of catching up to in the bedroom
9127168 dont worry about me ive had a great time and im 25 000 richer
9127169 how can i complain i have more money than i have ever seen in my life and i can see mario well be making up for lost time
9127170 ive been on cloud nine ever since mario proposed i couldnt believe it when i saw him hes made me the happiest woman alive i cant believe its finally my turn to marry my prince and now i can have my dream wedding
9127171 any couple would find it hard not to have had a few rows in that house
9127172 nicole obviously had stuff on her mind that she wanted to get off her chest but she couldnt i think she handled herself really well their arguments were a bit petty but when you are that young you do get insecure about things
9127173 of course we wanted to do what couples do especially at night when we were lying next to each other we will be making the most of being alone now
9127174 if the rapist was a migrant we fear he may well have already gone possibly to england or to another french port it is also possible hes gone to belgium or the netherlands
9127175 conditions in the camp are very hard the occupants sole aim is to secure passage to britain the people there mostly men have an illegal status they have no job and no home the jungle is a dangerous place and it is not safe to go there
9127176 the prosecutor said he cant say whether the rapist was an illegal immigrant or not but they do know he spoke fluent french
9127177 this suggests he was not actually an illegal immigrant but someone else who was in the wood at that time as most illegal immigrants dont speak french
9127178 he should rot in hell he can do what he wants he has hobbies and a tv and the gym and meals every day he lives the life of riley
9127179 i do not have a violent bone in my body and to take a life i would have thought would be the ultimate form of aggression
9127180 i just know in my heart that one day my innocence will be proved and i will be able to go home to try and rebuild my life wherever that home may be
9127181 we are now travelling from edinburgh to ottawa via new york it cost around 1 000 for the flights
9127182 the other airlines are quoting 2 500 and we just cant do it
9127183 contain a transformative power and healing energy by singing these prayers and expressing a full range of emotions through our voices we join a stream of consciousness and devotion that has been flowing for centuries

9127185 fundingposts perfect venture conference in new york was simply amazing
9127186 can we afford the overhead to operate for another two quarters without funding while i cold call and knock on locked doors seeking a face to face with anyone who will give our business an honest listen
9127187 the perfect venture conference ii was everything implied by its name the conference was well staffed with investor professionals from both angel groups and venture capitalists firms the sharing of their experiences was valuable however the larger value was the ability of the conference organizers to give you exposure in every session throughout the two and a half days never before have i experienced this level of exposure consistently throughout the event i would highly recommend this event for early fund raising activities for any start up
9127188 the contacts and potential partners we have made as a direct result of fundingposts conference were invaluable as a result of our conversations with the participating companies we have developed critical relationships with lead members of several potential channel partners that will come alongside us to launch our business commercially in addition we have become a more attractive funding target for both institutional and angel money as a direct result of this conference we have further solidified our go to market strategy as a result of the conference and other conversations we have had with participants again you guys i cant thank you enough i would have paid 15k if i knew that this is what i would have gotten out of it

9127190 im often asked what i think is the most important thing a start up company can have when searching for funding for their company
9127191 i was a little hesitant to invest money to attend fundingposts
9127192 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris tonight friday august 29th due to illness she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert

9127195 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9127196 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9127197 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9127198 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9127199 i have been fired i will be making a statement later
9127200 we are determined to do everything possible to promote long term stability and fairness in the housing market
9127201 the international credit crunch has created significant challenges not just for the uk housing market but in other parts of europe and the united states
9127202 we are looking at a wide range of options to further support the housing market in the current climate working closely with industry and lenders what form that support will take will be announced in due course
9127203 a mortgage rescue scheme would give people facing repossession the lifeline they desperately need and allow them to stay in their home
9127204 repossession should always be a last resort and the government must play their part in helping people to stay in their home during these difficult economic times
9127205 the army will not stage a coup the political crisis should be resolved by political means
9127206 it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9127207 i know this sounds hokey but basketball was a life changing experience for me
9127208 its all about setting a goal about discipline teamwork and then success
9127209 shes just been able to get in with issues and get press on it and she knows sort of what the public wants to hear and has been able to place her positions around those sort of issues that are important to people here the values that are important to people here
9127210 i dont think you can underestimate her as a politician
9127211 windows could not search for new updtes error code 80070424
9127212 cheaper than having to rent a plane for every shoot
9127213 he was really working the room going from one table to the next to see which girls he could get hold of
9127214 they are certainly one of the most talented teams in the nation if not the most talented team
9127215 jare has the ability to make plays when the protection breaks down
9127216 i really believe that is one of his strong suits one word i have used to describe him is
9127217 tony has worked very hard this spring and summer and he has put himself in position to help this team on the offensive end
9127218 first woman to serve in two different cabinet positions in the administrations of two presidents
9127219 i saw e mails from independent investigator stephen branchflower two days ago to the department of law saying its time to schedule a deposition of the governor her chief of staff and the attorney general who had some contact with the case
9127220 gesturetek inc a leading edge company who owns the patent on computer human interfacing through video cameras created groundfx by applying their video analysis to floor projection their ability to track peoples movements and actions allows groundfx multimedia content to be controlled and manipulated by simply stepping up to and onto the projection
9127221 initial investigation point it out to be a case of suicide
9127222 the police have requested for permission to conduct a viscera test on the deceased the police do not want to leave anything to chance and we are probing all angles
9127223 the time between discovery of the body and the time of death can also throw some light on the case the time gap is important and if was long then it is certainly questionable
9127224 nothing suspicious has emerged so far and suicide is the most strong line of investigation but the reason for that needs to be established
9127225 even the girls personal diary has not revealed anything much there is no concrete evidence to support that she was under depression
9127226 the issue of sanctions is not something we dont care about
9127227 stop stop and again stop it is necessary to do everything to stop this escalation or soon the soon black sea will overflow its shores with foreign warships
9127228 there is no need to simplify the conflict it is serious difficult but its as important as ever to think about how to live in europe how to build a united europe
9127229 i wont bet on it but at least i hope that european leaders will be able to rise above their emotions and seriously take stock of the perspective of a strategic partnership with russia
9127230 sooner or later monday or later they will be forced to ask themselves whether the current cooling of relations with russia is too big a price to pay for supporting the actions of the georgian leadership
9127231 when i was preparing a proposal for centre for civil society ccs the producer of the film i already knew one of the protagonists in my film amma an 85 year old tibetan refugee she does not speak she seems to have been silenced by the trauma of losing her dear ones and her land
9127232 tibetans face critical challenges to adapt themselves to new cultures and face challenges in earning their day to day livelihood
9127233 the objectives of the festival are to document livelihood challenges and bring it to the attention of the public media and policy makers
9127234 i visited the tibetan settlements time and again before a month of research but found that tibetans were apprehensive of outsiders and shy to face the camera the impact of the political tension and police pressure was apparent
9127235 amidst this i came across my second protagonist pasang a women in her seventies who owned a roadside tea shop she was excited to share her sentiments about the ongoing struggle for tibetans and her journey to make her life in india
9127236 the issue of the tibetans who have taken on the identity of refugees across the world is a social and economic challenge but only has a political solution
9127237 if the chinese economy is measured at a scale equal to the sea the impact of a frog jumping into the sea can almost be ignored
9127238 preparations for the games have undoubtedly boosted beijings economic and social development however the citys gdp accounts for a tiny part of chinas total so people should not overestimate the impact
9127239 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
9127240 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
9127241 preterm premature babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
9127242 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
9127243 of the total polling stations 24 have been identified as hyper sensitive and 36 as sensitive
9127244 the objective was to make at least one person from each of the 80 532 households in the city e literate we met 93 5 percent of the target the declaration is now being made as the city crossed 90 percent
9127245 the fee per head was rs 120 the corporation provided rs 80 while the rest was paid by the trainee
9127246 as were faced with the impact of higher energy costs and the lack of availability of credit thats going to put more pressure on the consumer sector
9127247 we have set up a new facility to work on integrated circuit ic development microcontroller development tools and corporate information systems
9127248 the india centre will play a major role in developing eight bit 16 bit and 32 bit microcontrollers and digital signal controllers we have delivered many innovations in microcontroller and digital signal controller designs besides digital power and motor control solutions
9127249 the statistics show a dangerous trend the scenario is quite fearsome
9127250 bangalore is one of indias fastest growing cities but it is sad that a modern city like bangalore with the best of amenities witnesses a rapid rise in suicide deaths
9127251 in bangalore all are stressed out be it a child an it professional or a migrant labour the city does not provide social and mental security to its wide range of population
9127252 most of our callers suffer from stress and a sense of loneliness and deprivation often we counsel the callers over the phone and if one is ready to visit us personally we encourage them to do so till date we have counselled around 3 600 persons
9127253 work related insecurity extended working hours and stringent deadlines contribute to rising number of suicides in the city no one has time for anyone we are all becoming very very self centric severing us from all human bonding and love thus a sense of insecurity is driving many to end their lives
9127254 my worry has nothing to do with peoples skin colour but whether those people are integrating and accepting the customs and cultures of this country
9127255 the problem comes when you have large numbers of people of all ethnicities who are not willing to use the language who are abusing our system and demand laws are changed to accommodate them
9127256 many of the people in the figures will be black british or asian british through and through from the third and fourth generations who are setting an example of integration to other ethnicities
9127257 this provides a delightful snapshot of life in multicultural britain its great that were now finally learning to live alongside each other
9127258 nadir was reportedly discovered at the schools swimming pool at around 5 30 p m by the swimming coach
9127259 we dropped him at school around 4 for his daily coaching the tuition classes were conducted in the school itself
9127260 later we received a call from the school telling us that his body was found floating in the pool and they had rushed him to the sahi hospital where doctors declared him brought dead
9127261 the school authorities dont have an answer to how he went inside the locked swimming pool where he was later discovered by their own swimming coach when he opened the pool
9127262 as the pool was locked the only possibility seems that he somehow scaled the wall and went in the pool and ultimately drowned but even that is the school authorities negligence
9127263 he was a bright student he wanted to become an engineer and help his family
9127264 the biggest loser season 6 will be husband and wife teams competing with parent and child teams
9127265 the one thing we practiced and preached before this season was play the game hard but dont play the game with the scale do the best you can every week on the scale and let the game come secondary the contestants this season really took that to heart
9127266 the biggest loser season 6 is scheduled to air tuesday september 16 at 8 00 pm et and if you cant wait that long visit
9127267 interaccess is a not for profit artist run centre that enables artists and the general public to explore the intersections of art and technology
9127268 id never heard of him but thats how it goes sometimes he did well and made me work hard today
9127269 i was never really in danger so it was actually pretty good for me i knew the longer the match would go the more tired he would get so it was was a good match
9127270 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches
9127271 i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9127272 but sometimes its more exciting for the fans and a little more stressful for the people in my box but as long as you win thats what matters
9127273 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognisant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9127274 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9127275 the current response from the state department has virtually made narendra modi a persona non grata to the us
9127276 to abandon the politicians and politics of division and hate as embodied by narendra modi and embrace the ideals of gujarats greatest hero mahatma gandhi
9127277 by persistently inviting the most notorious human rights abuser in india and propping narendra modi as their icon and hero the organisers of the world gujarati conference have brought shame to the indian american community and have tarnished the name of india
9127278 it is vital that responsible nsg states stand their ground
9127279 some indian officials have threatened they may walk away from the deal if the nsg establishes even if the most basic requirements if that occurs so be it
9127280 the revised proposal will likely only pay lip service to the other nsg states concerns
9127281 to their great credit approximately 20 nsg members rejected giving india the blank cheque it desires at an aug 21 22 meeting of the group
9127282 including termination of nuclear trade if india resumes testing and a ban on the transfer of enrichment or reprocessing technology
9127283 incredibly us officials are resisting even these most basic measures
9127284 some would like to see all the provisions of the hyde act legislated in some international fashion we dont think that is the right way
9127285 if nsg states agree under pressure from an outgoing us administration to blow a hole in nsg guidelines in order to allow a few states to profit from nuclear trade with india
9127286 no expliques no hace falta haz click otra vez y l nzate al vac o no hay nada peor que permanecer en el borde mirando
9127287 we really cannot talk for long because if i let him be upset for too long he gets diarrhea
9127288 i guess hes really creating a lot of pressure down there
9127289 soft tissues of the rectum tear and make cradles for the demon virus to grow
9127290 to ease constipation add oat or wheat bran to anything you can think of cereal yogurt smoothies or even spaghetti sauce
9127291 we will be staging two of our senior championship matches tomorrow and we will be hosting our press conference in tandem with these fixtures
9127292 we are obviously exited by this team management appointment and we are looking ahead with optimism
9127293 all of the theories are based on circumstantial evidence and a lot of supposition
9127294 thats why being another theory i dont think this is jack the ripper but it cant be ruled out
9127295 i dont know that digging up people on a speculative basis would be appropriate
9127296 it is possible we might still find out one day who jack the ripper was it is equally possible that no one will ever know
9127297 well if theres no god i might as well go out on a killing rampage
9127298 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness because that which is known about god is evident within them for god made it evident to them for since the creation of the world his invisible attributes his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse for even though they knew god they did not honor him as god or give thanks but they became futile in their speculations and their foolish heart was darkened professing to be wise they became fools
9127299 happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones
9127300 and thou shalt eat the fruit of thy womb the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters which the lord thy god shall give thee
9127301 the psni have a key role to play in tackling issues such as antisocial behaviour and criminality which mainly impacts on working class areas
9127302 sinn feins representatives on the down district policing partnership will provide a voice for communities who have in the past experienced bad policing and neglect
9127303 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
9127304 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
9127305 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
9127306 we are out to look if we find the right players we will do it one or two
9127307 however i believe its more interesting for us to focus on our strengths and quality rather than looking outside i know it makes headlines but it doesnt make you win games
9127308 i buy the players i feel strengthen the squad after that i consider the price
9127309 i do the job i think it has to be done considering the resources of the club and considering our ambition and the players we have
9127310 there will be some long difficult trips but we want to cope with it and of course come out of it
9127311 if she doesnt get home on time im not sure whats going to happen now we were looking forward to her coming home for one week before she goes to university in dundee
9127312 i tried to phone calgary airport today but all the lines are busy i tried to ring zooms phone lines but their offices are closed its a long weekend here in calgary for labour day so all the hotels are getting booked out as well
9127313 we are trying to make as many passengers as possible aware of their options in terms of alternative flights and the possibility of securing refunds for the flights they booked with zoom
9127314 as things stand there is good availability of alternative flights as we have passed the main holiday period we believe the majority of passengers who booked with us should be able to secure an alternative flight
9127315 we have been in contact with other airlines including ba virgin and flyglobespan in particular and they have made clear the availability of alternative flights
9127316 we would like to reassure people that every possible effort was made to save the airline and safeguard flights and it was only very late in the day when the actions of suppliers and creditors made it impossible to continue
9127317 this failure in a tough economic climate along with numerous other airline failures this year highlights the importance of having financial protection in place when you book flights
9127318 it hasnt been a great start by us so far i would say
9127319 we had a good win against ballymena last week but then lost to distillery a couple of days later
9127320 i think we were a wee bit hard done by and a couple of refereeing decisions didnt go our way but thats another story
9127321 i think we need to be a bit tighter its not like us to concede three goals against anyone and if we do that we are going to be punished even more
9127322 we seem to be going through a stage where we arent starting to play until we go a goal behind and thats dangerous we did it against ballymena last week
9127323 we need to start better and score first ourselves to maybe settle us down
9127324 you cant let other teams get a head start especially a team like glentoran because they will just shut up shop and we wont be able to get through them
9127325 its always a good hard game when we play them and we like going to the oval
9127326 its a good place to play football because the pitch is big and always in great condition and it really suits us
9127327 the game could be just what we need as well
9127328 we havent really played that well so far and we know that there is a lot more to come from us its just up to the boys ion the team to step up a level
9127329 its going to be a hard match and we are treating it as one game not one that is going to have any bearing on the league
9127330 i dont know why we are always under pressure to buy 30 40 millionplayers im under pressure to buy good players its as simple as that talent is not always necessarily linked to the price of a player
9127331 dac ma njuri pe blog la tine nu comenta pe blog la mine
9127332 four finalists in the ring and all of them losers im not surprised dictator castro is hot under the collar he slammed the judges as corrupt not corrupt i say just impotent and unfit for the job
9127333 in one contest alone i counted a dozen good punches on target half of them uppercuts and not one was scored clearly after 20 years of dubious worth push button scoring must be accepted as a proven failure the system lacks credibility and should be scrapped
9127334 back then we had freedom of expression and imagination and were our own men
9127335 now our best boys box to rule poking out pitter patter punches to the head and face that wouldnt crack an egg
9127336 not only is a proud sport being suffocated by a suspect scoring system but how many boxers favour the compulsory use of headgear very few for certain and its an eyesore and thorn in the flesh of many
9127337 for an irish champion of young paddy barnes calibre not to be awarded a scoring point against shiming of china was absurd probably the most shameful verdict of the entire beijing games
9127338 paddy was beaten and knows it but landed half a dozen or more good punches that everybody saw but the judges
9127339 if two weeks of cheating and chicanery in seoul forced boxing to clean up its act the judging in beijing was the poorest in my book since nearly 20 referees and judges were sacked at the rome games of 1960 one of them an irishman
9127340 its not enough to say that some of the scoring has been outrageous it has gone beyond that its as though they are trying to destroy boxing in the games how come so many good shots are not being registered
9127341 ill play anywhere as long as i make the starting fifteen
9127342 no mickey harte expects us all to work hard and keep the pressure on the opposition
9127343 in the modern game half forwards are expected to play like half backs and vice versa you have to be prapred to lap the pitch plenty of times its all about work rate and commitment as well as skill of course
9127344 we were determined to bounce back against down following that hammering we took from dublin and then when we went on to beat armagh our confidence was further boosted
9127345 not many of us saw tomorrows clash coming it just shows how strong tyrone are
9127346 we seem to play well against northern teams but we dont want to jinx ourselves
9127347 we beat tyrone in the league semi final in 2005
9127348 they went on to win the all ireland and that gave us great belief
9127349 it has taken a good few years for us to get where we want to be
9127350 we still dont think we have reached our full potential hopefully we can go out and express ourselves and things will click and well be looking to the forwards to do the business
9127351 we feel if we can get good quick ball to the boys up front then they will have the penetration to trouble tyrone and maybe keep them on the back foot
9127352 that would be our aim but it certainly wont be easy to achieve given the very confident manner in which tyrone disposed of dublin
9127353 its one of those games where there is a lot of tension involved and it brings a little bit of pressure on everybody in the game not just the referee
9127354 the referees will handle that situation i think this whole situation has been blown out of proportion a little bit
9127355 in all the time that ive been involved the referees and linesmen have always made errors the same way that players and managers make errors as well
9127356 there is a lot of tension in the old firm games and the referees have to experience it and learn how to handle it and im sure on sunday the game will be handled very well
9127357 the referees have a tough job as we all do at different times and we just have to get on with it
9127358 its difficult now because of the scrutiny they are under in terms of television and aspects of the media but it happens everywhere and referees and linesmen just have to improve and cut out their errors in the same way that managers and players have to do to keep their position
9127359 if we look at that aspect of the league last season it was fairly even
9127360 both teams will have to try to turn that on its head this year
9127361 any time you go to celtic park you expect an extremely difficult game and we will get that
9127362 historically rangers and celtic dont lose a lot of home games at home and if you do theres trouble
9127363 celtic have an excellent home record not just in league games but also in european games over the last five or 10 years
9127364 its always a difficult place to go to and win as is ibrox
9127365 i dont think you can draw any great conclusions other than you get a great psychological lift if you can manage to get a good result at either ground
9127366 a number of our players are experienced players and the experienced ones handle it
9127367 theyve played in important games big games throughout their careers so they know what to expect
9127368 of the younger ones they just have to learn i hope they handle it okay
9127369 its an experience and its a good experience for most footballers
9127370 you want to be involved in big games and a rangers celtic game is certainly a big one
9127371 once he settles down he will show that he is ready to make an impact for us
9127372 we will see how he is tomorrow he has just flown in today and done a little bit of light training
9127373 we will see how he is for the game on sunday but i think it would be asking a lot for anyone to just fly in like that and be involved in a game of such importance
9127374 it looks as though we will be reasonably settled with the squad we have
9127375 a couple of years ago the council decided that the union flag would fly over the civic centre only on specific days which were agreed among the parties
9127376 this flag is based on the union flag and therefore in my view contravenes the policy when it came to a vote on the olympics flag unionists supported it and nationalists voted against and unionists won the day
9127377 there was also a choice of a plain olympics flag that did not incorporate the union flag and i proposed this one could be flown but i was out voted the council had an opportunity to show leadership and to send out a signal to the nationalist population but again it failed
9127378 this is typical of sinn fein councillors they are totally opposed to all things british and when the commission which usually finds in their favour actually opposed them they react like spoilt children
9127379 neil hasnt signed an extension to his contract no but we have spoken about it and have agreed that he will at some stage
9127380 its not that there is any deliberating its more to do with the fact that we just havent had the time to actually sit down and put pen to paper
9127381 he has been playing well and of course scoring golas so it has been a decent start to the season for him so far
9127382 we were more embarassed than anything else last saturday just by the way things happened and how quickly it happened
9127383 apart from that 20 minute spell i didnt see a lot in the side that would cause me a great deal of concern the goals were avoidable but those things can be fixed
9127384 i told everyone that would listen that i would make my judgement on the team once the games began in earnest its not about their ability thats not in question
9127385 again seems to be fine following her win at leopardstown and she should have a good chance at the curragh
9127386 even though johnny murtagh doesnt ride because he is suspended i still feel that again is very much in the favourites slot
9127387 finsceal beo seems very well and this would appear to be a very good opportunity for her
9127388 marty quinn has us fired up and we believe in ourselves
9127389 we are going into every game with nothing to lose people expect us to get beaten every time we run out but the players arent thinking that way
9127390 we are always underdogs but that takes the pressure off us if we went on to win the league no one would be more shocked than us but all we can do is keep targeting that top six spot before the league splits and see where we end up
9127391 the club backroom staff and manager have been great to me and im happy to be part of a side which is playing as a team and hungry to do well
9127392 with so many players coming to the club it takes time for the team to gel but we will improve and we will get fitter
9127393 i know aaron black from my spell at larne and glenavon and crusaders are a very dangerous side
9127394 this will be another huge test for us but we want to keep performing well at home and we wont be letting higher expectations go to our head i still havent lost to glenavon since i have left them and hopefully we can maintain our good start against crusaders from one to 16 all our players have been outstanding
9127395 there was a problem with the flight company and there were a couple of flight changes but it was nothing too serious
9127396 it all worked out in the end and i got in about 10 30am
9127397 im excited to be here its what ive been waiting for over the last few weeks now that everything is finalised im happy
9127398 definitely im here now ive had a little jog and got the legs going again so i will be fine im ready
9127399 ive seen a couple of games and i spoke to maurice johnston a little bit about it and he explained how great a game it is how competitive it is and how big the rivalry is
9127400 his advice was just to be prepared go out there and play my game and to enjoy the atmosphere and the experience
9127401 i dont know whats been finalised yet but hopefully i will be in the squad and play a part in the game
9127402 the mls is still a league that is developing although the level of play has increased
9127403 but this is a team who play in the uefa cup and the champions league and who play against the best players in the world
9127404 for me its a big step and i think it was the right choice for me to come here
9127405 playing with good players every day and getting good coaching and training is going to help me grow as a player and develop which is important to me
9127406 it was the right step for me to come here
9127407 im a box to box midfielder i can get in on tackles and break up plays but at the same time i can get the occasional goal
9127408 i think i can bring something to the midfield and benefit the team
9127409 yeah he says but this guy i know never does anything with the information he gets he could send out an email once a month and let his customers know about his monthly special or you could send out an email with a daily or weekly special at the cafe
9127410 the whole purpose in writing the book was to write a positive story and to acknowledge that donovan had a full life
9127411 the temptation is to write something very emotional but i tried to channel my emotion and record the reality of an ordinary fella growing up in derry in extraordinary circumstances
9127412 he lived each day fully for each day he loved watching the matches derry city celtic man utd he met nadine coyle one day manager of football clubs other days he never played up on it the moment was the moment and once it was over it was over
9127413 we took him to a couple of matches in england and after all the preparations he would watch the match and then just want to go home afterwards
9127414 he was no saint and growing up in derry he had his own views he cursed like mad at football he drank two wkds and thought that was him full he would not have seen himself as any different just before he passed away he seemed to find some energy and started a fanzine for derry city fc artistically he was very very good and won a credit union competition when he was 10 or 11 and he did art pieces for gcse
9127415 im acknowledging its not easy we are trying to find a way thorugh and look at his examples way of living to live in a new way we dont want to forget him
9127416 at four donovan was diagnosed with the muscle wasting condition and we are fully aware there are a number of children in derry and donegal with that at the moment their journey will be completely different there is a lot of research since donovan was young
9127417 donovan would have went on teenage weekends to the hospice many people think of a hospice as a place of dying but to him and most young people it was to do with life enjoyment mixing with peers sitting up until 2 or 3am doing activities the luxury of doing ordinary things
9127418 when you look at the way they ended armaghs hopes you have every reason for thinking that they will represent a very stiff test for us
9127419 its great to be starting against wexford but you have to produce the goods in this tyrone side at the minute there is a lot of competition for places and we have players on the bench who are more than capable of coming in and doing an excellent job
9127420 there are three matches on the croke park programme tomorrow but it will be a real bonanza occasion if tyrone win two of them that is
9127421 dreadlocked hunchbacks cowering under anonymous smoke and fickle neon landscapes of commerce and graffiti ghosts of hippie gods resplendent and reiterated
9127422 i wasnt at all interested in photography so i was mildly perplexed as to why i was being given this gift
9127423 as i figured out what to do with this thing i became fascinated in the camera as a machine i couldnt put it down it became my passion i was driven to figure out how i might exist in the world through that camera
9127424 i see photography as a means to provide a window into a set of cultural experiences
9127425 at the time i started taking pictures there were few african american photographers chronicling the black existence what much of the world saw about african american culture was through specific and largely negative stereotypes common to that time but what i saw were elegant self possessed people and by taking their picture i wanted to present the world with an aesthetic sense of the true african american experience i wanted to capture that sense of community and i wanted to bring my own voice to the sociocultural history of harlem
9127426 i personally dont think that modern adolescents are properly represented in much of photography
9127427 either their images are used as a marketing tool in consumer culture or they are representative of drug problems or other cultural cliches
9127428 i wanted to highlight the individual to make each portrait a voice that was representative to their culture
9127429 so i combined their thoughts with their images to get a richer representation beyond what either medium the written word or the photograph could convey
9127430 what i ended up with is a collection of portraits that extended beyond the frame and across all lines of cultural social sexual or ethnic differences
9127431 a subtle change in the track could change that significantly
9127432 there is some uncertainty as to where it will make its exact landfall
9127433 thats what the cone of error is designed to take into account
9127434 unfortunately i think that people living in new orleans should mark the anniversary of katrina by getting the heck out of the city
9127435 we have not made a decision for any sort of mass evacuations
9127436 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9127437 its a possibility we live with as residents of mississippi
9127438 and superior in that the offensive smell of infusions was eliminated
9127439 as they capture mosquitoes that have had a blood meal and thus more opportunity to become infected
9127440 each female mosquito has the potential to produce about 200 eggs and she can have as many as five cycles so when we capture a gravid mosquito that can remove as many as 500 females
9127441 sampling the species in urban environments has been a challenge until studies on its oviposition cues allowed the development of gravid female traps that collect mostly females that previously have blood fed and therefore had a chance to become infected
9127442 to not only us but third world countries where culex quinquefasciatus is a problem
9127443 we want to know how the brain areas that encode memory are organized
9127444 if your memory is affected by aging or alzheimers disease is there a way to learn that can capitalize on the brain structures that may still be working well
9127445 we found that if e2f3a is present the animals can develop normally through adulthood even when all the other genes are absent
9127446 if the e2f3a gene was doing something unique replacing it with one of the others should prevent development
9127447 we conclude from this that it is the genes location in the genome plus the timing and level of its activity that makes it so important during development
9127448 organisms above insects have multiple e2fs and these findings dont tell us what the others are doing
9127449 we surmise that the other genes are required for adult survival under the stressful conditions in the wild we are investigating that now
9127450 one approach to restore auditory function is to replace defective cells with healthy new cells
9127451 our work shows that it is possible to produce functional auditory hair cells in the mammalian cochlea
9127452 it remains to be determined whether gene transfer into a deaf mouse will lead to the production of healthy cells that enable hearing however we have made an important step toward defining an approach that may lead to therapeutic intervention for hearing loss
9127453 because of the large deformation signals from the dike intrusion we needed to do some detailed detective work to prove the existence of this slow earthquake
9127454 we used state of the art insar satellite data to constrain the dike source and that allowed us to demonstrate the existence of the slow earthquake motions recorded by the gps stations on kilaueas flank
9127455 a dike intrusion could be seen with the seismic monitoring network the tiltmeters and the gps network but these slow earthquakes can only be seen with the gps network
9127456 these slow earthquakes are an interesting phenomenon that has only been studied within the last decade and were still trying to figure out how they fall into the bigger picture of earthquakes says cecily wolfe also an associate professor in higp and another co author
9127457 theyre definitely a part of the earthquakes cycle and trying to understand how they relate to other earthquakes and how they may be generated and triggered will give us greater insights into how predicable earthquakes are
9127458 although we have a significant armament of therapeutic agents against hiv factors that dictate the pharmacokinetics of anti hiv drugs need to be accounted for in order to have haart efficacy in sequestered viral reservoirs several p gp inhibitors are currently under clinical trial however very little is being done to target the mrp transporters
9127459 our studies using the anti hiv drugs saquinavir and zidovudine clearly implicated that inhibition of mrps rather than p gp would be a more beneficial approach to facilitate the entry of haart drugs into the sub endothelial reservoirs of hiv especially within the brain unpublished findings from our laboratory suggest that similar to mk 571 other leukotriene receptor antagonists e g montelukast singulairtm and zafirlukast accolatetm can suppress mrp mediated efflux of these anti hiv drugs as well we believe that adjunct therapy with these clinically approved mrp inhibitors may improve haart efficacy in hiv positive patients deter the selection of drug resistance and delay the progression of aids
9127460 this study by dr mondal and colleagues has crucial implications in the persistence of sub endothelial hiv reservoirs and will be important to the development of future therapies
9127461 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism
9127462 we found that some 25 percent of the genes in our model organism appear to be under clock control i wasnt suspecting anything remotely like that
9127463 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signaling processes
9127464 but perhaps the most important role weve seen so far is the clocks role in ribosome biogenesis
9127465 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signaling pathways
9127466 the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems
9127467 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men
9127468 the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or lose of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight with an average body mass index of 38 they already were obese and become more insulin resistant
9127469 also patients with low testosterone and type 2 diabetes have been shown to have very high concentrations of c reactive protein
9127470 which increases their risk of developing atherosclerosis and heart disease above and beyond the risk associated with diabetes
9127471 while obesity contributes to the association of type 2 diabetes and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism hh the association is not dependent entirely on obesity
9127472 in our first study of diabetic men we found that 31 percent of lean type 2 diabetics also had hh so it is likely that factors other than obesity contribute to hh possibly insulin resistance
9127473 whether obesity or insulin resistance is the major determinant of hh has to be addressed in future studies and the pathogenesis of hh needs to be defined
9127474 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
9127475 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change
9127476 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse
9127477 we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
9127478 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
9127479 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them
9127480 while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families
9127481 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
9127482 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
9127483 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
9127484 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected
9127485 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that was going to tell me it was going to be like that
9127486 it just felt normal just one of those days where i made about a 15 footer on the first hole another on the second hole i just kind of built on that momentum

9127523 one hundred percent of the people i teach in their late 20s or 30s have no idea what a mortgage burning is this whole attitude of paying off the mortgage and owning the home free and clear is disappearing from the country increasingly it is a milestone that people do not expect to reach a new aarp national survey for example found that among workers 55 and older with mortgages about half doubted that they could pay them off before they retired
9127524 they have been doing that for a year and they really exposed us they have a nice scheme but we have to play better do what we are supposed to do and just play better everywhere

9127614 i am very disappointed in the united nations because they have not talked to this headquarters before they made that release
9127615 but what i believe is that we have to work together to find out what the facts are before we make public announcements
9127616 i am going to make an offer to the government and the united nations to participate in a joint investigation with the coalition to continue to look at the facts surrounding these allegations and to make sure that we have come as close as we can to everybody knowing the truth of what happened in azizabad

9127677 i believe this government cannot endure half slave and half free it must become all one thing or all the other
9127678 the difference between the republican and the democratic parties is that the former consider slavery a moral social and political wrong while the latter do not consider it either a moral social or political wrong
9127679 i am not in favor of negro citizenship i agree with judge douglas he is not my equal in many respects certainly not in color perhaps not in moral or intellectual endowment
9127680 no recorded debate in the english language surpassed those between lincoln and douglas for keen give and take vigorous saxon language and clear exposition of the vital issue
9127681 i wanted to do this and i proposed that but

9127699 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali
9127700 vista la grande enfasi e nello stesso tempo linconsistenza dei fatti a me attribuiti da panorama non vorrei che lartificiale creazione di questo caso politico alimentasse il tentativo o la tentazione di dare vita nel tempo pi breve possibile ad una legge sulle intercettazioni telefoniche che possa sottrarre alla magistratura uno strumento che in molti casi si dimostrato indispensabile per portare in luce azioni o accadimenti utili allo svolgimento delle funzioni che le sono proprie

9127716 trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he shall direct your paths
9127717 i saw things well tonight and as far as decision making goes it was good
9127718 on the throw to billy i probably needed to let it go a little more aggressively and thats what mike was letting me know
9127719 all good quarterbacks throw picks and they score touchdowns and the really good ones are a point better than they are bad alex has to learn that and the only way hes going to learn it is by what he did today
9127720 we got our young players a lot of experience in some interesting situations i know its the last preseason game but for those guys they look up there and its a three point game and theyre trying to find a way to win they misplay a ball and we get a chance to win the game
9127721 to make a play at the end to win the game thats fun for sure
9127722 i just tried to put it where only he could get it and he was able to make a great catch his eyes were really big
9127723 the plan was to get a couple of three and outs and then take the players out but it didnt turn out that way we didnt play well
9127724 ive been on the other side of the rep situation
9127725 trust me i know what its like when you dont get a lot of chances to compete obviously its not good when people stop correcting your mistakes or paying any attention to you obviously its no fun getting fired
9127726 you get fired and its in the news and everyone knows about it
9127727 as ive said all along weve got three quarterbacks battling for the position all right three guys
9127728 i tried twice to get osullivan out of the way didnt i
9127729 i was the new guy in detroit last year and i understand how coach martz will sometimes coach all of his quarterbacks through one player
9127730 ive been there but i really believe that coach martz if he thinks youre giving everything youve got and learning in the process hell give you the keys to success i just want to be in that position
9127731 maybe manners not the most sexy word i like his
9127732 i loved it when wed play a school from a more prominent conference you had a bunch of guys who thought im pretty sure i was good enough to play at this school but they didnt want me you get a whole group like that all of us with chips on our shoulders and its pretty powerful
9127733 je ne mattendais pas jouer ce niveau s tonne tsonga je suis un petit peu surpris m me si cest une surface qui me convient bien mais ce n tait pas un match de folie jai bien jou mais pas super bien non plus
9127734 je suis heureux je profite de chaque moment parfois m me quand je perdais un point j tais content je souriais
9127735 le show cest tout moi explique tsonga je prends mon pied dans ces ambiances l tant mieux si a marche ici

9127738 cela faisait longtemps que je cherchais retrouver mon niveau je crois que je lai retrouv peut tre m me un petit peu mieux quavant
9127739 theres just too many issues with this offense for people to deal with
9127740 we had two and a half weeks to deal with it the rest of these folks will get two days good luck acc
9127741 had dwyer in our sights about three times and just couldnt tackle him
9127742 we wanted to come out and give a great show for the fans and i think we did some great things on defense and some good things on offense
9127743 its a big ball game for this team and for south florida and an opportunity for us to go up there and play a great opponent
9127744 theyve got a tremendous offense tremendous defense and we feel great for the chance to go up there and play such a great team
9127745 things didnt happen the way we wanted but youve got to expect that out of any football game
9127746 especially when youre playing such a good opponent like miami
9127747 i put my teammates in positions that they could make plays not me
9127748 i learned if i could give the ball to my teammates everything will be ok i dont need to be the one going out there making spectacular plays
9127749 it felt like we had a junior or senior out there playing quarterback
9127750 an ideal vice president for mccain would have strong conservative credentials and appeal to non traditional gop constituencies such as women and minorities
9127751 grit and integrity and devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9127752 eloquent ghostcrawler as soon as the talents are actually implemented the following is the build ill be trying for
9127753 so i quit my hit show and yada yada yada im selling computers
9127754 in den n chsten sieben bis acht jahren wird sich der brasilianische fahrzeugmarkt verdoppeln
9127755 umso wichtiger werden f r uns die bric l nder brasilien russland indien und china mit denen wir einen gewissen ausgleich f r die us schw che schaffen
9127756 der markt brasilien ist gesund und noch viel kraft f r die n chsten jahre auch wenn das wachstum sich leicht abschw chen wird
9127757 if i were to see his book on a shelf in my local bookstore i would definitely give it a shot
9127758 but i would say there is purpose for our lives before and beyond ones adherence to a particular faith
9127759 it would have taken too many chemicals and too much water to change its appearance so i decided to use the tarp method
9127760 we did apply a small amount of herbicide to get things started
9127761 bermuda grass or wire grass is extremely hardy you pull it and think youve got it all but its roots are extremely long and deep they can stretch for yards when it is broken off new plants start it has to be smothered to really go away
9127762 im sure the neighbors will be very glad to see the tarp go away since weve had it on the lawn for a year
9127763 within three weeks of removing the tarp the first time weeds sprouted
9127764 so we had to put it back for a little longer then it was effective
9127765 sod has a tough established root system which makes it harder for weeds to compete
9127766 everybody wants a beautiful lawn but i wanted to achieve it without loading the ground with excess chemicals
9127767 its been fascinating to see what we could do with a passive weed killing system
9127768 going green has been a lot less work than spending all that time and money using chemicals
9127769 i have had that so now i will leave no need to anticipate another date with sassy and have to up the ante i may not be able to top this date so i will stop while i am ahead
9127770 the company has to our knowledge the only pre established pristine compound with approximately 400 beds and a fully operational office with commercial kitchens and laundry facilities in the new orleans baton rouge area and we have been there since the work we performed during hurricane katrina as soon as the storm passes we believe we will be the first company able to assist in the recovery efforts to not only get our clients back in operation but others as well if you need our assistance please contact us at our 24 hour operational hot line 1 800 282 8701 we have helped many during many hurricanes katrina wilma charlie and ivan to name a few our baton rouge office is also open 24 hours a day 225 667 9388 our disaster recovery team is also available jeffery 516 779 7823 eric 516 779 7053 and myself 516 779 7816
9127771 you look at this and say boy i hope this thing doesnt really explode but it probably will
9127772 gustav is expected to be a large powerful hurricane as it approaches the northern gulf coast
9127773 isay for a hell of long time i wished that i had his photo memory how nice it would be to read a script once and remember it till you finished working on it no need of going back to it for reference every now and then
9127774 but this morning i heard it on outlook of bbc issac asimov has gone on record to say that he hated this abnormal memo
9127775 he says if his wife goes out for shopping and is late by ten minutes or so he gets too anxious and calls the police and hospitals in the area and that he cant forget the normal ordinary daily innocuous occurrences
9127776 hey this one here says alberto moravia is also a french writer
9127777 adaiyappaa he is an italian writer and wrote novels on realism in sexuality and dont think our ben is the first man to write openly on sex you should read his woman of rome
9127778 the fire is pretty much contained at this stage of the game but we need to know whats in the air
9127779 we live two miles away and it blew all the curtains in it was a force through my window that was pretty incredible
9127780 it was like someone shot a giant spotlight on us
9127781 there was a giant mushroom type cloud about 100 feet high and flames shooting from the building
9127782 i was just waiting on a customer and all of sudden i felt a big boom like an earthquake type deal
9127783 i could feel the explosion then i stepped out on the deck and could see the sky had lightened up
9127784 theres a crew that works there 24 hours a day
9127785 when youre working in a chemical plant you dont look forward for something like this but it certainly is a possibility when youre working with great volumes of chemicals
9127786 its not the first time weve ever had an explosion or an release or a fire
9127787 people in the plant are generally trained to deal with it
9127788 with waters coming up it gives the animals more room to get in trouble
9127789 fires such as these endanger life threaten property and wildlife and destroy our beautiful landscape
9127790 i am pleased that the number of fires is lower than its high point in 2003 but still concerned that more blazes of this kind have been recorded compared to the start of the decade
9127791 people young and old need to be fully aware of the consequences of their actions no matter how unintentional
9127792 i dont think theres any defence for sport shooters anymore its a hobby that creates danger to others
9127793 this tactic is being tried in other places as in the yuppie areas of bc for example
9127794 the task force will be in a staging location near the event site for a quick response should a disaster situation arise
9127795 the team will remain ready to respond at a moments notice however the team will use this time to conduct training exercises utilizing the national response plan global positioning systems and a myriad of other tools
9127796 wrack is mother natures recycling program which weve now contaminated with all our trash
9127797 its unsightly thats obvious but it contains objects that dont belong there the debris poses an entanglement hazard and other dangers to wildlife and marine animals
9127798 this illustrates all the trash that we have out there in the water and why we need to stop doing it
9127799 we are going to have a lot of officers on the river
9127800 our main focus is to ensure safety and part of that effort includes looking for boating under the influence violations
9127801 i understand theres fish and wildlife there so were going to keep those filled while we look into a new pump
9127802 we have planters there now but right now theyre looking pretty sad
9127803 well need three trees well need two trees on the north side and one on the south side of the parking lot
9127804 theyve identified a number of problems with certain palm trees
9127805 in the case of the terrace i would think it would be cheaper to move one of our trees than to purchase a new one
9127806 we need to let people know that its important to take care of those trees
9127807 weve had so many problems with folks sharing with us their illegally abandoned animals
9127808 its got a little bit of an aroma its not as beautiful as it should be
9127809 there was a chemical release in the immediate area of the structure which developed into a fire several minutes later
9127810 the fire was brought under control by emergency response personnel from the site and was extinguished at about 2 a m after operations employees completed the isolation of the operating equipment
9127811 this is a very sad day for the institute site family at this time we do not have a cause for the incident and cannot speculate as to what happened our utmost concern is for the safety of our employees and the community this incident will be thoroughly investigated the unit is totally shutdown it will not be restarted in the future until its safe operation can be completely assured
9127812 the important thing is that theres no way well restart that unit until its been fully investigated
9127813 as far as we can tell at this state no one has put their arms up and said this was wrong
9127814 i can confirm that our monitoring system did not detect anything
9127815 all of the sudden the sky lit up like it was the sun then you heard a boom and everybody took off
9127816 i didnt like the fate of my life in the hands of maybe its nothing
9127817 thats pretty rare to find them all together weve got a tooth from a shark more mosasaur bones fish bones at least two different species of fish plesiosaur bones as well as some bird bones
9127818 we could see the smoke as we were driving towards the site two large piles of manure and straw were well alight
9127819 we were there until 2 30am trying to put it out it took a long time because of the lack of water supply in the area
9127820 there was one hydrant close to the fire but there was not much pressure we had to ferry water from another hydrant
9127821 we were transporting one engine filling up the pump and bringing it back we will check the site to make sure the fire is out
9127822 like most law firms we churn through a shocking amount of paper
9127823 with paperless delivery everyone wins the clients the environment and the firm itself
9127824 why 10 000 ten thousand trees release enough oxygen back into the atmosphere to support 20 000 human beings for one year
9127825 its proof that you can be environmentally responsible and benefit your business at the same time
9127826 i wanna talk about me wanna talk about i wanna talk about number one on my me mind what i think what i like what i know what i want what i see

9127830 the announcement by kruger shows the power that an engaged marketplace and major customers have in bringing about better forest management in canada

9127835 are you new or something man that guys just feeding us the same old bullshit that they all do saying how hes gonna do this and do that and they dont ever do none of it like if hes elected president hes gonna cure cancer or turn sewer water into gasoline or something i cant believe you bought into that shit
9127836 no way man this guys different hes gonna be our first black president
9127837 so what are you talking about you dont think a black man can be president
9127838 yeah you did youre a racist man thats what you are
9127839 screw you man i didnt say anything about a black man cant be president youre the one talking about race
9127840 sure he can but that dont mean hes gonna be a good president just because hes black
9127841 yeah right whatever man i know who im voting for that old guy wants to start a nuclear war and throw poor people out in the street talking like its not the governments problem well then whos problem is it huh
9127842 since when did you start caring about politics you never even voted before
9127843 well this time its different i got to get involved you know the people have got to rise up and take action its our time you know hey i think i saw one of those things before
9127844 yeah over at my grandmas house she had one of those i cant remember what she used it for though i think she used to wrap fish in it or something
9127845 nah cmon thats old people stuff let me see it
9127846 you just read it are you serious how are you supposed to post comments or links or things like that
9127847 thats some messed up shit man you know what i like to do i like to read something then go down into the comments and post something like you suck or something like that man it pisses em off when you do stuff like that
9127848 yeah i care i follow the news but i dont read boring crap like this newspaper thingy i read about the things i care about you know
9127849 i dunno cool stuff you know like that guy who put a bic lighter in his microwave and the thing exploded and burned his house down did you read about that what a dumbshit
9127850 no i read about iraq and stuff like that how the governments sending people over there to die just so dick cheney and his oil friends can get rich i know whats going on
9127851 give me a break what do you think were really over there to fight terrorists when there werent even any terrorists over there till we arrived
9127852 no i mean if you pick and choose only the news that you want to read then how do you know that what youre reading is true if youre only interested in hearing the same old sermon then how do you know that the preacher isnt lying
9127853 i know when somethings bullshit or not ok just because i dont read newspapers that doesnt mean im stupid and besides i dont get all my news from the internet i watch tv and things like that
9127854 no it doesnt make you stupid it makes you narrow you said it yourself you dont even want to hear what the other guys gonna say
9127855 i already know what hes gonna say im not gonna waste my time watching that crap
9127856 did you see those may day parades they had in moscow
9127857 russias been making lots of money lately on account of all this oil and natural gas theyve got and you know what theyve been doing with that money theyve been rearming that parade was pretty impressive tanks missile launchers troops all kinds of stuff when i was watching that speech for some reason i just started to think about that
9127858 so youre saying if obama gets elected then the russians are going to come over here and kick our ass thats a bunch of bull
9127859 no im saying that everybody is saying that obama is the next jfk so ok jfk was young and inexperienced and when he was elected a lot of people around the world percieved him as being weak thats a big reason why khruschev built those missile bases in cuba the russians wanted to test jfk and they were pretty sure that if push came to shove he would back down he didnt of course but you gotta think the russians are looking at obama and wondering what hed do in the same situation i mean you dont build a huge military machine just to look pretty in the may day parade
9127860 what the hell are you talking about who the hell is khruschev
9127861 im not saying it would be one way or the other i just think it would be ironic that if confronted by the russians maybe this time it would be the u s that would back down maybe pull our missles out of poland or something like that itll probably never happen but i dont know
9127862 yeah well maybe if that old guy gets elected then hell back down too
9127863 no i dont think so i mean his wifes over in georgia right now sure its all for humanitarian purposes but its also pretty in your face the russians know how mccain would react i guess thats why western europe is so gung ho for obama the last thing they want is a confrontation with the east or another cold war
9127864 a what war so what if obama backs down were better off making friends than enemies no more of this iraq shit or maybe you think we should just blow each other up
9127865 yeah right i cant believe people actually used to read these things what a dumb idea why waste a bunch of trees when you can just post it online
9127866 these things wont be around much longer anyways so i wouldnt worry about it pretty soon theyll be in museums in little glass cases with signs next to them explaning to people what they were kind of sad really
9127867 kind of dumb if you ask me it not even web 1 0 no video no audio no comments what can you get from one of these that you cant get online
9127868 i gotta go weve got a couple of the vcs coming in after lunch and ive got to show em how wisely were using all that seed money they gave us its a pain but theyre pretty cool about it ill see you later
9127869 no thanks ah hell why not i was thinking about swinging by the fish market after work anyway it might come in handy
9127870 i got to be going too shoot me an email and let me know how the meeting went
9127871 will do and try not to worry too much about the russians invading poland or something ok
9127872 and dont go sticking your lighter in the microwave see ya
9127873 the standard amp poors case shiller u s national home price index released tuesday showed home prices dropped a record 15 4 percent during the second quarter however the rate of single family home price declines slowed from may to june a possible silver lining
9127874 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year
9127875 overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us

9127894 on aug 11 i took stalins personal effects in a taxi to the state museum in tbilisi for safe keeping i called the taxi and paid for it myself these are things that you simply cannot replace
9127895 nothing was touched in the stalin museum even though it would have been quite possible to come in through the open windows
9127896 of course the russian soldiers were also here they wanted to visit the museum but we insisted that it was closed and we did not let them visit
9127897 of course we are proud of stalin he was a man of such talent and qualities we need leaders like stalin today he had authority
9127898 compare him with todays leaders like us president george w bush or georgian president mikheil saakashvili
9127899 why did the russians do this to gori it was here that stalin was born without him moscow could not have won the war
9127900 if a person works in a memorial museum and does not respect the person who is being remembered then they should not be working here
9127901 stalin was a great phenomenon he was born in that tiny hovel and then rose up he was a great strategist he won world war 2
9127902 i do not believe the lies about stalin leading the repression no one knows what the reality was
9127903 we just know one thing that without stalin the world would have been in the hands of hitler these are the facts
9127904 china has two objectives in the pacific one is diplomatic recognition and keeping taiwan out of the picture the other is to have access to natural resources particularly fisheries
9127905 we will decide what is in our national interest if we have to we will seek assistance from outside the pacific forum and the commonwealth
9127906 we are pleased the commonwealth has recognized fijis potential as a regional hub for the international office
9127907 we will do everything possible to facilitate these headquarters in suva
9127908 china must have been painfully aware that taiwan would be the commodores next port of call
9127909 it would be easy for all regional donors to curry favor with the interim regime in fiji but that would have serious negative consequences for the region and its stability let alone fiji
9127910 it will be as when a man who was going on a journey called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them to one he gave five talents to another two to a third one to each according to his ability then he went away immediately the one who received five talents went and traded with them and made another five likewise the one who received two made another two but the man who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground and buried his masters money the one who had received five talents came forward bringing the additional five he said master you gave me five talents see i have made five more his master said to him well done my good and faithful servant since you were faithful in small matters i will give you great responsibilities come share your masters joy then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said master i knew you were a demanding person harvesting where you did not plant and gathering where you did not scatter so out of fear i went off and buried your talent in the ground here it is back his master said to him in reply you wicked lazy servant so you knew that i harvest where i did not plant and gather where i did not scatter should you not then have put my money in the bank so that i could have got it back with interest on my return now then take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten for to everyone who has more will be given and he will grow rich but from the one who has not even what he has will be taken away and throw this useless servant into the darkness outside where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth
9127911 why did you do that did the priest tell you to be romantic
9127912 he was destined to go to jerusalem to suffer grievously and be put to death
9127913 if you want to be my follower you must carry your own cross
9127914 you are the messiah the son of the living god
9127915 heaven forbids lord this must never happen to you the messiah
9127916 get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to my path
9127917 you are not judging by gods standards but by mans
9127918 but satan whispered it looks very beautiful from the back too
9127919 god grant me the courage to change the things i can change the serenity to accept the things i cannot change and the wisdom to know the difference between the two

9127925 there is no doubt that greater transparency will reveal some schools in australia may be seriously under performing and have been struggling for some time
9127926 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you
9127927 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9127928 sabah mp wants all faiths to be taught in schools
9127929 perhaps one of the reasons for delinquency in youths is the lack of religious classes in schools
9127930 there is a conspiracy of silence and a determination to avoid making public any information which might indicate that one school is more effective than another
9127931 voting for howard but electing costello was a big ask that many voters found unsettling
9127932 in proportion as the bourgeoisie i e capital is developed in the same proportion is the proletariat the modern working class developed a class of laborers who live only so long as they find work and who find work only so long as their labor increases capital these laborers who must sell themselves piecemeal are a commodity like every other article of commerce and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition to all the fluctuations of the market
9127933 the cost of production of a workman is restricted almost entirely to the means of subsistence that he requires for maintenance but the price of a commodity and therefore also of labor is equal to its cost of production in proportion therefore as the repulsiveness of the work increases the wage decreases
9127934 depleting a big fortune by all consumption and no regeneration
9127935 i am not chinese i am not indian i am not malay altogether we are malaysians

9127939 never be unduly elated by victory or depressed by defeat
9127940 change we can believe in yes we can we are the ones weve been waiting for
9127941 an incumbent african american legislator with a 90 per cent district may feel good about his re election chances but we as a community would probably be better off if we had two african american legislators with 60 per cent each
9127942 i have had a great life and this is the story so far

9127948 i was doing my own ironing when the phone rang
9127949 maribet make me a cup of coffee with no cream
9127950 your wife forgot to buy cream sir ill get you a cup of coffee with no milk
9127951 whats the difference between a domestic helper and a nun
9127952 did you hear about the domestic helper in saudi arabia who died and went straight to hell
9127953 it took her two weeks to realize that she wasnt at work any more
9127954 id be successful if it werent for fill in the blank
9127955 id have money if only the government would fill in the blank
9127956 i dont know how they got out of debt someone must have given them a bunch of money
9127957 everything in life changes including our camera specs and delivery dates
9127958 this solidifies us as a school and really puts us on the map and gives us an opportunity to really now grow the school
9127959 a lot of these kids really do go into church work
9127960 i spent a day out there talking to the teachers and talking to the students even though they dont have any facilities or anything out there these kids are really committed to their education
9127961 you can put me down as shocked and surprised and like ok why
9127962 he thinks somebody like me who is a clinton delegate is going to say oh goody a woman he doesnt understand who we are
9127963 just because she palin is a woman doesnt mean shes a candidate for us
9127964 a small percentage of hillary supporters might be engaged in supporting the woman just because she is a woman
9127965 but overall people who supported hillary because of her ideals supported her because they were democratic ideals not because she is a woman in that respect its not going to change the framework of the election
9127966 we had geraldine ferraro as our vice presidential pick in 1984 at least she was a congresswoman and everyone knew who she was
9127967 it is history and i congratulate sen mccain for choosing a woman
9127968 all i can say is they must be really really worried about barack obamas appeal a lot of the women were in favor of hillary clinton because of her stance on issues that are important to women
9127969 im very proud to be an elected official whos a woman but just having ovaries doesnt qualify you for anything
9127970 he is balancing his ticket and that is a smart thing
9127971 its going to be good for the republicans and not so good for us
9127972 i have to give him at least two points for that
9127973 always had a creative idea always trying to get people to use their own creative energies to solve problems and create things that no one else had created
9127974 she would harvest those and take them home and mix the dye and dye the wool and bring it back to the institute
9127975 she had a very creative approach to teaching the children and she wasnt afraid to get her hands dirty
9127976 i was never able to do that and i tried for years
9127977 and besides that she was a kick in the head i really enjoyed her because of her creativity she had a little bit different slant on life
9127978 my main background is in engineering but ive always had a love for the arts
9127979 maurers creativity flowed at institute of texan cultures church home
9127980 if the judge really had information about a murder im sure he would come forward with it
9127981 id be happy to present the case to a grand jury
9127982 as of friday morning 225 buses have come to the port from across the state
9127983 this is the third time this year weve gone though this so should we be called for were ready to go
9127984 we will continue to ramp up our efforts as conditions dictate so we will be ready regardless of what mother nature sends our way
9127985 our job is to control gustav and not let gustav control us
9127986 this is a very dangerous storm make no doubt about it we fully expect a category 3 or 4 hurricane
9127987 surprisingly we are just wide open for this labor day
9127988 s a is at the eye of the storm in safety preparations
9127989 we took it to where they do autopsies and now theyre saying theyre not even sure if its a man or a woman
9127990 ive been a sheriff well in my 24th year now and theres been maybe two or three other times i can remember weve had a part of a body but usually theres some kind of explanation we find the rest of the body
9127991 severed arm found in rural canal produces a mystery in willacy
9127992 should gustav pass over or just to the left of this eddy we can expect the storm to significantly intensify
9127993 right now we have 170 buses prepared to leave for the coast and were expecting up to 1 000 more
9127994 five ambulances a support truck and disaster supply trailer are en route to san antonio along with nine individuals from our fergus falls and pelican rapids minn staff and three each are from our jamestown and lisbon staff in north dakota
9127995 weve been building our response capacity since our response to hurricane rita
9127996 it already looked all smashed up then i saw the cop car
9127997 it looked like they were flushing out his eyes with something
9127998 he actually went to an individual who was selling a 1990 chevy van just outside seguin
9127999 he stopped and talked to the owner took it for a test drive and didnt come back
9128000 he kind of boasted about himself owning oil fields in orange grove
9128001 he said he worked for exxon and it was a company van and he was buying a car for his daughter and that he usually pays cash
9128002 in my opinion he picked it because a vehicle like this would not be a high priority for the police and it would blend in
9128003 one of the workers who works for the owner of the van from seguin said he was sure he saw moses driving around in a vehicle with dealer plates in seguin but it was not the vehicle he took from here
9128004 car shopping trips apparently based on a no return policy
9128005 as we were coming home i told robert well i guess youre a retired driver now
9128006 and he said im not retired im just at the bottom of the list again
9128007 whatever we had we always tried to make it go faster
9128008 when the car doesnt run good we still have poker and vodka to have a good time
9128009 they can arrest detain or do whatever is necessary to ensure law and order
9128010 there have been many lessons learned with katrina and hurricane rita and we are certainly implementing all those lessons in our emergency response plan
9128011 people are just working furiously to make sure everything is in place
9128012 those are my children leaving we try to keep them safe we see a lot more of them than their own family members
9128013 it is safer to have every single citizen leave and the city has a plan to help those who need transportation
9128014 i used to cry digging i just run out of tears
9128015 das ist die gr te heroinmenge die wir in den letzten jahren in salzgitter sichergestellt haben
9128016 at the heart of the wellington political process for close to 30 years
9128017 it remains to be determined whether gene transfer into a deaf mouse will lead to the production of healthy cells that enable hearing however we have made an important step toward defining an approach that may lead to therapeutic intervention for hearing loss
9128018 building this clinic represents an important expansion in abbottscommitment to improving access to care for children in the developing worldduring the last decade
9128019 it fulfills a critical need in tanzania where we have beenimproving health systems not only for people with hiv but also for thosewith other chronic health issues as well
9128020 i love my job but i dont like my boss
9128021 man i cant believe we dont have batteries in any camera this is such good blog fodder
9128022 what we found was that although inflammatory cells and other biomarkers of inflammation were increased there was no significant interaction demonstrated between obesity and asthma
9128023 this does not change the fact that there is a well established link between asthma and obesity sometimes a negative result is important and the results add to our body of knowledge regarding the obesity asthma link now we need to look in other directions for the answers
9128024 we did not look at this in our patients given that asthma is immunologically driven this is a potential avenue for further research
9128025 alternatively it may be that dynamic changes in lung function that occur with episodes of asthma are different with excess body weight
9128026 obese patients with asthma are more difficult to treat because their response to bronchoconstriction is exaggerated and gives the impression that the asthma is worse
9128027 they may well have worse symptoms but not as a result of underlying airway inflammation still the typical response is often to increase their inhaled anti inflammatory therapy this is unlikely to provide the answer and may even do harm the answer lies in dealing with the obesity itself
9128028 on the third anniversary of hurricane katrina we must renew ourcommitment to preparing for any disaster or emergency that puts americansat risk
9128029 while someprogress has been made we have a long way to go with the current state ofour preparedness lets hope the next storm does not test our nationsdefenses to the extent katrina did only three years ago
9128030 the survey reveals there are some big unheard messages these kind of data help us to quantify the differences between countries and to highlight where additional efforts are needed some of these countries have rarely had any population survey data to help their programme planning efforts
9128031 we know that people need to be given a reason why they should change they need to be shown how to change they need to be given resources or support to change they need to remember to change and they need positive reinforcement for changing many of these principles can be applied in designing education programmes to encourage and support behaviour change
9128032 this new finding may help to explain why the clock is so far reaching in its effects on the organism
9128033 we found that some 25 percent of the genes in our model organism appear to be under clock control i wasnt suspecting anything remotely like that
9128034 it appears the clock influences a number of biological processes including cell cycling protein metabolism and varied signaling processes
9128035 but perhaps the most important role weve seen so far is the clocks role in ribosome biogenesis
9128036 the resulting molecular mechanism or genetic network for the clock identified by this mode guided discovery process will have a broad appeal to geneticists physiologists and those with an interest in signaling pathways
9128037 the methods used to characterize what makes a biological clock tick will have numerous applications in finding genetic networks describing other complex traits in many biological systems
9128038 indiana data show that even brief interventions by our doctors dentists nurses and assistants can increase the number of hoosiers who tryto quit
9128039 these newguidelines provide a blueprint for clinicians and health care systems describing how smokers can access effective treatments how clinicians canprovide such treatments quickly and effectively and how health caresystems can support both smokers and clinicians in smoking cessationefforts were pleased to award a grant to clarian health to beginimplementing these practices
9128040 nicotine addiction oftenrequires repeated intervention and multiple attempts to quit which is whysupport from health care providers is essential
9128041 now that we have an accurate way to count these cells we are able to confirm what we long suspected that blacks might have a bigger army of hla specific b cells
9128042 if the recipient is not sensitized b cells represent only a patients potential for making antibodies
9128043 however about a third of patients in need of a kidney are sensitized since theyre often on their second or third transplantation and may have undergone transfusions
9128044 knowing that blacks have an increased number of hla specific b cells which increases their opportunity for antibody mediated rejection we may be able to customize treatments for black recipients to account for these differences and lessen the likelihood that the organ will be rejected
9128045 stater bros charities was pleased to sign on as the presentingsponsor of this years radiothon benefiting the loma linda universitychildrens hospital
9128046 with the economy struggling right now we were proud to beable to step in and fill the gap to help our community children achieve abrighter and healthier future
9128047 he could have divorced her but to kill her is a bit strange
9128048 come up with a plan on how to murder someone
9128049 either cut off the eyelids of the victim or cut out his heart
9128050 im not even sure if i would have gone through with it
9128051 if at all possible it would only be a complete stranger
9128052 hes going to have to bang a little bit to get in at me and hopefully ill be able to wake up by then
9128053 the evidence i received he busskohl discussed very openly these things with the police
9128054 within eight to 10 hours the bizarre type of thinking he was undergoing was gone
9128055 if anybody were to meet him and talk to him at this point he represents no threat to anyone
9128056 we see behavior that is very scary and yet were limited by the law as to how we can respond to it
9128057 we dont have preventative detention in this country where we think somebodys going to commit a crime and so then were able to lock them up
9128058 hes in a facility being examined by a very very good psychologist to determine what his mental state is
9128059 hes one of the most beautiful skaters ive ever seen i hate to use the word beautiful in hockey but
9128060 i am getting close to popping the question and ive been racking my brain for an idea for a cool and unique wedding band ive been thinking of contacting a
9128061 i said it like this can i grab one of those pillows
9128062 this man is insane who invites total strangers into their house to take a look around
9128063 i will set a hard cap on all carbon emissions at a level that scientists say is necessary to curb global warming an 80 percent reduction by 2050
9128064 in colonial days when the only fuel we burned was wood
9128065 south asia in action preventing and responding to child trafficking
9128066 the vast majority of children in centres dont need to be there
9128067 they have family the first priority therefore should be to reunite 80 per cent of the children in institutions with their families not to re open intercountry adoption
9128068 this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood hes not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis
9128069 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim
9128070 obama may not want to be counted as a muslim but muslims are eager to count him as one of their own
9128071 he has to be good for arabs because he is a muslim
9128072 he cant be a christian his middle name is hussein
9128073 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
9128074 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations
9128075 exploit his background to argue that an apostate is leading the global war on terror to galvanize sympathizers into action
9128076 i hear the whispered words within your masterpiece beautiful but here you can speak the unspeakable my friend i love you and i wanna be there for you and be someone you can come to my love runs deeper than my bones and you youre beautiful dont you know
9128077 it was 11 a m time for lunch the hallway began clearing out ms yue brought out a wheelchair
9128078 the only sanction that would really hurt russia would be if europe were to stop buying its gas but the eu cannot afford to do this even in theory because it would collapse before russia even noticed the difference independence on russian raw materials is a mortal sin the eu has never been able to agree on a common energy policy one could exclude russia from the g8 group of states it doesnt belong there anyway it was only allowed to join as a gesture to mikhail gorbachev boycotting the sochi olympic games would only be a moral gesture so what can be done a ban on imports of russian caviar rubbish the west has no alternative but to act rationally and try and save what can be saved both georgian provinces have been lost the main priority now is to save ukraine from a similar fate
9128079 almost half of the first division is in the bucharest trio steaua dinamo and rapid plus four from the provinces two romanian clubs are playing for the first time in the most important european club championship the champions league steaua bucharest and cfr cluj this is truly amazing because five or six years ago we would never have dreamed that even one team would play in the champions league football greats like holland russia turkey greece and scotland are doing less well that must mean something now the main thing is that we do not behave like the poor relatives from the provinces steaua must do better than last year when bucharest scored only one point and newcomer cfr cluj should take care not to go wild at the festival
9128080 deseaba componer m sica que tuviese ra z rockera no s lo canciones que siguiesen el modelo tradicional de verso coro y final pretend a un sonido mucho m s hipn tico y desde esta perspectiva poco tiene que ver con nuestro rollo t pico
9128081 we already know he is a rock star we already know he can bring 85 000 people together in a stadium he has done it multiple times he needs to talk to people who havent made up their minds yet
9128082 its likely that the campaign would do it differently if it had to do it again because the decision was made before the european trip
9128083 i wonder if this means they found two homeless dudes and one of their racquetball buddies and thats who some democrats are
9128084 your muslim isnt gonna be the president i will bet you a hundred dollars old man you cant afford to take that bet
9128085 im not afraid no im not mommy i am not scared of the dark
9128086 esta ma ana ten a que comenzar a trabajar y no s ni cu ndo voy a llegar
9128087 est bamos durmiendo y nos hemos despertado aqu luego la polic a se llev a los dos conductores
9128088 me dicen que en unas dos horas vendr otro autocar
9128089 llevaban m s de 32 horas conduciendo con s lo una hora y media de descanso y el permiso de transporte internacional era vigente desde el jueves y el viaje comenz el mi rcoles
9128090 ahora tengo lo que quer a hago lo que me apasiona y encima la gente disfruta con ello soy un privilegiado aparte de ganar cosas aqu no pido m s nada
9128091 el a o pasado termin el 26 y fue el mejor de mi carrera y ste creo que aunque no jugara m s partidos acabar a entre el 15 y el 18 vale la pena hacer un esfuerzo lo que queda de este final de temporada para tratar de terminar lo m s arriba posible y si es posible en shanghai
9128092 i find it very disturbing when politicians start trying to mould autonomous institutions to fit their own ideas just as i was against the institute compiling an official list of former agents i am also opposed to the idea of the victim list being passed by government decree the ipn should write the history but leave the public to draw its own conclusions in future someone who has different views to those of ipn president janusz kurtyka could take his place but this should be done in a civilised manner and only when his term of office has come to an end
9128093 it was the first country to call for military intervention in czechoslovakia and the last one to apologise for the crushing of prague spring after the fall of communism that is our 1968 and we should not forget it much less disavow it because it determines the transition in bulgaria and what we are now we should think of this 1968 every time we are shocked by a supposed dissidents collaboration with the secret police or when we marvel at our societys tolerance in the face of corruption abuse of power and political manipulation it is the mark which separates the east from the west both culturally and economically and renders equalisation impossible because prague spring marked out a geography according to which we are still in the east
9128094 apart from referendums the elections to the european parliament are the sole means for the citizens of the union to directly express their opinions on questions regarding europe certainly the elections are often dominated by national problems but they offer political parties a platform for a broad debate on the state of europe in france as elsewhere preparations for the elections in june 2009 have already begun in 2009 the new commission president will also be named why not use this twin event to make up for the european unions democratic deficit coupling the parliamentary elections with the battle for the commission offers a double advantage it would make the procedure more transparent and the nomination of a president would no longer be choosing a person but a policy
9128095 a conversation that lasts a minute and two seconds can be rounded up to two minutes driving up the bill the commissions indignation at this practice is justified such behaviour is not just inappropriate it borders on theft naturally the commission wants to take new steps to protect customers so it has called on all states to oblige telecommunications companies to charge by the second an excellent idea although it is a shame that it is necessary to pass laws to make companies act reasonably but a sector that treats its customers like this has only itself to blame
9128096 in principle or on paper everybody is in favour of territorial integrity and against separatism the russian federation also espouses these principles due to its own problematic regions like chechnya but when it suits its interests moscow carefully defends the same criteria for others like on the kosovo issue or for cyprus moscow has long supported the greek cypriot administration over the cyprus issue objected to turks establishing a separate entity and refused to recognize the turkish republic of northern cyprus trnc but russias operation in south ossetia and its active support for separatism both there and in abkhazia shows that when its own interests are at stake it takes the opposite side moscows recognizing separatist regions over georgias territorial integrity is a bad example for the greek cypriots who have always gotten sympathy and support from russia
9128097 it is true that russia supported us in the cyprus conflict it is no accident that the republic of cyprus sees moscow as a stable ally because moscows view of the cyprus problem is based on international law appealing to international law is the strongest weapon we have for that reason we must be very careful how we interpret the crisis between russia and georgia the republic of cyprus will soon have to make an official statement on this topic this position must not vary from the one we have had for years that means we must unconditionally call for the respect and protection of the territorial sovereignty of states the position we adopted for kosovo must also apply to georgia otherwise we will only undermine our own position
9128098 turkey has fallen between two stools as regards the caucasus crisis while the us and many european states have condemned russias recognition of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia ankara confined itself to a statement by its foreign ministry expressing turkeys concern about the recent developments that was a minimum rather than a maximum of diplomatic criticism if turkey condemns moscows recognition of the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia ankara risks being told by moscow that it has done the same thing in cyprus turkey could even be tempted to follow russias example in cyprus the game with the two conflicting principles the right of self determination of minorities including those in kosovo and on cyprus and territorial integrity in all other cases is an extremely awkward issue
9128099 the athletic gordon brown should take inspiration from the gold medals won at the olympic games in china the scotsman does not lack determination but he has less tactical skill for the grandiose achievements of the team britain were the only bright spot for the british this summer by contrast the countrys economic performance is on a downwards slide of course the british economy is not the only one in europe to be sinking into recession but this is small consolation for our island neighbours who have enjoyed 16 years of uninterrupted prosperity let us hope that olympic champion in track cycling chris hoy can give gordon brown a few tips otherwise the latter could become the eliminated scot
9128100 if anti fascism is stated in the constitution of the new croatian state if the law prohibits the inciting of national religious and racial hatred then whats the problem the problem is the croatian attitude to its own past documents and declarations are one thing but reality is another before its 17 years of independence croatia was an independent state only once between 1941 and 1945 when it was ruled by a nazi puppet government croatian politicians especially prime minister ivo sanader loudly promote european values and declare their commitment to join the eu while such un european behaviour as war crimes terrorism and fascism might be legally banned they are in practice tolerated and even nourished does the eu need this croatia a country that is showing the world only its pretty summer face but keeping its dubious values hidden
9128101 the name lufthansa must bring back unpleasant memories for the luxembourger cargo airline after all it was the german airline that got the international air cargo rivals including cargolux into trouble with the competition authorities in europe and the us for coordinating their fuel surcharge prices the german company may have acted appropriately in its own interest but lufthansa did considerable damage to cargolux this relationship would have to be resolved in the negotiations
9128102 the result of the study will put die hard lovers of braised beef in a panic because even if all companies and methods bio or not were optimised to reduce their environmental impact the fact remains that the central way of making agriculture more climate compatible involves a drastic reduction in beef production the price of beef olives will then rise dramatically and anyone who believes that buying a rib steak from an health food shop will help climate protection has another thing coming this becomes obvious when you convert beef production to an equivalent number of kilometres driven in your car one kilo of bio fed meat generates the same emissions as driving 113 4 kilometres in a compact car with conventional feed the equivalent is 70 6 kilometres because production is more intensive however politicians only call for what has long been compulsory not the slightest reduction in beef production
9128103 the printed book our cultures most important medium is menaced so far only one thing seems certain anyone who has anything to do with books be it writing printing binding publishing transporting selling or reading them will be affected in one way or another by the new technology it is not just the economics of the book market that will change an unprecedented upheaval is threatening to radically alter the long standing profanation of the written word the cult of the book has its oldest and deepest roots in religion the process of enlightenment and secularisation has not destroyed this cult but simply given it new roots anyone who picks up amazons e book reader cannot fail to be impressed in the first hours and days by the technical possibilities offered by the device then when he goes back to his bookshelf the aura of the book appears to him as tender and vulnerable as the wings of a butterfly
9128104 but she has 5 children and that must count for something
9128105 there was only one creation one single event when life was born
9128106 scientists have identified a mutant form of a gene or allele that prohibits the growth of armour
9128107 by documenting the physical traits and genetic makeup of the offspring produced by these marine sticklebacks in freshwater we were able to track how natural selection operates on this gene
9128108 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
9128109 it leads us to believe that the genetic expression is also tied to increased growth rate
9128110 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
9128111 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
9128112 see how can evolution be a fact how can you strengthen a fact
9128113 if the fish arent expending resources growing bones which may be significantly more difficult in freshwater due to its lack of ions they can devote more energy to increasing biomass
9128114 this in turn allows them to breed earlier and improves over winter survival rate
9128115 we found a significant increase in the frequency of this allele in their offspring evidence that natural selection favours reduced armour in freshwater
9128116 i will have a paycheck coming in and i can move
9128117 the easiest thing in the world is to spend other peoples money on other peoples projects and that is what we are about to do
9128118 for the homeless dollars that we have allocated this is how i want them spent to make sure that people have an opportunity to get employment
9128119 unless we were told we would have no way of knowing
9128120 we were made aware that martinez was a suspect in an ongoing criminal investigation
9128121 i did find out later that we had been notified by st petersburg police that rigoberto martinez was a suspect in a rape
9128122 and we cant arbitrarily hold people in jail because of our suspicions or our thoughts
9128123 hereby permanently enjoined and prohibited from effectuating or enforcing ordinance 2903
9128124 the new ordinance is yet another attempt to circumvent the courts prior rulings and further an agenda that runs afoul of the united states constitution
9128125 there is more tension here than in the middle east
9128126 im a big fan of emmerdale and im looking forward to appearing in such an established show
9128127 my character is a true aussie with some great lines its going to be a lot of fun
9128128 were delighted that mark was available to make this appearance
9128129 the path to true love has been anything but smooth for louise and jamie mark will bring some great comedy to this heartfelt episode
9128130 therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to a religious service it is impossible to be buried
9128131 there is a degree of black comedy about this and my mother who had a fantastic sense of humour would certainly have laughed
9128132 when i rang up and asked derry city councils cemeteries department if it was possible to bury an atheist in a municipal cemetery they said it was possible because there were different sections for catholics protestants and muslims
9128133 my wife asked if it meant they were going to start an atheist section and the woman said oh no she can go in with the protestants
9128134 therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to a religious service it is impossible to be buried
9128135 my wife asked if it meant they were going to start an atheist section and the woman said oh no she can go in with the protestants
9128136 i was much cheered upon my arrival in prison by the warden at the gate who had to take particulars about me he asked my religion and i replied agnostic he asked how to spell it and remarked with a sigh well there are many religions but i suppose they all worship the same god
9128137 therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to a religious service it is impossible to be buried
9128138 therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to an islamic service it is impossible to be buried
9128139 but here you have to be either a protestant atheist or a catholic atheist
9128140 donegal is a cold wet windswept place far from modern amenities i suspect the atheists are dying to get out of it
9128141 if evolution is true why dont we see it happening
9128142 wouldnt the optimal solution be to have great big horns that also function as penises or is there some limitation on the insectoid body pattern that would prevent this from ever happening
9128143 one of the lies regularly promulgated by creationist ideologues is that you cannot see evolution in action right now
9128144 the basic crap they will put forward is that you might be able to see micro evolution but not macro evolution
9128145 or maybe there really isnt any gradual path of tiny steps that could move the penis to the head area each providing an incrementally more advantageous configuration than the last
9128146 how is it that little children are so intelligent and men so stupid it must be education that does it
9128147 jupiter has been called the solar systems vacuum cleaner because of its immense gravity well and location near the inner solar system it receives the most frequent comet impacts of the solar systems planets
9128148 will crawley is one of bbc radio ulsters best interviewers
9128149 the navy does not condone the actions for which he has been accused and charged we take these things seriously
9128150 she stated that he told her to smile in some of the pictures
9128151 always talked about sex when he was home from deployment
9128152 he knew he was going to jail with what he had said
9128153 there will be about 60 trucks when its all said and done making it from point a to point b
9128154 no question about it it is a project that has to be looked at very carefully and to see this truck arrive here today is a real sign that were making progress
9128155 we ramped up early and got some things in here but this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9128156 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9128157 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9128158 everything down to that last stapler to that office set youll see some more trucks like this coming through and well have more equipment itll be everything from office furniture to computers to a lot of the equipment for basketball operations
9128159 seemed distant and did not think that her horses were in poor condition
9128160 someone who isnt afraid to shake up the status quo
9128161 this is a classic partnership where were leveraging mutual assets
9128162 young guys are still watching live action sports so we still have a big presence there but theyre also spending a lot of time gaming thats where guys are these days
9128163 gaming is part of the bridge to that next group of consumers theyre trying to tap into
9128164 at the same time its not so far away from their core consumers and their group of classic sports like golf and football
9128165 this is the first time anything of this scope has been done before
9128166 our goal is to create simple applications for the search areas with the biggest demand
9128167 we have the financial means to expand in this area both organically and through acquisitions
9128168 its not a random situation these two gentlemen were acquaintances
9128169 its not an accident that theyve had quite a bit of success
9128170 i have seen a little but but not too much yet
9128171 they run pretty basic stuff they blitz a lot bringing linebackers stuff like that
9128172 small schools come out like theyve got something to prove they always have
9128173 they have nothing to lose if they come play a big school all the big schools kind of have a bulls eye on their back they just come up and give it all they got
9128174 if you cannot multitask or communicate without being passive aggressive dont even bother replying
9128175 i can be a tad difficult to work for im loud pushy and while i used to think we paid well i am no longer sure
9128176 i made a commitment to stay in the job for at least a year
9128177 i met the oldest child but not the others which my mother said was crazy to accept the job without meeting all the kids so well see
9128178 if you are fundamentally unhappy with your life you will be more unhappy if you take this job so do us all a favor and get some treatment or move to the rockies but do not apply for employment with us
9128179 also if you suspect all wealthy women are frivolous we are not for you
9128180 i have all sorts of theories on how to stack my dishwasher and if you are judgmental about ritalin for adhd or think such things are caused by too much sugar again deal break city
9128181 i hope she likes it here i sent the ad to one of my old sitters and she said she felt it was pretty accurate which sort of stung a little bit
9128182 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9128183 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9128184 despite this sluggish u s economy the general demand picture is better than it was post 9 11
9128185 in addition you have this consistent response across the board of airlines raising fares and adding fees
9128186 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9128187 the reality is and i dont want to diminish this the industry is going to have to cover its costs
9128188 if there are fewer flights that wont bother me but if flights are really expensive i just wont go or ill go by myself instead of bringing my son and husband
9128189 and then youre good to go you dont have to worry about that
9128190 a very very small number of people would have purchased tickets for travel in september or thereafter before the flights were taken out of the fall schedule in may and june of this year
9128191 i think if oil prices continue to go down you will hear calls for relaxation of fuel surcharges but that doesnt mean they wont hike base airfares
9128192 i dont think most people in every aspect of their trip will notice a difference
9128193 if there is a silver lining it may be that as a result of fewer overall operations they may see better on time performance
9128194 there will be about 60 trucks when its all said and done making it from point a to point b
9128195 no question about it it is a project that has to be looked at very carefully and to see this truck arrive here today is a real sign that were making progress
9128196 we ramped up early and got some things in here but this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9128197 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9128198 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9128199 everything down to that last stapler to that office set youll see some more trucks like this coming through and well have more equipment itll be everything from office furniture to computers to a lot of the equipment for basketball operations
9128200 we definitely had our opportunities we just didnt finish innings off
9128201 we had one of the best young pitchers in the game on the mound and he had to fight through every inning they made life miserable for him
9128202 you play so many games they all run together i dont give it that much thought i go out and prepare the same way every day
9128203 i didnt even know we had won 10 in a row until the other day
9128204 well sit on this one for about 30 minutes see our families and come out and do it again tomorrow
9128205 i was suspicious that i had bought a counterfeit so i called my friend herb
9128206 i asked her why she could sell them for such a reduced price and she just said
9128207 i dont like the fact that she is profiting on selling counterfeit items
9128208 the first warning is the plaque on the front this one is pinned down and not sewn on that would be my first clue
9128209 also on a genuine prada bag there is a plaque that says prada made in italy
9128210 on the inside pocket there is a certificate of authenticity

9128212 we regret that this happened the fair is a wonderful environment we want to represent it correctly and follow all the laws of the state
9128213 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
9128214 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
9128215 obviously last fall he and his family displayed a great amount of generosity and unselfishness towards our basketball program
9128216 when a scholarship became available in may it was a no brainer to award it to taylor
9128217 we found that it was a very good deal compared to the best expectations you would have had with traditional negotiations
9128218 this is obviously one of our bigger loads and so were happy to have all of this equipment here so we can really get rolling
9128219 it really is taking that area that we had in the northwest and trying to make sure it fits here in this space and so far its been a pretty good fit
9128220 its been a little bit of a puzzle but its all worked out very nicely
9128221 i was expecting five sets i was there for four and five but he wasnt there anymore
9128222 he is the biggest player for sure nadal is playing good tennis this year but for me federer is the best one
9128223 i dont think its affected a whole lot of matches i dont know how many times its saved a match because thats what its there for really but at the big tournaments at the big courts usually you have the best linespeople as well
9128224 the worst linespeople are usually on the outside courts where you need it more thats the problem with the system
9128225 as long as im doing the splits that means im healthy
9128226 when im not doing the splits you know theres something wrong
9128227 im not too sure about my body if i go into a split who knows if ill come back up
9128228 i wish i didnt have any drama in my matches i wish i would win nice and in a simple way
9128229 who likes drama do you know anybody that likes to get involved into tight matches
9128230 its about taking those three things into consideration and making a choice
9128231 they have been checked by a navy paramedic and initial reports say that they are in fair condition and hospitalization will not be required
9128232 stranded on an 18 inch ledge unable to climb up or down
9128233 he roper did great things in our bowl game so im really excited to see if he can continue that kind of development
9128234 it helps us a little bit we know what to watch on film we know who to watch on film we can key his tendencies his releases and who his main receiver is
9128235 it helps us out hopefully it will work out on saturday
9128236 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9128237 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9128238 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9128239 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9128240 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer
9128241 we encourage them to study it calculate what it means to them and their families and vote in their best interests on sept 3 this is our best and final offer and thats what it means
9128242 were supposed to be a world class company but they dont want to give us a world class contract
9128243 boeing is rolling the dice on this theres no question about that
9128244 third quarter results were stronger than we expected principally due to strong performance from our european operations during the month of july
9128245 the lord bless you and keep you the lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious to you the lord lift up his countenance upon you and grant you peace this day and forevermore
9128246 in gods holy name i bless you and i send you with all my love and prayers may god guide and uphold you and may you be a blessing to others
9128247 we give thanks for lucy as lucy begins school tomorrow we ask that you surround her with your love give her an inquiring mind and a discerning heart may lucy be a blessing to her classmates teachers and to north school
9128248 children no matter how nurtured at home must be risked to the world
9128249 eternal god you call us to ventures of which we cannot see the ending by paths as yet untrodden through perils unknown give us faith to go out with courage not knowing where we go but only that your hand is leading us and your love supporting us
9128250 may god grant you grace never to sell yourself short grace to risk something big for something good and grace to remember that the world is now too dangerous for anything but truth and too small for anything but love
9128251 i dont know if hes going to be ready to pitch the next couple of days or not i hope he is and i hope he can get a little work in at tacoma too
9128252 people who are allergic to milk run the risk of a serious or life threatening reaction if they consume this product no illnesses have been reported for most consumers there is no safety issue with the product
9128253 there have been no reports of illness none at all
9128254 for those shoppers for whom we didnt have a number we will print the recall warning on their receipt when they shop next
9128255 coming to the knicks and hopefully being able to contribute means a lot to me
9128256 it has always been my dream to play for this team my goal is to show the coaches that i can play and do all that i can to help the team win some games
9128257 i am very happy my son will follow in my footsteps
9128258 hopefully he will have a long and productive career in new york i am proud of him and wish him nothing but success
9128259 patrick ewing will have an opportunity here to compete for a spot on our roster
9128260 he is a solid defensive player and a very good athlete
9128261 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9128262 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9128263 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9128264 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9128265 it was very disappointing not being able to move forward with an effective strategy
9128266 at some point in life you have to look and see if you can achieve your goals it was not a good plan
9128267 we are pleased mr schultz sees that it is neither in his nor seattles best interest to continue this litigation
9128268 the team has left for its new home in oklahoma city and its time to move on
9128269 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
9128270 by receiving an equitable share for our resources we are now in a position to demand more accountability and seize opportunities to save for future generations
9128271 dry storeroom no 1 the secret life of the natural history museum
9128272 hundreds if not thousands will fall through the cracks of an evacuation plan and they will be left in the city not out of choice but out of necessity
9128273 my thing is my fright is if we have somebody in these houses and theyre not able to get out theyre going to perish
9128274 if i was the governor of louisiana id give the evacuation order as soon as possible
9128275 we are recommending to reject the contract and to vote to strike
9128276 going around the union and trying to bargain directly with our members
9128277 wds was well aware that its filings were very late
9128278 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
9128279 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
9128280 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
9128281 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
9128282 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighborhood
9128283 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
9128284 youre going to want to look at streets with low traffic volume
9128285 i saw the yard and the garage and i said i have to buy this house
9128286 this is a hard job to do on a bike
9128287 you have to get the right people and the day has to be nice you have to be looking at property in the same couple mile location
9128288 if youre meeting someone on location youre not exactly business presentable when you show up dripping with sweat
9128289 if they dont want a sweaty realtor then maybe they want someone else
9128290 most people dont care the last clients i took out bought an 800 000 house they arent exactly poor people living off the earth
9128291 so i opened it up started reading it and it was a threat on my life they did say not to contact police to keep it hush hush dont even tell your family and friends because it could be one of them
9128292 i wouldnt rate it as a very credible or high risk situation certainly if you have any doubts contact local law enforcement
9128293 i just cant believe he would do anything like that
9128294 im going for maximum death and destruction in the work place
9128295 possessed many of the characteristics deemed to be risk factors for future acts of targeted violence
9128296 the pickup is now the length of a small economy car
9128297 the last of a line of lasts the pale princess of a palace cracked
9128298 not only have they always served victrola coffee but theyve also cultivated a loyal following of local customers
9128299 for people who think they need a gun in a public place they should have second thoughts
9128300 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful with this litigation
9128301 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9128302 we have received feedback that a continuing adversarial relationship with the nba was not politically useful to the citys ongoing efforts to secure a future franchise
9128303 thus the prevailing wisdom of many in the seattle community and the advice of key members of the bcos is that seattles best chance for a professional basketball franchise is to end this litigation and allow the city state legislature and other parties to begin the necessary fence mending with the nba
9128304 it was very disappointing not being able to move forward with an effective strategy
9128305 at some point in life you have to look and see if you can achieve your goals it was not a good plan
9128306 we are pleased mr schultz sees that it is neither in his nor seattles best interest to continue this litigation
9128307 the team has left for its new home in oklahoma city and its time to move on
9128308 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
9128309 these storms have a tendency to change and so i dont have a scheduling update for you now
9128310 the republicans cant seem to catch a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9128311 we will be a good team with a chance to be a great team
9128312 i told the 2003 team the same thing and the 2004 team and the 2005 team how we work how deliberate we become when we learn how we make changes we need to make by becoming very mindful each day will determine how good we become in november and december
9128313 can we become the expert time will tell this team has a chance
9128314 its in the interest of all parties to get this resolved soon
9128315 we are part of a disappointing history that has unfolded
9128316 i feel accountable for accepting their oklahoma buyers assurances at the time assurances i now know to be dishonest i regret that i accepted those assurances and am deeply sorry for the outcome
9128317 unfortunately showing that the bennett group lied is not enough to turn back the clock and return the sonics as a result i am withdrawing our lawsuit
9128318 we are pleased to now be able to move on we look forward to an exciting future of nba basketball in oklahoma city
9128319 allowing the nba to intervene negatively impacts our case increasing the complexity and framing the issues in the litigation on the terms of the bennett group and the nba
9128320 as a result of these developments our legal team and i no longer believe we can be successful in this litigation
9128321 all of a sudden it just dried up it was running good then it dried up and never came back
9128322 ive been spending the last month trying to prove its an emergency its hard on her health
9128323 i dont know theres so much b s going on i dont know whats happening
9128324 for everything there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up what is planted a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up a a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing a time to seek and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away a time to tear and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace he has made everything beautiful in its time
9128325 we will not hide them from their children but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord and his might and the wonders that he has done that the next generation might know them the children yet unborn and arise and tell them to their children so that they should set their hope in god and not forget the works of god
9128326 the law recognizes a difference between a true threat one that can be carried out and the reported racist rantings of a drug addict
9128327 a bunch of meth heads get together we dont know why they do what they do people do lots of stupid things on meth
9128328 he dont belong in political office blacks dont belong in political office he ought to be shot
9128329 yo just face it theyll never be dope again its just not possible you only get that magic once
9128330 i could have changed every single thing and nobody else cared
9128331 there was nobody telling me what to do i wanted to keep adult michaels mask and his look i thought that was sort of the iconic thing to me that was the exciting part if i was going to remake frankenstein i would want him to have a flat head and bolts in his neck because that to me is what frankenstein is then i was trying to think as a fan because i could have made it not haddenfield i didnt need to put dr loomis in the movie or laurie strode but then i thought well these are probably things people want to see done it would be kind of like remaking willy wonka without the oompa loompas you kind of want to see them so i tried to keep the things that i thought were fan iconic moments
9128332 this one was kind of funny because i didnt want to keep doing that what i did want to do what i thought would be funny is everybody was so sure that like in the original dr loomis would shoot michael and hed be dead and then he would disappear even when i was sitting with the audience you could tell they were like yeah i knew that was going to happen so when he crashes through the window the whole audience you could tell sat up and paid more attention it was like wait a minute this isnt the way its supposed to happen here i kind of could play off the first film and peoples expectations of what they thought was going to happen
9128333 everything seems to be overexplained all the time now i was kind of complaining about that in the sense that even with this movie its like i cant imagine anyone walking in not knowing anything about it because i feel like ive overexplained every tiny minute detail the way i wanted it to come across was that michael myers in this movie is not a product of his environment he has what i thought was kind of like a normal crappy life i thought it would be kind of clich if he had nice parents and a nice house like that but he was born bad is the way that i always played it there was no explanation for why he was like this every kid gets picked on in school nobodys life is perfect in researching kids that kill other kids which does happen there was no explanation it would be a normal kid
9128334 i have no problem with it i guess it seems a little weird but to me i wanted to get it out early enough im always afraid that if you put it out too close to halloween will people not care come november 1st its kind of like christmas movies are great until december 26th and then theyre like ugh
9128335 its not going to be a violent show at all
9128336 its light its fun it has some dark edges but its really fun there will be a lot of action in it but its not grotesque its a really warm sweet funny vampire show
9128337 cbs wanted to only do a small presentation so we went into this with our eyes wide open but we didnt know what we were doing at that time we were kind of figuring out where we were going when we got together and we decided that we wanted to do the show we all sat down and said what would we do if we were going to do it as a series we never really had a pilot per se so we had to kind of think about what that pilot would be it just came about that we had a wonderful group of players
9128338 thats just the magic of good producing it was really we had a script that we had created and cbs went through with us and we kind of went through some scenes they wanted us to shoot and we just titled it together with great narration that i was able to pull off and we made it feel as good as we could it felt good enough to get a nine oclock slot on tbs on friday night but it was just a good idea but the studio felt and the network felt at that time that we needed to kind of have more of a sense of what the show was the presentation was just like a presentation it wasnt really a full blown developed kind of piece of a show it was like 26 minutes of stuff put together with a kind of packing tissue i think it set up what we were doing and i think it showed off alex
9128339 linux is benefiting from growing support in the handset oem community most notably nokia with less traditional types of devices aimed at mobile broadband applications
9128340 we are providing our customers the choice to use multiple music sources
9128341 it thrilled my heart to see them pray to receive christ
9128342 wed been sitting there visiting all morning going through the tract and for the first time they saw the scripture in their own language we established a bond and now we are sisters in christ
9128343 we planned everything so that we could retire at 55 to do volunteer missions
9128344 we actually thought at first god wanted us to go as full time missionaries through the foreign mission board now international mission board but he showed us quickly that was not to be the case instead he was calling us to serve through short term missions
9128345 i am fully convinced that every person created by god should have the opportunity to hear the gospel and respond yes or no
9128346 in order to do that someone has to go and tell we are simply trying to be obedient to what the lord has called us to do
9128347 i confess that when i first saw mussa and the mama i did not think they were going to make it well
9128348 but they did and they were a testimony to the people one older man said he could not come to the gathering to hear the gospel preached and then he saw the mama walking from hut to hut sharing the gospel and he got up and went one day we all stopped for lunch but the mussa never came back to eat he kept sharing the gospel this is a great example to us
9128349 it has been awesome to be on this trip and to share this experience with them they have such a love for the lord and ive learned a lot just being with them papaw always has some word of wisdom hes sharing with me
9128350 i would say to retired people dont retire just move on to what god has called you to do next
9128351 if you are still living and breathing you are a missionary you dont have to go overseas to be a missionary but if you do god will provide the resources and if he calls go dont hesitate go do it
9128352 you shall not misuse the name of the lord your god for the lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name
9128353 do not be deceived god cannot be mocked a man reaps what he sows
9128354 but as for me and my household we will serve the lord
9128355 i must have forgotten my bill of rights at home
9128356 once i started reading up on the faith and reading the quran its amazing how similar the monotheistic religions really are islam judaism christianity they all come from the same root and from the same place the same small area of land
9128357 let me make one thing clear as a place to begin
9128358 in times of multimedia communication this is just not enough for the consumer
9128359 what would you do if you woke up one day and everything on your computer had reverted to its state
9128360 major props are due to barry zito after almost an entire season of being victimized by the unflattering cameras of the associated press hes decided to take charge and float a few good looking images to the public himself by becoming a fashion model
9128361 shaun livington was a basketball dream before his traumatic injury at least now hes not just damaged goods livingston while working his way back to respectability still makes people vaguely queasy like walking past a corner where you once got mugged thus hes had some trouble securing a roster spot for 2008 09 sure theres the calculated risk of his recovery but honestly dude just kind of seems haunted after that fateful spill like his soul slipped out of him and now hes part of the walking dead
9128362 im going to do what i need to do if it goes to the ground ill probably break his leg i mean no question i will break his leg if he gives it to me im going to break it
9128363 ive known roy all his life all he does is run from his problems but of all the mistakes ive seen him make the biggest one was ever leaving you i promise you ill never make that mistake
9128364 pride doesnt win football games hard work wins football games individuals dont win football games teams win football games
9128365 its a cool place to visit but it aint home
9128366 jesus gave us a brain and he gave us a heart thats all you need if you concentrate on what you dont have you forget about what you do have
9128367 that guys gone i mean im still me but that character that alter ego is backstage somewhere waiting to get on stage the director has a whole other perspective going on
9128368 but by me and ice cube teaming up we were able to fight it i didnt want to do a throwaway mindless movie with fart jokes just to make 6 year olds laugh i want to provide my children with some substance
9128369 he got off to such a great start i feel bad for him
9128370 he was a very steady guy but this happens unfortunately
9128371 i think he is reliable he made pretty good decisions in the kicking game he runs hard he does all the things weve said but he is a part of that group at running back that we are going to have to take a look at
9128372 ben is one of the leaders of the receivers he has helped us all i dont look at it like his injury helps me i look at it like we need to get those injured players back
9128373 something i dont have cant possible burn in a place that doesnt exist for a nonsensical period of time
9128374 the addition of acer provides one more sign of the growing momentum behind blu ray disc and more importantly is a significant advantage for consumers as it further expands the already broad options available to consumers in the personal computer space
9128375 treason of the blackest dye was yesterday discovered general arnold who commanded at west point was about to give the american cause a deadly wound if not fatal stab its discovery affords the most convincing proof that the liberties of america are the object of divine protection
9128376 a providential miracle at the last minute detected the treacherous scheme of traitor benedict arnold which would have delivered the american army including george washington himself into the hands of the enemy
9128377 backfired a nation born for religious tolerance no longer tolerates religion
9128378 terrible screechy ear splitting guitars and a jumble of sounds that i just didnt get
9128379 hilly was an integral part of the punk scene from 1974 until his death
9128380 he was always supportive of the genre and of bands like the ramones blondie talking heads and richard hell and voidoids and will hold a prominent place in music history in an era when disco was the mainstream hilly took a chance and gambled
9128381 it is part of the human condition that as we get older we find that things that we once valued
9128382 the idea is simple if phones are proxy for people as in highway traffic planning in many parts of the western world the congestion of phones will be proxy for congestion of people
9128383 as part of the administration we drove the project and provided support to airtel to put up the towers in extremely congested crossings
9128384 there are 700 new vehicles being added to bangalores choked roads everyday infrastructure cannot keep pace with it so there has to be some monitoring mechanism for btis mapunity provides the grey cells airtel is the facilitator and the traffic police is the user of the data with the information we can take traffic related decisions
9128385 cisco and postpath will finally break exchanges iron grasp on business e mail
9128386 i specifically asked if this was something i could do on my own
9128387 what would you do if you woke up one day and everything on your computer had reverted to its state
9128388 for you created my inmost being you knit me together in my mothers womb
9128389 she came in there shook my hand and went right into the booth she was smiling the whole time in an hour we had a song i sang it first and she sung over what i did in key and everything then did a whole nother song she was about her business
9128390 i came out the studio and across the street were people with cameras on top of the building and waiting for her to come outside
9128391 only ones that are not competing on this tour is me and yung joc
9128392 i dont really do no songs off my album i do 12 songs in 25 minutes and they all hits i come out to im sprung do bow wows outta my system kellys im a flirt hueys pop lock amp drop it plies shawty we run through it its continuous nonstop we stop maybe one time so i can drink some water
9128393 like when i did kiss kiss with chris brown he used the auto tune he asked my permission
9128394 you gotta sing in a key thats between off key and on key you have to sing a half of a note some people are like let me put this on my voice and itll sound good i think the only other person that could use it without my permission is r kelly
9128395 i dont want anybody to be the new t pain the new akon i want you to be somebody no one has heard
9128396 that was me when i got in the game i was the new vocoder guy
9128397 you gotta imagine i grew up with music around the time he was poppin
9128398 it sounded like his verse was an instrument then i heard zapp singer roger troutman on 2pacs california love it was a wrap for me i had been looking for that effect for a long time thats me now remember back in the days when it was just music and it wasnt vocals at all i was trying to make my vocals like an instrument cause i used to listen to straight instrumentals
9128399 the department of state is extremely sensitive to your concerns and we are cognisant of the human rights abuses modi has committed
9128400 we have thoroughly searched department records and located no current non immigrant visa applications for modi however should we receive an application we assure you it will be adjudicated in strict accordance with the immigration and naturalisation act
9128401 the current response from the state department has virtually made narendra modi a persona non grata to the us
9128402 you feel like a celebrity riding around on it this weekend
9128403 gets us out of the house gets us out on the road
9128404 tu pedes elegir a que facci n pertecener si a la tecnol gicamente avanzada de los estados federados o el camino del pu o y aprobar el salvaje camino del guerrero que pertenece a la confederaci n del este donde el poder da derecho
9128405 i think even obama would have to laugh at that one
9128406 i think youll see some of sen clintons supporters wondering why sen barack obama didnt pick her
9128407 and hes picking up the ball where the forest hills queens a clinton fan who said gender should never be the only consideration
9128408 i didnt vote for hillary because she was a woman i voted for her because i liked what she had to say
9128409 at the end of the day im voting for the man or woman who incorporates the democratic party ideals into their message and that seems to be barack obama
9128410 certainly she has less experience than other republican women who he could have chosen so that could actually have the effect of angering some women
9128411 people are looking for a historic campaign and i think this might do it
9128412 otegi est sorti 7h25 05h25 gmt et il y a beaucoup de personnes dehors
9128413 they say its 80 mph but it certainly seems to be over 100 mph and ive been through lots of storms
9128414 weve taken in all the balcony furniture all the pool furniture the marquees tied up what needs to be tied up cut down any coconuts
9128415 so weve got to figure out some way to convince people that whenever warnings go out its for their own good
9128416 we must stop them so we dont meet them in the streets of birmingham and atlanta
9128417 poor george he cant help it he was born with a silver foot in his mouth
9128418 yes it meant alot to me i used to be dyslexic
9128419 in the four films starring kate we are given dream sequences that invite us to imagine how we might fulfil her desires
9128420 i stood up to the lobbyists the big oil companies and the good old boy network
9128421 for showing such grace and determination in her campaign the women of america arent finished yet
9128422 the first middle aged non college woman should be democrats but they stayed home instead of turning out for al gore and john kerry they are all about the economy those women are not social conservatives nor are they pro gun they are definitely security conscious and so they may have an issue with someone who has two years experience being a heartbeat away from a 72 year old man thats asking a lot thats a big ask
9128423 experience should trump change they really wanted a more experienced person as president it was a bonus for these voters was that hillary was a woman because it made them proud of her and themselves but those women are social progressives i dont see them turning to mccain because of sarah palin
9128424 its the independent woman who has seen mccain as too old or too stodgy but who isnt ready to vote for obama
9128425 if one could look into protoplasm with an eye capable of infinite magnification
9128426 one might expect to see the radiogens spaced like stars as suns in infinite miniature
9128427 we are spending sleepless nights praying that peace will prevail
9128428 he is very loving and very hardworking and never had to be told what to do
9128429 even though he is very learned hes a very good listener and respects the opinions of others
9128430 the senior barack was a great friend of president kibaki and also with raila odinga so if barry becomes president of america he will be well placed to help find peace
9128431 too many politicians here have an egocentric mind and they just wont give in
9128432 providence in the near future will offer us the chance to enjoy the beatification and canonization of john paul ii
9128433 is a scholar so he wants to do things in a precise way
9128434 in all human undertakings there can be mistakes so we need divine confirmation
9128435 peoples driven by their divine nature intrinsically seek good virtue perfection and beauty
9128436 relying on our peoples we can take giant steps towards reform and pave the road for human perfection whether we like it or not justice peace and virtue will sooner or later prevail in the world with the will of almighty god
9128437 i think anybody would prefer to play the whole game
9128438 ive got to go back and look at the film i cant answer that right on the money i like where i see hes at right now i do hes a more mature person naturally all of us would be after a couple years but its hard to answer that question
9128439 we denken sneller dat een kind een stoornis heeft omdat we de lat almaar hoger leggen
9128440 een steeds grotere groep haalt daardoor de norm niet meer maar dat wil niet zeggen dat ze allemaal een stoornis hebben
9128441 ik zocht naar het beste om me te helpen washington dooreen te schudden
9128442 vandaag bevinden we ons opnieuw op een van die bepalende momenten in de geschiedenis een moment waarop onze natie in oorlog is en onze economie in zwaar weer is terechtgekomen de amerikaanse belofte is andermaal bedreigd
9128443 amerika wij zijn beter dan deze laatste acht jaren wij zijn een beter land dan dit vanavond zeg ik tegen de mensen van amerika aan de democraten de republikeinen en de onafhankelijken van over het hele land genoeg dit moment deze verkiezing is onze kans om de amerikaanse belofte levend te houden in de 21ste eeuw volgende week zal dezelfde partij die jullie twee termijnen van george w bush en dick cheney bracht vragen om een derde daarom zijn we hier omdat we te veel van dit land houden om de volgende vier jaar te laten lijken op de acht vorige op 4 november moeten we voor onszelf opkomen en zeggen acht is genoeg
9128444 ik vond het veel te moeilijk en dus hield ik het na een paar pogingen voor bekeken

9128456 everybody is having fun its a lot more fun around here where youre winning
9128457 i just remember that we have played good the last four games
9128458 some guys are getting healthy and were getting some guys back
9128459 some guys that have come back are getting into a rhythm a bit i know these guys are better than they have shown
9128460 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9128461 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history
9128462 and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9128463 what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9128464 i believe one of the causes of failure is a basic misunderstanding spouses have of each other
9128465 some of these behaviours result from the way in which men were socialised and what they perceive society expects of them
9128466 for example there was a time when i considered my spouse to be hard cold selfish inconsiderate and insensitive and i saw those behaviours as weapons being used against me
9128467 while i do not assume total blame for the failure of my marriage i acknowledge that my response to the perceived undesirable qualities in my husband did play a great role in its disintegration in retrospect i can fully appreciate the need my husband must have felt to find companionship elsewhere while i do not condone his action i open myself to understanding especially since i too felt the need to turn to someone else for consolation from the pain i felt in the marriage
9128468 i repented and prayed for forgiveness so many times but i could not sense gods forgiveness i tried so hard to find his presence and to find again all the fruit of the spirit which i had once fully enjoyed i sent emails to just about every christian ministry i could find on the internet just to get a word of assurance that i had not lost my salvation
9128469 i did not realise that certain behaviours in my marriage could be classified as unsubmissive you may be thinking at this point that i am one of those wives who bow to their husbands
9128470 i do not consider myself such but i must point out that god dealt very sternly with me concerning the matter of submission during the first year of separation
9128471 sometimes we think more highly of ourselves than we ought and if god does not bring us face to face with ourselves we stumble along thinking we are the best thing since creation and everything about us is the way it ought to be
9128472 after beholding myself spiritually i knew that i needed god to change some things about me and as he revealed them to me i presented them to him little by little he brought about and continues to bring about and continues to bring about change taking me from glory to glory
9128473 suicidal depression is like a spiritual and mental cancer which eats away at the very foundation of your faith and your being it shakes the foundation of the christian faith on which you stand and it bring you to the lowest depth that of questioning the existence of god because he does not show up at the time you want him to to relieve you of your suffering
9128474 weve all had experiences in which we feel god has turned his back and he is just not there
9128475 your worst most unimaginable most unbearable experience ever will end up being the very thing you thank him for most if you allow him to prove himself to you through the experience
9128476 weve been praying for a depression like fay to rejuvenate the lake and we finally get one that should have put water back on the lake and it didnt
9128477 we got a little bit of water but we didnt get nearly our share
9128478 a lot of them are so happy the lake is back
9128479 i wouldnt want to give people the misimpression the lake is close to normal
9128480 this lake isnt fed by any other means than stormwater
9128481 and if it doesnt get here its not ever going to come back
9128482 if every drop of water went into the lake that was supposed to
9128483 i wouldnt doubt that there are a lot of backstroms around
9128484 i think it will be a great resource for people who want to do art history in connecticut
9128485 in the second year well try to make a systematic effort to find the art
9128486 always made enough money to live on i never had to worry
9128487 im hoping the public will be able to add more information
9128488 initial investigation point it out to be a case of suicide
9128489 the police have requested for permission to conduct a viscera test on the deceased the police do not want to leave anything to chance and we are probing all angles
9128490 the time between discovery of the body and the time of death can also throw some light on the case the time gap is important and if was long then it is certainly questionable
9128491 nothing suspicious has emerged so far and suicide is the most strong line of investigation but the reason for that needs to be established
9128492 even the girls personal diary has not revealed anything much there is no concrete evidence to support that she was under depression
9128493 two years earlier insight employees their friends and family paid 3 million for 20 of the fast growing company

9128496 hey your pledge will make a big difference in the lives of my kids
9128497 as children as soon as we got old enough to read that was the first thing he did was take us to the library
9128498 we didnt have a car so he would take us walking or riding our bikes we could each get five books
9128499 the library gave him a way to go all over the world and not leave lenoir county
9128500 he told us his children that you could go to china go to africa with books where the words speak to you like youre there
9128501 i still look for books by writers who do that and i know i got that from my dad
9128502 it was very plain that he meant for them to have it
9128503 when i took it to the bank they said it could not be added in with other assets he meant for it to be for the library
9128504 it didnt surprise me in the least because he loved the library

9128506 for somebody in the community to recognize our service to the public i think thats just wonderful
9128507 for him to grow up the way he did during the depression with no money for anything no money for jobs people didnt have fridges or cars and you worked picking whatever you could to feed your family he really had to love something to leave that kind of money
9128508 there wasnt a lot of money left over for anything fancy but we took advantage of the library growing up

9128540 immediate action was taken by council staff to remove the debris and clean the glass pillar and ascertain that no damage was caused to the monument the matter has been reported to the psni
9128541 even though it may have been kids that did this there needs to be respect shown for the monument i heard there may have been tomato sauce smeared on it by a child while it was wrong it has been cleaned up people should leave it alone it is there to mark the tragic event that happened and people should have some respect throwing eggs or sauce or debris at it is mindless this is something that marks what happened in this town the town is going to move on but we have to remember what happened in the past and be respectful of those who died these people need to have a bit of sense and show respect
9128542 like any monument or piece of art work it can always be a target for vandals
9128543 it shows what sort of morons they are i dont object to anyone having fun but this is a memorial to people who lost their lives in a terror attack and i think some respect should have been shown by those who were at it it is moronic and certainly i would call for this to stop
9128544 certain parties may have made their deals at st andrews and at stormont to support the psni but the reality on the ground is that they arent acceptable to ordinary nationalists
9128545 eirigi is gathering more and more support among ordinary nationalists
9128546 certain political parties claim that theyre making the psni accountable by taking up places on the policing board but people on the ground will never accept them

9128548 i witnessed first hand when the psni came onto the tullygally and drumbeg estates and assaulted women and children
9128549 the resistance that followed was a symptom of the fact that people are not prepared to accept the british occupation in ireland in the shape of the psni ruc
9128550 we are not linked to any group were a purely political organisation
9128551 the only threat we pose is to the british occupation of ireland while that british occupation continues there will always be people willing to resist

9128578 we definitely dont have full batteries on those fiber architectures weve only worked on single electrodes so far but the idea is to try to make these fiber batteries that could be integrated into textiles and woven into lots of different shapes

9128608 it said to whom it may concern charles couldnt be at work because his daughter had to have a heart transplant
9128609 maybe he thought that he didnt make as much of his life as he should have or have as much material things as other successful people have
9128610 but one of the reasons he didnt have all that was because of what he did for other people in his life
9128611 he cared more about his grandkids than anything else in the world
9128612 mccain declared as the pair stood together for the first time at a boisterous rally in ohio just days before the opening of the partys national convention
9128613 im going to take our campaign to every part of our country and our message of reform to every voter of every background in every political party or no party at all
9128614 politics isnt just a game of competing interests and clashing parties
9128615 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9128616 governor palin is a proven reformer who is a wise steward of taxpayer dollars and champion for accountability in government
9128617 by selecting a working mother with a track record of getting things done senator mccain has once again demonstrated his commitment to reforming washington
9128618 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9128619 he sees sarah governor palin as the future of the party
9128620 these are people hed like to elevate in that regard reformers
9128621 id like to know more about her experience if something happened to him would she be qualified to step into the presidency

9128625 express their deep concern over the recent tensions surrounding the south ossetia question and call for the sides to peacefully resolve existing problems through dialogue
9128626 the sco statement is a great victory by russia which has so far been in a vacuum
9128627 they openly demonstrated their support for russia in its standoff with georgia
9128628 i hope it will serve as a serious signal to those who try to turn black into white and justify this aggression
9128629 china expresses concern over the latest developments in the situation in south ossetia and abkhazia
9128630 we are fully aware of the complicated history and reality of the issues of south ossetia and abkhazia and given our consistent position on such issues we hope the relevant countries properly resolve the issues through dialogue and consultation
9128631 i would very much like international opinion to move toward peace and understanding without constant announcements about the cold war
9128632 it was not what i would call an endorsement of russias recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia
9128633 i think the fact that you havent seen some countries come forth and recognize these two parts of georgias territory is a significant sign
9128634 clearly there is unhappiness at what russia did and most countries think that georgias territorial integrity must be upheld
9128635 i am sure that the united position of the sco member states will have international resonance

9128713 evidence from systematic reviews shows hypnosis and relaxation techniques are probably not of general benefit in stopping smoking or substance misuse or in treating hypertension
9128714 generally a total cessation of smoking is the goal of hypnotic intervention and results are likely to appear in sharply defined success or failure classifications rather than in categories that rate degrees of smoking reduction on the whole hypnosis rates higher in effectiveness than other single methods in comparable reports however the range is great 15 to 90 depending on the sample the length of follow up and other variables hypnosis combined with individual counselling or psychotherapy appears to be more effective than hypnosis alone multiple doctorpatient contacts employing hypnotic reinforcements on initial suggestions of abstinence are more effective than a single session however spiegel s success rate with a single treatment

9128728 ive got some momentum right now so ive just got to stay smart reyes is a dangerous opponent and i need to beat him before i can think about my next move
9128729 i want to fight the best and the toughest opponents
9128730 right now reyes is a tough opponent because hes motivated and has five wins in a row i know its important to keep my winning streak alive ive won eight straight i need to bring my best to nevada
9128731 ive won five in a row so i need to keep winning
9128732 this is a great experience to fight on national television ive studied demarco hes a very good fighter and sharp puncher if you stand in front of him
9128733 i dont plan on letting him control the fight by standing there in front of him ive been working on my range to combat his fast combinations
9128734 i wish the fight was right now because im ready to go
9128735 im the underdog but this is a big opportunity for me
9128736 were just excited to fight on showtime and we want to make the best of it we want to come ready and make a good showing
9128737 hes a guy who gets up at six oclock in the morning regardless of what time it is
9128738 i was not focused in 2007 and i let some important opportunities slip out of my hands i am hungry serious and committed and i have a new trainer abel sanchez is teaching me new things and helping me to improve on my boxing skills i feel comfortable training under his tutelage he is a classy guy who understands me well
9128739 i am thrilled to continue to be a part of the sycuan family and after serious discussions with scott woodworth and sean gibbons of sycuan i believe i will have the opportunity to fight margarito clottey or cotto
9128740 the greatest of fighters have suffered losses and have come back stronger than before i have a lot of experience and after seeing fighters like antonio margarito successfully come back to fight after a long layoff i strongly believe i am prepared to step back in the ring with the best and regain the belt
9128741 i know what it takes to become champion and i will surprise the skeptics as i did back in 2006
9128742 we are proud that baldomir is serious about fighting again and he is in the united states to seriously prepare for his next fight he has been the cinderella man and we continue to believe in him and his abilities
9128743 isnt there proof that obama is a muslim just the name obama how can that not bother you thats not the typical african american last name muslims go about in changing their names malcolm x did mis guided i am no you are the one that is mis guided there is proof that he is muslim and he quoted out of the bible last night i am offended two fold by this whats the first thing that came to your mind when you herd about obama idk about you but i thought he had a towel on his head and was not as black as me youre a nice guy and all but youre being fed a bunch of crap straight to your face and youre eating it all up
9128744 towel on his head and was not as black as me

9128774 i stand with obama it was a genuinely outstanding speech it was magnificent i saw cuomos speech i saw kennedy in 80 i even saw douglas macarthur i saw mlk this is the greatest convention speech and probably the most important because unlike cuomo and the others this was an acceptance speech this came out of the heart of america and he went right at the heart of america this wasnt a liberal speech at all this is a deeply deeply centrist speech it had wit it had humor and when he used the needle on mccain he stuck it into mccain and it was funny it was kennedys speech in 80 i laughed with kennedy when he was needling ronald reagan
9128775 most guys curse me out from a distance on those kind of plays you can tell
9128776 so i try not to make eye contact with those guys unless its a friend of mine marlons a good guy but i just didnt want to make eye contact with him because i know hes pretty upset
9128777 it was a long run and the ball was beating me there so i knew i had to get over the wall and i caught it face first going into the wall
9128778 it was pretty painful it felt like mike tyson hit me i tasted the green monster and it was pretty nasty it tasted like collard greens id like a strawberry wall out there or something like that
9128779 i was 0 for 3 tonight but you can make it up with your glove because that never goes into a slump
9128780 to do that was big i was excited that one is pretty high on my list
9128781 when youre playing every day mike scioscia usually does something out of the norm to spark some interest hes wont just xerox the lineup and throw the same one out there every day mikes always been the type of manager who isnt going to let us spin our wheels too long and he isnt afraid to change anything but i still had to approach it like i do when im further down in the lineup
9128782 he really held a pretty good team down and got us deep into the ballgame but we left a pitch up in the zone in the sixth and you dont leave pitches up in the zone to garret anderson too often and that was one that he took out i was hoping that he missed it but he didnt
9128783 ive been on the other end of that ive been 40 games out before so i know what that feels like
9128784 you have to think how does that fit into the dynamics of your clubhouse
9128785 thats the situation that were in and obviously im not going to abuse him
9128786 ill never abuse any pitcher hopefully there are some days when we score a lot of runs and we dont have to use him but the last two days weve had to use him a lot
9128787 in those type of games thats what you have to do
9128788 theres not a ton of games left and our guys have not been overused theyre strong and we feel they can be strong the month of september and they might be used a little bit different than they were earlier
9128789 i turned around and theres a guy but what can you do you just have to refocus again
9128790 what were going to do were going to see how he does today facing the hitters
9128791 the one thing that weve done is we have not rushed this and we have not tried to get ahead of ourselves and we wont do that but after today s performance well make an evaluation to see if the next step is whether he needs more time or possibly we can activate him or whatever we need to do
9128792 well we couldnt necessarily bring him back as a starter if we activated him right away just because hes not built up

9128805 with haren and webby going the next two days we have a chance of being up six and a half games pretty easy its looking good

9128807 we need to get at least one more of these
9128808 i did say a bad word which would get me thrown out
9128809 ive got a lot of clicking and popping going on in there right now and its pretty painful
9128810 we are seeking to terminate it the merger agreement and obtain judicial confirmation that hexion has no obligation to pursue the acquisition or to pay huntsman a termination fee
9128811 the duff amp phelps opinion lacks credibility which we are confident the upcoming delaware trial will show
9128812 this financing serves the dual purpose of enhancing what we believe is your already reasonable rate of return and facilitating a mutually beneficial resolution of the current disagreement between you and huntsman
9128813 while we appreciate the efforts of these shareholders due to the dramatic increase in huntsmans net debt and decrease in its earnings since last july their proposal does not come close to making the combined company solvent
9128814 over the last two decades in the us even while flu vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality
9128815 further only about 10 percent of winter time deaths in the us are attributable to influenza thus to suggest that the vaccine can reduce 50 percent of deaths from all causes is implausible in our opinion
9128816 was very small and statistically non significant and may simply be a healthy user artifact that they were unable to identify
9128817 previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated a healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9128818 the healthy user effect is seen in what doctors often refer to as their good patients patients who are well informed about their health who exercise regularly do not smoke or have quit drink only in moderation take their medications exactly as prescribed and quite religiously get vaccinated each year so as to stay healthy
9128819 such attributes are almost impossible to capture in large scale studies using administrative databases
9128820 smoking during pregnancy is a double edged sword with respect to sids
9128821 not only does it raise a mothers likelihood of having a preterm baby who is already among the most vulnerable to sids but it increases the infants susceptibility to sids even further
9128822 preterm premature babies are known to have increased breathing difficulties in proportion to their prematurity and cigarette smoke is known to increase apneas in full term babies
9128823 but until now cigarette smoke exposure and preterm birth have not been investigated together with respect to their potential effects on respiratory dysfunction
9128824 what the plan is to ever end the war that were engaged in
9128825 may also not be impressed that shes leaving her four month old downs baby for more than two months so she can campaign or that she is alternately dragging him across the country but maybe not as turned off by that as they would be that palin is not just pro life but opposes exceptions rape incest or for the life of the mother so she thinks that if a 12 year old girl is raped and impregnated by her father and then her fetus turns out to be non viable and will die upon delivery the girl cannot get an abortion even if she could die in delivery as well nice as governor palin vetoed wind power and clean coal projects including a 50 megawatt wind farm on fire island and a clean coal facility in healy that had been mired in a dispute between local and state governments

9128833 if you think of the u s 20 years ago i think this is happening now in brazil women are rethinking their roles
9128834 women are embracing their success and independence while firmly rejecting brazils machismo past and theyre ready to deal with the push back

9128856 at the moment we wouldnt accept liability for the fire we dont believe it should be on charged to us and a legal argument would have to be sorted out in court
9128857 my understanding of it is its the total cost of the fire suppression effort including fire engines i imagine they were of a significant cost and were destroyed but i imagine they have insurance
9128858 no invoice has been given to the waikato district council and until thats the case until the council respond to that we simply dont know i would have thought that the council would have had insurers to have claimed that on anyway
9128859 as to whether the fire service tries to recoup those costs its not for me to say as we havent had those costs
9128860 its in a rural area and we are the rural fire authority

9128866 modern art modern lives then now comprised of rarely seen work drawn exclusively from local private collections and our own permanent collection is one of the museums most ambitious and broad reaching exhibitions
9128867 never before have austinites had the chance to see works by modern masters pushing at the boundaries of art in conjunction with the contemporary artists who are confronting the tough issues of our times
9128868 drawing largely on the unique resources of the boston college faculty in multiple disciplines the mcmullen is pleased to offer this re examination and in several cases new interpretations of georges rouaults oeuvre in the most comprehensive exhibition of his work mounted in north america in several decades
9128869 this irony a sometimes bitterly satirical one was often glossed over by a conventional piety in the presentation of his work from the time of his death in 1958 until the centenary of his birth in 1971
9128870 such dark reflections are redeemed for rouault by the human masques qualifier
9128871 the upper east side mothers approach was unorthodox to put it mildly
9128872 its almost comical because we both want the epa to act
9128873 we dont have a full understanding why epa hasnt acted
9128874 when we look around at what the epa has approved in other states texas rules meet the benchmarks
9128875 a vehicle for epa to rubber stamp deficient texas air permitting rules
9128876 weve just been in this limbo because no one at epa has acted on it
9128877 industry could get a schedule for epa to act from its lawsuit and thats good but were also saying these rules are problems that need to be fixed
9128878 the thing i told hagans was just keep polishing your game
9128879 he could really develop into one of those guys that can do a lot of things for you
9128880 i cant try to hit a home run just because they are seeing me play for the first time
9128881 there was no indication on the putting green when i was warming up that it was going to be like that
9128882 i just tried to keep the pedal down because i knew the scores were pretty low
9128883 it is important for him to pitch before the season ends he doesnt care what role that is he just wants to pitch as much as he can before the season ends so that hes comfortable going into spring training
9128884 we have talked about starting and we have talked about reliever hes not against either one
9128885 if they want me to pitch out of the bullpen ill pitch out of the pen
9128886 its going to be what they want me to do i want to pitch i want to be able to go out there and compete
9128887 didnt feel like there was any strength to get the ball going friday i felt strong it was a better feel than in my starts
9128888 the only time we practice is if theres a reason why i think its important to get in the facility pinkel said
9128889 we have an indoor facility but you cant duplicate this i just wanted the punt returners kick returners and receivers to get the ball up in the lights to be prepared for it
9128890 the biggest thing for the receivers is how to line up our offense with all of those hash marks pinkel said
9128891 people try to talk about the punt and kickoff returns but thats no big deal he said
9128892 we played in three domes last year and will play in two this year
9128893 theyre disguising so much more and they have so many more blitz packages and capabilities daniel said
9128894 coach eberflus put it into effect and it screwed us up a couple of times but we finally got the hang of it its a lot different from last year and might give other offenses problems
9128895 the last three or four practices he was probably just a little more consistent zook said
9128896 we could have drawn names out of a hat i told the other guys just keep kicking it may be over it may not be over
9128897 certain kinds of organisms have been known to get in and not necessarily cause any harm

9128903 the temporary impact of the stimulus has passed and it looks like consumer spending is on track to decline in real terms in the third quarter
9128904 its certainly a wake up call to people who yesterday looked at the gdp report and said hey the economy grew by 3
9128905 looking forward the consumer is on her own theres no tax cut no fiscal stimulus for the remainder of 2008
9128906 well be lucky if when we get into the fourth quarter we get anything positive from the consumer
9128907 some of the run up is bleeding into or being passed through other nonfood and energy prices like airfares
9128908 everybody no matter what business youre in has energy costs to produce products and energy costs to transport products
9128909 their view is that slow growth in the economy and lower commodity prices will eventually bring inflation down without them stepping in and having to raise interest rates
9128910 i dont think the numbers here would shift their present view
9128911 theres not enough domestic economic activity to keep the industrial sector afloat
9128912 now with the dollar weak relatively speaking the industrial sector is largely meeting the demand needs of foreigners
9128913 it says theres a real thirst for voice and representation among the workforce today
9128914 at that stage in my career i wanted to improve myself and i was a company man
9128915 but once i realized that didnt get me anywhere i really had no alternative
9128916 this is not about the lawyers and the accountants its about public health and our consumers and people thats where were spending our time and attention
9128917 i think he is doing all the right things he and his people ignoring lawyers and ignoring financial considerations to be in position to re establish the brand when this gets behind them
9128918 you cant fight a game like this by saying i cant say anything because the lawyers dont want me to
9128919 he was seen as a take charge guy but he could rub people the wrong way
9128920 for quite a long time i used to drop into his office for an hour or so early in the morning and chat with him we still do it but not nearly so often
9128921 thats a leap i dont know if anyone is groomed for a situation things evolve
9128922 we are made wise not by the recollection of our past but by the responsibility for our future
9128923 for the last 40 years everyone has been trying to poke holes in it but they keep coming back to this being the most transparent way to capture the essence of the market
9128924 looking at our returns theyre going to underperform in a highly growth dominated market like weve seen in the past 12 months
9128925 so why not take away the worry about the credit
9128926 in the glare of international attention it seems that even the government itself has acknowledged that this punishment was harsh and inappropriate
9128927 the big idea here is not only about deterring bad guys from going through but also good guys who just came out realized they forgot their cellphone in there and runs back
9128928 its not only about security its about customer service if you have one incident of someone going the wrong way you have to empty the whole terminal
9128929 we did not take lightly the fact we recommended a strike
9128930 this is not just talking about 27 000 members this is talking about 27 000 members and their families
9128931 we are more than willing to talk to the union and discuss the contract with them in more detail that said this is truly our final offer
9128932 were extremely disappointed that the union is recommending that our employees reject what adds up to the best contract in the aerospace industry
9128933 we hope our employees recognize the value of this offer
9128934 we encourage them to study it calculate what it means to them and their families and vote in their best interests on sept 3 this is our best and final offer and thats what it means
9128935 were supposed to be a world class company but they dont want to give us a world class contract
9128936 boeing is rolling the dice on this theres no question about that
9128937 we wanted to think about the different facets of the phenomenon from his impact on grassroots organizing to the racial components the use of technology the intersection of race and gender
9128938 the social construction of obama understanding the currency of blackness
9128939 hating hillary baiting barack racism misogyny and homophobia in campaign paraphernalia
9128940 i think theres going to be a proliferation of scholarly publications on the guy
9128941 first i think democrats are too sanguine about the long term effect of an obama win on americas standing in the world
9128942 which other presidential candidate in history could reminisce as mr obama does when describing his childhood years in indonesia about the feel of packed mud under bare feet as i wander through paddy fields
9128943 so the window of opportunity will be brief im concerned about mismatched expectations between the united states on the one hand and its allies and partners on the other many americans think as soon as president bush departs the rest of the world will be more willing to share our burdens many allies think as soon as president bush departs washington will start listening to us more
9128944 i think he really will have an impact on what goes on in the classroom
9128945 hes the first african american candidate and that obviously is going to get him a lot of attention scholarly and otherwise
9128946 i definitely think it will trickle down into the classroom
9128947 its all the students want to talk about and it really is a new chapter in the textbooks
9128948 the assumption is that its going to be like part of the campaign all positive but thats not true were by nature critical
9128949 it will be a snapshot and it will be fascinating to see how we capture and fail to capture what is or is not going on with regard to our countrys narrative of race
9128950 examining our post racial selves obama as a balm for what ails us
9128951 much of the buzz both positive and negative surrounding obama indicates that america remains bogged down by many historically based sociocultural notions of race
9128952 society likes to fit people into discrete boxes and obama defies and resists this tendency towards stereotypical essentialization he is both black and white and of america yet global in his appeal
9128953 he is progressive on some issues moderate on others and he has been able to be a crossover success in an american political landscape often said to be uneasy with those with foreign sounding names from urban centres he has already accomplished what many would have reasonably prophesied as unattainable in this socio political terrain
9128954 what will obamas candidacy do for the multiracial movement in the united states
9128955 does the success of particular individuals say anything or much about the possibilities for other members of that persons group
9128956 if he wins his candidacy and victory is likely to be included in u s history and government textbooks
9128957 if he loses he is likely to be included but more as a footnote and probably in a section dealing with african american history
9128958 and theres this guy from brazil name starts with a b banka or something blanka yeah blanka hes green and makes electricity
9128959 geoffrey was one of the kindest much loved and uniquely talented people we knew he genuinely made the world a funnier place
9128960 it is an absolute tragedy and our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time
9128961 bike commuting in ny has grown more than 75 since 2000 the most frequent complaints is that theres nowhere to put your bike once you get to work we need to do more to provide city employees a safe secure place to lock their bikes

9128995 we do so not because someone asks us and we want to look good to them we are doing it because this is consistent with our national interests because in these areas our national interests coincide with those of many european countries and the united states

9128998 everyone will chime in saying ah now the church is saying its sorry 400 years too late
9128999 more than darwin or any other figure he represents the idea that there is a conflict between science and the church
9129000 had much to suffer at the hands of individuals and institutions within the church
9129001 we opened the secret vatican archives and tried to understand everything we could about galileos position
9129002 youve got a lot of art inside there already some of it from great masters so where do you put a statue of galileo
9129003 its an effort to make him a symbol an attempt to make galileo one of the emblems of the church
9129004 its the church which needs rehabilitation on this case not galileo he was right
9129005 what happened in georgia is a good sign one that means america is no longer the sole world power setting the rules of the game
9129006 there is a balance in the world now russia is resurging which is good for us for the entire middle east
9129007 this russian invasion of georgia is a turning point in the relations of the atlantic community with russia including of course turkey
9129008 there is a change in the paradigm a change in assessment
9129009 not deceive the american people regarding the danger of terrorism and the need to fight it
9129010 the americans aspire for their country to take a moral stance be an honest broker act in accordance with the u s constitution not ignite wars not spill the blood of innocents in the world and not deceive the american people regarding the danger of terrorism and the need to fight it
9129011 i urged him to move ahead in the israel syria negotiations as much as possible so that whoever is the next president would not start from too far down the track
9129012 i did not say anything about obama or mccain i said whoever is the next president is not going to want to inherit a process that isnt going anywhere
9129013 if one of senator obamas advisers has been to damascus we just wonder how many have been to tehran
9129014 we oppose the appointment of kurtzer because of his long documented record of hostility to and severe pressure upon israel
9129015 with jews like kurtzer it is impossible to build a healthy relationship between israel and the united states
9129016 frequently pressured israel to make one sided concessions to the arabs he constantly blamed israel for the absence of mideast peace and paid little or no attention to the fact that the palestinians were carrying out terrorist attacks and openly calling for the destruction of israel
9129017 kurtzer will use his jewishness as a protective cover for his anti israel views
9129018 possibly more than any other u s state department official kurtzer has been instrumental in promoting the goals of the palestinians and in raising their afflictions to the center of the u s policymakers agenda
9129019 attacked the israeli government for refusing to include the plo in the peace process and said that this constituted the main obstacle to peace
9129020 dance has been considered one of the arts as is sculpture painting and anything else like that what clarence has is a club where people can come and perform
9129021 are you saying that minors cant be protected can a group of 12 year olds come down and go in and dance nude and its ok i dont think thats what the legislature had in mind when it made those additional provisions
9129022 given the first amendment implications of a statute that may limit expression it is not the role of the court to judge the taste or quality of the art represented at shotgun geniez when determining whether or not it is a theater
9129023 chairs and tables arranged for patrons to observe the stage presentations
9129024 shotgun geniez is a facility for presentation of stage performances and meets the definition of theatre

9129026 it is my firm conviction that our missionary church will flourish and missionaries will make a richer and more courageous contribution to the church as a result of the martyrdom of our beloved fr thomas
9129027 peaceful rallies across the country to register strong protest against the repeated attacks
9129028 the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church
9129029 may his soul and all the souls of the faithful departed rest in peace
9129030 on this very sad occasion of the brutal murder of our beloved fr
9129031 fr thomas is a martyr he sacrificed his life for the poor and the marginalized he did not die in vain because his body and his blood enrich the church in india particularly the church in andhra pradesh
9129032 what we need is a quick start a quick goal and then focus on getting the second one
9129033 we are definitely not taking them lightly as they are a fit team but we are better and well need to prove it on the field losing on sunday really bothered a lot of the guys theyll be ready for sure theres no doubt about that
9129034 ultimately a deep bench is crucial to winning this coming sunday and i expect a completely different pistolas team than last night
9129035 well have our keeper back our scoring leader and a host of other lethal weapons the key for us is really a deep bench weve now played two years together and had a great run this year were capable of beating any team in this league if we communicate pass well and get back to support our stellar defense we have by far the best keeper in the league we have guys coming off well desrved rest in eckleton andrew t eddy m davidinho and ronaldo if all goes to plan i expect a squad of 18 motivated guys this sunday looking to seek revenge on this silver team there are many different options and weapons on this team but the determination and heart is going to really be important in pulling together take no team lightly lets win this sunday boys
9129036 ive been advised by pistolas fc medical staff to not play for a month
9129037 which really means i hope to be back august 31st for the playoffs

9129044 there isnt a woman in the world that doesnt have a friend or a partner whos actually experiencing some sort of violence against them so i think although domestic violence hasnt happened to me personally i certainly know women who are dealing with this struggle every day
9129045 domestic violence affects women who are famous who are not famous women who have money women who have no money this is an issue that crosses all boundaries and it certainly affects everyone

9129054 genom att v lja en f rv rvsarbetande mor med ord om sig att f saker och ting gjorda s har senator mccain p nytt visat sin fasta beslutsamhet att reformera washington

9129057 det st rsta politiska v gspelet i amerikas politiska historia
9129058 youve been accused of making the same album 12 times how do you respond to that
9129059 he wanted it a little bit more than we did
9129060 wed stopped on a play and he kept going you have got to go until the whistle blows they did that and we didnt
9129061 the atmosphere was great but coming into a game like this we have got to get more focused
9129062 we had a good week of practice but we just had here and there moments in the game we have got to pick it up
9129063 i was just able to bounce outside and get the yards that i got
9129064 everybody has got to remember that he is just a sophomore he has got to make some decisions and make some reads he has got to deal with the pressure there are some growing pains but i think hes progressing nicely
9129065 they are going to be bigger than us they are going to have a big and tall quarterback who can run we are going to have our hands full again
9129066 would you continue state funding for the proposed knik arm and gravina island bridges
9129067 yes i would like to see alaskas infrastructure projects built sooner rather than later the window is now while our congressional delegation is in a strong position to assist
9129068 i told them before the game and at the end of the game everything were doing defensively offensively everything is brand new
9129069 as long as were getting better every week thats all i can ask for i feel like we got better in the second half
9129070 coach took us into halftime and told us the game was not over
9129071 he told me to keep the ball on the play because the defensive ends were crashing but the run was all my offensive line not me
9129072 before and after every practice me and o c work out a lot together
9129073 our teammates call him o c we work out probably 20 to 30 minutes just me and him hes told me if i threw the ball up hed go get it he was right tonight
9129074 we had our chances in the red zone three or four times and didnt score
9129075 were going to work on more red zone offense we came out with a renewed vigor in the second half if we can cut out our mistakes next week and penalties i think we have a chance to do some special things
9129076 it was a new week and we had to start over from scratch
9129077 we just had to play hard and give it our all
9129078 the kids played well but were capable of playing a lot better
9129079 where he goes we go he sets the pace of the game
9129080 thats what this defense is all about were going to come
9129081 we had to stay pumped up keep intense just work together as a team
9129082 i just love the sport i love to play and make the coaches happy do what they say and keep them satisfied
9129083 got the ladies of the eighties from here to white castle
9129084 we went to white castle and we got thrown out
9129085 from nearly two hundred centres and every week added to their number roared the unquenchable crimson conflagrations of the s the flimsy fabric of the worlds credit had vanished industry was completed disorganised and every city every thickly populated area was starving or trembled on the verge of starvation most of the capital cities of the world were burning millions of people had already perished and over great areas government was at an end
9129086 this is one emergency that we cant drill our way out of
9129087 the release of carbon dioxide is massive in this country
9129088 a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9129089 the broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w
9129090 a champion for working americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours
9129091 because defenders of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
9129092 cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9129093 set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9129094 same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
9129095 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
9129096 with the nomination of sen barack obama tonight the man who will lead the democratic party in its march toward the white house we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
9129097 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9129098 innovation in both business methodology and technology is capable of having profound effects on the degree that society adopts a truly green lifestyle and so we are excited to bring clean technology and innovation together at this years west coast green
9129099 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
9129100 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9129101 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9129102 the other 52 percent will say she damaged him too much and five or six of us will say you should have let us do our job
9129103 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to be president thats a debate id like to have
9129104 people think they can support him but hes a mystery inexperience is about not knowing him
9129105 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 per cent of the time
9129106 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
9129107 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9129108 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9129109 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own
9129110 our government should work for us not against us it should help us not hurt us it should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every american whos willing to work
9129111 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper
9129112 i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9129113 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
9129114 the experience lincolns supporters valued most in that race was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9129115 he was known chiefly as a clear thinker and a great orator with a passion for justice and a determination to heal the deep divisions of our land he insisted on reaching past partisan and regional divides to exalt our common humanity in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9129116 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream the acceptance of a democratic presidential nominee decided not by the colour of his skin but by the content of his character
9129117 right now in the second week of may 2006 we are facing perhaps the worst gas crisis in history
9129118 we have way too much gasoline gas is down to 19 cents a gallon and the oil companies are hurting i know that i am partly to blame by insisting that cars run on trash i am therefore proposing a federal bail out to our oil companies because hey if it were the other way around you know the oil companies would help us
9129119 i think he brought it to a new level of attention and validity that we hadnt had before
9129120 al gore has been warning us of the dangers of climate change for more than twenty years
9129121 when al won an academy award for his fine documentary an inconvenient truth i was thrilled america was finally listening to the lecture hed given me every week for eight years
9129122 he had written a great book before he was chosen as vice president
9129123 its easy to take shots its part of being a public figure and being in public office you catch a lot of arrows
9129124 al gore knew more about the importance of the rain forest than the scientists
9129125 i asked him a couple of questions and he began a tutorial flying 30 000 feet over the rain forest he told us how the important the rain forest was to the environment and how it affected weather patterns i didnt know that stuff it was one of those life changing moments that ill never forget
9129126 ask not what your country can do for you but ask what you can do for your country
9129127 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because janet reno is her father
9129128 im getting a good feeling about this totally reinforces the presumptive gop nominees maverick image undercuts the democratic attempt to tie our man to george w bush
9129129 but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9129130 we may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country
9129131 a president who ends the global scourge of aids in our time
9129132 the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9129133 but surely we can agree that our gay brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9129134 gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9129135 she shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade
9129136 gov palin and john mccain are a good match because they both want to overturn roe v wade
9129137 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9129138 when as many as three supreme court justices could be appointed in the first term of the next president and john mccain promises to appoint more scalias and thomases and end a womans right to choose it is time for a change
9129139 in an era when over 80 percent of downs syndrome babies are aborted the palins feel they have been extremely blessed by god to raise an absolutely perfect son
9129140 gov palin continues to use her testimony to advance protections for unborn children
9129141 will i get a nominee who will keep his word to me in the vetting process if any word is actually given
9129142 we all know that dance nobody actually admits they ask the roe question and the question doesnt get asked and it doesnt get answered and therefore the nominees get on the bench and they do what they want
9129143 in a stadium like this it felt like one living organism
9129144 people are really going to see which venue looks more like america and its this one
9129145 he thoroughly and compellingly explained his plan for change with specific distinctions between what government should be responsible for and personal responsibility
9129146 we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need
9129147 i cant imagine why youd have a hard time making up your mind
9129148 its important to understand how our democracy works not just looking on television but to participate is important to me
9129149 i believe we wouldnt be in iraq in his administration mcnally said
9129150 i think you get the handlers in there and you just get lost
9129151 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9129152 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9129153 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9129154 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9129155 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9129156 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9129157 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9129158 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9129159 so tell me mr guccione what exactly did you win this one for
9129160 malcolm just think of him as one of the warner brothers he just signs the cheques
9129161 oh my god i cant believe were going to actually shoot this
9129162 oh malcolm i saw caligula ive seen it three times its frightfully good
9129163 wont even follow bin laden to the cave where he lives
9129164 sought to transcend race and find a plane of unity
9129165 stronger than when he arrived but still with a hill to climb
9129166 right now the united states imports about 70 of its oil from overseas at the same time billions of dollars that we spend on all that foreign oil seems to end up in the bank accounts of those around the world who are openly hostile to american values and our way of life this costly reliance on fossil fuels threatens america and the world in other ways too co2 emissions are increasing global temperatures sea levels are rising and storms are getting worse
9129167 borrowing money from china to buy oil from saudi arabia
9129168 borrow ing money from china to buy oil from countries that dont like us
9129169 as i have said for many years throughout this land were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9129170 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9129171 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for twenty six of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9129172 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
9129173 washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
9129174 in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels and today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9129175 now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stop gap measure not a long term solution not even close
9129176 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9129177 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
9129178 ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
9129179 and ill invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9129180 both candidates are talking about energy high prices and global warming so its important to look past the rhetoric and see what is at the heart of their plans
9129181 as this scorecard illustrates the contrast in this election could not be starker
9129182 barack obama wants to give tax relief and 1 000 energy rebates to working families while john mccain wants billions more in tax breaks for oil companies making more than 1 000 a second in profits
9129183 thats why i came here tonight to tell you why i feel so strongly that we must seize this opportunity to elect barack obama president of the united states of america
9129184 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9129185 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of humankind
9129186 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
9129187 many scientists predict shockingly that the entire north polar ice cap may be completely gone during summer months during the first term of the next president
9129188 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger military experts warn us our national security is threatened by massive waves of climate refugees destabilizing countries around the world and scientists tell us the very web of life is endangered by unprecedented extinctions
9129189 in spite of john mccains past record of open mindedness and leadership on the climate crisis he has now apparently allowed his party to browbeat him into abandoning his support of mandatory caps on global warming pollution
9129190 the carbon fuels industry big oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and they are drilling it for everything its worth
9129191 that america is the best country on earth and a place where everybody if they work hard can achieve great things
9129192 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
9129193 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
9129194 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
9129195 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
9129196 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
9129197 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
9129198 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
9129199 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
9129200 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
9129201 oh can you take care of her oh maybe you can spare her several moments of your consideration leading up to the final destination
9129202 oh the earth is calling out i wanna learn what its all about but everything i read global warming going green i dont know what all this means but it seems to be saying wake up america
9129203 hes a hero hes going to bring pollution down to zero
9129204 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
9129205 stand up ill try if you will wake up its not a fire drill
9129206 the only time i ever saw my mother really angry was when she saw cruelty
9129207 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
9129208 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
9129209 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
9129210 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
9129211 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
9129212 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
9129213 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
9129214 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
9129215 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
9129216 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
9129217 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
9129218 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
9129219 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
9129220 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
9129221 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
9129222 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
9129223 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
9129224 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
9129225 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
9129226 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
9129227 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
9129228 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
9129229 i knew abe abe was a friend of mine and baracks no lincoln
9129230 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
9129231 being in like minded company with people who support the cause
9129232 it was inspiring to see the mix of black and white old and young
9129233 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
9129234 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
9129235 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
9129236 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
9129237 we must seize this opportunity to elect united states of america
9129238 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis
9129239 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9129240 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of mankind
9129241 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9129242 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9129243 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9129244 the five senators alan cranston d ca dennis deconcini d az john glenn d oh john mccain r az and donald w
9129245 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 8 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9129246 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should ive got greenspans book
9129247 the myth that john mccain ever said he would keep troops in harms way in iraq for 100 years
9129248 as long as americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9129249 weve had thousands die in the first few years and mccain wants to keep it up for 100 more years
9129250 mccain and keating had become personal friends following their initial contacts in 1981 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
9129251 so long as they are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed
9129252 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
9129253 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
9129254 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
9129255 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
9129256 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
9129257 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
9129258 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
9129259 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
9129260 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
9129261 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
9129262 living next to you is in some ways like sleeping with an elephant no matter how friendly and even tempered the beast one is affected by every twitch and grunt
9129263 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families we would not be showing contempt for the constitution wed be protecting the rights of every american regardless of race religion disability gender or sexual orientation
9129264 with profound gratitude and great humility i accept your nomination for the presidency of the united states
9129265 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9129266 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again the last best hope for those who are called to the cause of peace
9129267 i get it i realise that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
9129268 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9129269 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me
9129270 on november 4 we must stand up and say eight years is enough
9129271 let there be no doubt the republican nominee john mccain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
9129272 im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
9129273 i dont believe senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans i just think he doesnt know
9129274 why else would he define middle class as someone making under us5 million a year
9129275 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
9129276 hes now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them
9129277 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9129278 look bro we are reaching if not already reached peak oil peak coal and peak natural gas
9129279 and this is the revolution is it more like some kind of joke if you ask me so what happens when
9129280 my high points were steve hookers and matthew mitchams golds both against the odds one low po
9129281 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
9129282 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
9129283 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
9129284 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope
9129285 i went on a trip to europe with my father and mother
9129286 and everywhere we went we were met by vast crowds of people hundreds of thousands of people who came out into the street because they wanted to be near to an american politician and it wasnt because his brother had been martyred three years before
9129287 our nation was the most loved nation on the face of the earth because we were regarded as an exemplary nation
9129288 it took 230 years of discipline restraint and visionary leadership by republican and democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of love and adoration for the united states for the past seven years through monumental arrogance and incompetence we have drained those reservoirs dry anyone who thinks its good for our country when hezbollah is more popular in the middle east than the us has their head in an oil well
9129289 his life has been the 21st century incarnation of the american dream
9129290 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
9129291 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
9129292 kontakta stora daldansens styrelse med f rslag om att eventuellt inleda f rhandlingar med falu kommun om stora daldansens framtid
9129293 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
9129294 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
9129295 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
9129296 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
9129297 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
9129298 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
9129299 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks

9129301 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9129302 i get it i realize that im not the likeliest candidate for this office
9129303 i stood before you and told you my story of the brief union between a young man from kenya and a young woman from kansas who werent well off or well known but shared a belief that in america their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to
9129304 one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
9129305 i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9129306 ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
9129307 let freedom ring from the snow capped rockies of colorado
9129308 to be able to fill up a stadium like this one the last night of the convention has never been done before
9129309 all these people wanted the opportunity to see and hear
9129310 we have come so far to have so many people of so many races to feel the same way about one person im very proud that we have come this far
9129311 there is an electricity about this convention that i dont remember from the three other democratic conventions that i have attended
9129312 sial sudah seharian ngumpul orang gila sekarang ban mobil gue kempes lagi
9129313 ngga tahu masa kita mesti jalan ke bengkel cari mur
9129314 ambil aja dari masing masing roda satu mur lalu pasang di situ ntar kalau sudah ketemu bengkel baru beli mur lagi
9129315 loh bapak tadi bisa ngasih saya ide cemerlang lalu kenapa bapak bisa di rumah sakit jiwa
9129316 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
9129317 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
9129318 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
9129319 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
9129320 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
9129321 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
9129322 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
9129323 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
9129324 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
9129325 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
9129326 i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace who yearn for a better future
9129327 america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to walk into the future
9129328 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security
9129329 the lunar infrastructure as proposed by the late gerard k oneill is well thought out
9129330 lastly i wanted to say that these figures are based on current residential demand
9129331 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
9129332 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
9129333 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
9129334 the thing about obama is that even if he doesnt deliver hell at least make the rest of us want to f ing deliver
9129335 he gets you charged up to do something and hes a symbol of hope i doubt hell change the world but he may just provide us with the motivation
9129336 it shows the ignorance of people in america that he was voted in for a second term i just couldnt fathom it
9129337 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
9129338 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
9129339 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
9129340 i actually wind everyone else up it keeps me going through the day i have to do something because it drains me in class
9129341 its not to disrespect the teachers its just the long days and people talking and talking youve just got to have a bit of a laugh you have to wind people up wind the teachers up
9129342 i like to be original i personally think its too easy for me i need to think about it i need a challenge i go for the sharp humour
9129343 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
9129344 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
9129345 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
9129346 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
9129347 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
9129348 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
9129349 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
9129350 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
9129351 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
9129352 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
9129353 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
9129354 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
9129355 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
9129356 the group 70 foundation fund is a donor advised fund at hawaii community foundation it is unique because it is funded by employee contributions so management steps back and employees select the organizations
9129357 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community
9129358 group 70 foundation is unique because management steps back and employees run the program
9129359 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community
9129360 when we formed group 70 foundation we collectively wished to demonstrate our commitment to building better communities in hawaii beyond our professional services our priority is to give back to hawaii our home the foundation is a testimony to our shared values of generosity civic duty service and philosophy we are pleased to once again have such a worthy group of recipients each of whom contributes to a sustainable hawaii in their own way
9129361 i feel very fortunate to be part of an organization that gives so much back to the community i especially appreciate it because of organizations like the y after school art programs and community centers that had helped keep me out of trouble and encouraged me in the right direction ive always imagined that one day id set up some sort of a trust or scholarship program to give back however since im not in a position to do so right now i am happy that i have the group 70 foundation to help me fulfill some of that dream
9129362 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
9129363 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
9129364 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
9129365 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
9129366 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
9129367 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
9129368 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
9129369 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
9129370 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
9129371 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
9129372 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
9129373 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
9129374 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
9129375 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
9129376 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
9129377 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
9129378 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
9129379 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
9129380 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
9129381 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
9129382 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
9129383 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
9129384 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
9129385 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
9129386 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
9129387 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
9129388 seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9129389 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
9129390 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
9129391 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
9129392 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
9129393 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
9129394 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
9129395 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
9129396 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
9129397 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
9129398 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
9129399 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
9129400 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
9129401 in four short years bush turned that around and we now have debt for years to come
9129402 right now we need to campaign on turning virginia from a red state to a blue state
9129403 im talking to people every day who were republicans forever but are just not able to do it this year
9129404 for years and years they bought the plan to cut taxes but the middle class now is beginning to catch up with that idea and understand that a trick has been pulled on them
9129405 i want to vote for somebody who is going to deliver what he says he is going to do
9129406 forget about the wealthy think about the people and help the middle class rather than the wealthy
9129407 we have got a good start but we have our work cut out for us all across the country
9129408 we need to bring the lost to the light and reap the harvest
9129409 this election if probably one of the most important of my grandchildrens lives
9129410 i think historically we have left behind the disadvantaged and the people the policy was developed for
9129411 i think obama has done things more than any candidate to reach out to my generation
9129412 compare that to john mccain who said he barely knew how to use the internet and had to have help from his wife
9129413 the campaign of barack obama and joe biden is a very exciting one
9129414 we want a change that is going to help us all
9129415 their strength is not only how they campaign but how they govern
9129416 even during the cold war during the harsh confrontation between the soviet union and the united states we always avoided direct clashes between our civilians even more so between our military personnel
9129417 ordinary experts even if they teach military affairs should not do so in combat zones but in training areas and training centers
9129418 what was the purpose of that gentleman being among the special forces and what is he doing today i so far cannot answer
9129419 as a follow up to my below post picking a female vp makes it very difficult for obama to execute the second part of his strategy painting mccain as the same as bush
9129420 maybe they wont notice that i am taking john mccains straight talk express campaign themes
9129421 i dont think so america knows mccain just sold out the country for a politic tactical stunt the woman has no experience on diversity of economics no national experience with any issue if the 72 year old kicks the bucket so would we as a country this woman is soooooo under qualified
9129422 now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of ceo bonuses
9129423 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
9129424 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
9129425 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
9129426 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
9129427 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
9129428 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
9129429 to put conservative values and conservative ideas into the thick of the fight for justice and opportunity
9129430 they had their chance they have not led we will
9129431 on occasion he rambled through excessive repetition bush is most effective in personal contact not a set speech
9129432 how and what we do for all of you the people who pay the taxes bear the burdens and live the american dream
9129433 cant understand how a guy like george w bush can be leading a guy with the kind of caliber experience and know how as al gore
9129434 make sure that our prosperity enriches not just the few but all working families
9129435 i believe we must challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning
9129436 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
9129437 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
9129438 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
9129439 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
9129440 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
9129441 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
9129442 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
9129443 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
9129444 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
9129445 karena secara pribadi saya sudah melahirkan lebih dari duapuluh karya televisi
9129446 jadi kalau berbicara mengenai siapa yang berjasa menerjunkan saya di dunia entertainment saya harus menyebut dua nama itu
9129447 saya memproyeksikan indonesia menjadi negara maju setelah china dan india
9129448 jika kecenderungan harga minyak sawit menurun maka langkah kedua negara menghasilkan biodiesel boleh memastikan penawaran komoditas tersebut di pasaran tidak berlebihan sehingga menyebabkan harganya jatuh
9129449 pengusaha malaysia tertarik menanam modal di sini kaarena melihat potensinya ke depan
9129450 untuk itu kami mengimbau media massa tak menyebarkan laporan laporan yang memperkeruh suasana dan hendaknya melihat hubuingan jangka panjang kedua negara bertetangga
9129451 banyak di kalangan kedua negara terutama generasi muda tidak mengetahui atau lupa akan sejarah itu termasuk ciri ciri kebiasaan hidup bahasa dan budaya akibat dari migrasi penduduk sebelum abad kedua puluh
9129452 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
9129453 give a man a fish and he will eat for a day teach a man to fish and he w ill sit on a boat drinking beer all day
9129454 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
9129455 give a man a fish and he will eat for a day teach a man to fish and he w ill sit on a boat drinking beer all day

9129458 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
9129459 give a man a fish and he will eat for a day teach a man to fish and he w ill sit on a boat drinking beer all day
9129460 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
9129461 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
9129462 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
9129463 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
9129464 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
9129465 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
9129466 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
9129467 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
9129468 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
9129469 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
9129470 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
9129471 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
9129472 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
9129473 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
9129474 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
9129475 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
9129476 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
9129477 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
9129478 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
9129479 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
9129480 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
9129481 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
9129482 give a man a fish and he will eat for a day teach a man to fish and he w ill sit on a boat drinking beer all day
9129483 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
9129484 if a couple ever stops fighting over the stupid things they do it just means they stopped caring for one another
9129485 give a man a fish and he will eat for a day teach a man to fish and he w ill sit on a boat drinking beer all day
9129486 to the world you may just be a person but to a person you may be the world
9129487 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
9129488 in spite of economic constraints in some markets like the united states on a worldwide basis servers continued to grow in the second quarter of the year
9129489 the most significant driver in the quarter continued to be an upswing of x86 server replacements that started in the first quarter
9129490 at 8 am sharp the first of 230 competitors is lagged away from the start line in what has to rank as the greatest single example of organized anarchy in america
9129491 we are very proud to have started the volume production of our xdr product for ps3 this is a further milestone reflecting our product diversification strategy and demonstrating our leading position in the specialty memory market
9129492 we are prepared to support all our customers with xdr dram in various applications

9129496 no puedo casi recordar cuando vi a mi padre por ltima vez en 1962 afirma r diger crec sin su presencia en casa de mis abuelos ni s donde vive ni financio su huida si estuviese muerto desconozco tambi n d nde puede estar su tumba
9129497 entre 1962 y 1967 encontramos dos notas en nuestro buz n en ellas figuraba una nica frase estoy bien pero no puedo asegurar que esas cartas fueran realmente de mi padre
9129498 gritar a al mundo para que se entregue y responda a las terribles acusaciones
9129499 negarlo no tiene sentido insiste aunque no tengo que explicar a nadie que yo no soy un nazi

9129502 josh josh is that you crawling around in the bushes what are you doing out there in the dark

9129507 your what what are you doing when are you going to come in your fathers itchy real bad and i need my socks
9129508 the way both teams were playing the first ones real big for us
9129509 we need to find a way to get this stuff straightened out
9129510 theres still plenty of time left right now the last couple of weeks have been ugly
9129511 its good to know that were going to be in first place no matter what happens
9129512 with haren and webby going the next two days we have a chance of being up six and a half games pretty easy its looking good
9129513 i dont know i cant answer for everybody guys are playing hard
9129514 its nice to get one in the standings but weve still got two more games in the series
9129515 we need to get at least one more of these
9129516 i did say a bad word which would get me thrown out
9129517 ive got a lot of clicking and popping going on in there right now and its pretty painful
9129518 over the last several weeks myself included weve been pressing a little bit to score runs i hope we can get this momentum and keep going its nice to be on this side of a game like this
9129519 those are probably the best 3 and 4 hitters in the league
9129520 we had good at bats they make good pitches you hit them they make bad pitches you hit them that lifts our confidence weve been fighting through some things
9129521 at this stage every game we play is going to be important
9129522 it takes you a little bit longer to get loose but ill take that every time
9129523 the offense came out scoring and never really let up
9129524 it was like quicksand the harder i tried the faster i fell i have the stuff to pitch at this level right now its a mental game i have to polish it up a little bit i have to get through this
9129525 that pickled egg will be really upset when it finds out the cupcake is a crossdresser
9129526 last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom
9129527 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington
9129528 but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its about you its about you
9129529 what happens from here on in wont matter i just had to be here
9129530 obama represents a down payment on the fulfillment of martins dream
9129531 i never want to live in a vegetative state dependent on some machine and fluids from a bottle to keep me alive that would be no quality of life at all if that ever happens just pull the plug
9129532 to the world you may just be a person but to a person you may be the world
9129533 obviously you saw some other product probably silicon sealant grout is concrete
9129534 i saw a quote from one of your readers that points out a common misconception the reader spoke of hot humid days when heavier denser air is drawn down the chimney contrary to popular belief humid air is not heavier than dry air the opposite is true it actually weighs less we have this situation at times as well though more often in the fall and winter when we get large high pressure systems moving through our midwest location i imagine the candle situation to reverse the flow could work though the cause is not heavy humid air
9129535 unfortunately burning candles simply masks the symptoms and doesnt address the real issue with a stinky fireplace
9129536 there are commercial chimney deodorants that work pretty well and many people have good results with baking soda or even kitty litter set in the fireplace the real problem is the air being drawn down the chimney a symptom of overall pressure problems in the house some make up air should be introduced somewhere else in the house a tight sealing top mounted damper will also reduce this air flow coming down the chimney
9129537 the quilts range from a george washington piece down to examples with nixon and clinton and there are a number of wonderful quilts in between
9129538 there are many people interested in political quilts or quilts that document a historical event
9129539 ive had quilts with the names of political candidates either a name written in or on a political bandanna or ribbon ive had several temperance quilts that had messages about the evils of drink
9129540 theyre very desirable and they always have been any time is a great time to have one but particularly in an election year
9129541 the donkey quilt is folk art its a feed sack political statement
9129542 they can be 1 000 they can be 30 000 or more it depends on the quilt and what it is you look at graphics age colors condition
9129543 the choices we make in life bring upon a lot of sadness and a lot of hurt and a lot of pain
9129544 that moment you finally feel as if youve persevered youre so grateful for the color it added to your character i dont regret one single day
9129545 i just told him today youre the love of my life
9129546 ive kind of been texting him back and forth and hes doing great and lucy is doing great
9129547 im so thankful that my midwife and doctor paid such wonderful attention to me and the little ladies
9129548 and im really glad that i got to 36 weeks with multiples
9129549 it was an honor to receive this last year and its an honor to receive it this year thank you very much
9129550 clooney will play an unapologetic corporate downsizer whose untethered life is consumed by collecting air miles
9129551 he has become a public embarrassment and a bully to my family my coworkers my friends and a girl that means the world to me
9129552 two companies to follow the same principles to a different outcome
9129553 it makes sense to have a single standard but the transition is going to be difficult
9129554 its an immense project this will be like a full employment act for the accounting industry
9129555 simon property group put in roads sewer and water now we own the doughnut around them and our site is fully prepared to develop
9129556 well probably spend 150 million by the time were finished
9129557 our party must continue to strike fear in the heart of the white man our real enemy
9129558 this cabinet i had was the worst in history most of the ministers were unreliable incompetent and spent time attending to their own businesses many abused their power to deny people food
9129559 previous studies were likely measuring a benefit not directly attributable to the vaccine itself but something specific to the individuals who were vaccinated healthy user benefit or frailty bias
9129560 over the last two decades in the united sates even while vaccination rates among the elderly have increased from 15 percent to 65 percent there has been no commensurate decrease in hospital admissions or all cause mortality
9129561 one of the biggest challenges in regenerative medicine is to have a graded continuous interface because anatomically thats how the majority of tissues appear and there are studies that strongly suggest that the graded interface provides better integration and load transfer
9129562 although pesticide exposure is one of four theoretical factors associated with ccd that the united states department of agriculture is researching the facts in this case are not consistent with what is known about ccd
9129563 im not trying to prove anything here i consider this adapting to the environment
9129564 if i was still on level ground like i was before in the other storms i know i would be dreading gustav
9129565 there still tends to be more value put on the things we would like to show our neighbors
9129566 your kids are going to grow faster in these four years than you ever imagined
9129567 no one is luckier than i am because i belong to you
9129568 weve been in these games before played great opponents before and i thought we were playing a little bit anxious maybe because it was the first game of the year
9129569 all the guys who were supposed to make plays did
9129570 we played em all summer long had four passing league games with them and i know coach bob sphire is a great football coach
9129571 i knew wed have to overcome that it was just a matter of us continuing to play and trying to get some breaks
9129572 i think governor palin fits very well with mainstream hoosier values and beliefs indiana republicans and republicans nationally wanted to see him pick someone with strong conservative roots
9129573 governor palin has quickly built a reputation as a reformer and staunch conservative yet a very compassionate individual she is the first female on a republican presidential ticket which shows john mccain is willing to think outside the box and not go with a washington insider which is what the country needs right now
9129574 instead of choosing a running mate who has the experience to be a real partner in bringing change to this country john mccain made a political pick in an attempt to reverse the anxiety republicans are feeling about his campaign
9129575 im glad it wasnt a few other people ive heard mentioned im really going to have to find out more about her and see what shes all about
9129576 just because he has a woman vice president candidate is not enough you have to look at john mccains principles what he stands for maybe a woman will help him maybe not
9129577 one of the elements of this is the statement it makes that mccain is with it enough to recognize the importance of women being included in his leadership team
9129578 hillary clinton was in the race for the nomination and now on the other side sarah palin is senator mccains pick for vice president both are very encouraging very positive signs they signal the receptivity of the nation to see a woman in a top leadership position
9129579 as a woman as a younger person as a family person being out of the west it has some fascinating dynamics to it
9129580 an absolutely fascinating choice palin just wont accept corruption and incompetence she obviously cleaned up what most view as the second most corrupt state in the country
9129581 we passed that and i made my husband turn around so i could get a photo of the road sign
9129582 my grandfather was a nature lover and he turned the empty space into a park
9129583 it was a real treat for my family to eat there
9129584 it was really interesting there was a lot of excitement
9129585 it was a little bit scary too it was almost surreal that they were in our community
9129586 the focus of our team the mentality of our team
9129587 everybody came on day one in training camp ready to go physically mentally and emotionally
9129588 guys are ready to get that 2007 season behind them and move forward
9129589 i think we had a good training camp like i said we had just really one major casualty osi umenyiora as far as injuries and missing a guy for the season for the most part everybody physically came out safe everybody has been attentive
9129590 we kind of left off with what we did on defense as far as running the schemes understanding the schemes and even being able to add a little bit more to our packages i think from a mental standpoint guys are even more focused than they were last year and ready to get off to a fast start
9129591 we have a good group of players and there is good focus
9129592 you look at the strength of our team having had the experience of playing down through the playoffs so you are optimistic about that
9129593 i think we have a team that still feels we have something to prove
9129594 we are just not satisfied with where we are as a team it is a matter of knowing that we have to become a better team and i think that has been our focus when you look at the whole last season the regular season especially you just see so many areas that we can improve on and we were playing football that wasnt our best and we knew we were capable of playing better we just have to work hard on that and just be consistent week in and week out i think that has been our motivation and we know we have to do that
9129595 we have a lot of young guys that have stepped up and made a lot of competition battles at several positions linebacker running back and receiver
9129596 i think that is good for your team it builds character it builds quality
9129597 it isnt something that you wait until the final hour it is ongoing it is the establishment of opinions it is the ranks that occur after every game it is how it all fits together in terms of special teams
9129598 it is always a time of a certain amount of anxiety no matter what because you cant get away from the fact that the mixture is really critical also you have to be aware of how these people are going to fit together and play roles on special teams
9129599 we have to make decisions on first of all what is the status of lawrence tynes and i think that is ongoing fortunately we have a day here when we can continue that progress
9129600 after the olympics a mountain of problems for chinas economy
9129601 its a sad sight to see this brilliant director expending his talents on this exaggerated display of tradition and political propaganda
9129602 im excited ive been hoping for decades to see a woman on the republican ticket and governor palin was worth waiting for a reformer a seasoned executive and best of all normal and authentic great choice
9129603 im always pleased when a woman is given an opportunity for advancement i do think however that while senator barack obama showed impeccable judgment in his selection of senator joe biden who is someone who could step into the white house on day one should that become necessary i think you do have to question senator mccains judgment in selecting someone whose only experience really is having served as mayor of a small town of 9 000 and about one year in the governors office in alaska
9129604 john mccain has chosen wisely in selecting governor sarah palin as his running mate john mccain has again demonstrated his judgment and his commitment to conservative values fiscal discipline and reform
9129605 i had the opportunity to meet with gov sarah palin on my recent trip to anwr i found her to be very down to earth and personable she is a person who would feel at home in southern indiana she hunts and fishes and is pro life
9129606 sarah palins selection is an outstanding example of john mccains willingness to reach out to fresh voices embrace new leadership and continue the republican partys strong support of conservative women leaders
9129607 instead of choosing a running mate who has the experience to be a real partner in bringing change to this country john mccain made a political pick in an attempt to reverse the anxiety republicans are feeling about his campaign rather than reversing the anxiety working families have about their future and their childrens future
9129608 that is what we wanted to see that was the important thing
9129609 as i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i have no fear because i am the meanest motherf cker in the whole valley
9129610 up to now lord you had your gigantic sandle foot placed on the windpipe of all my dreams but even as you try to defeat me i hatch another idear to defeat you
9129611 obama will see a significant bump and we believe it is reasonable to expect nearly a 15 point bounce out of a convention in this political environment
9129612 if we have to choose between emotional repression and sexual repression then a better trade off seems to be fewer partners and more intimacy
9129613 save sex for marriage sex outside of marriage is empty and uses you up
9129614 women can save sex for marriage if they want and should not be looked down on for it and the same is true for men but neither must do it
9129615 there are we may say three conspicuous types of life the sensual the political and thirdly the life of thought now the mass of men present an absolutely slavish appearance choosing the life of brute beasts but they have grounds for so doing because so many persons in authority share the tastes of sardanapalus

9129628 the group 70 foundation fund is a donor advised fund at hawaii community foundation it is unique because it is funded by employee contributions so management steps back and employees select the organizations
9129629 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community

9129631 many of the employee donors even end up volunteering for the recipients id like to thank group 70 for its innovative approach to giving back to the community

9129659 microsoft has over 40 full time people invested in privacy and over 400 part time people google least from what i read about them evolved to that
9129660 we think about privacy as part of the core design we have thought about how to design privacy into the product as opposed to how to react to the negative impressions
9129661 so these are all images that anyone could go out and take with a camera we do take great care that if someone did feel their privacy was invaded there is a way that they can easily tell us about it and well remove it right away

9129756 your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus who being in very nature god did not consider equality with god something to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on a cross therefore god exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father

9129839 en chile no hay presos pol ticos las personas que est n privadas de libertad todas est n ah exclusivamente por resoluci n de los tribunales han tenido todas las garant as de un debido proceso
9129840 se alaba que las c rceles concesionadas visit santiago 1 y rancagua est n en la primera l nea de lo que l ha visto en el continente no solamente en sudam rica
9129841 no hay en ning n caso en chile pr ctica de torturas ni en ning n caso permisividad o complacencia o hacer la vista a un lado en caso de malos tratos si es necesario son investigados y sancionados si corresponde
9129842 is it against the law to drive on the road with mud tires
9129843 the brick walls are not there to keep us out the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something because the brick walls are there to stop the people who dont want it badly enough theyre there to stop the other people
9129844 its not about how to achieve your dreams its about how to lead your life
9129845 dana and the kids are still asleep so just skip the bedrooms
9129846 ok self this is awkward play dead yeah if you just play dead hell suddenly realize that hes walking all around a sleeping woman and beat a hasty retreat you can both pretend it never happened
9129847 are you freakin kidding me what in the world makes you think that this is ok
9129848 hey i just wanted to let you know that sam is here do you want to get up so he can spray this room
9129849 qui n te ha visto y qui n te ve
9129850 not only a companion but also a trustworthy guide an orientation and a reference point
9129851 the last stage of our life days to live are progressively growing fewer
9129852 en todo momento los carabineros preguntaban por armamento y el paradero de los pe i que est n requeridos por la justicia nuestros luchadores sociales mapuche se nos interroga por armas que jam s han encontrado ni jam s encontrar n porque no existen
9129853 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9129854 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9129855 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9129856 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9129857 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9129858 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9129859 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9129860 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
9129861 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
9129862 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
9129863 respecto de la nota sobre el accidente a reo de la empresa spanair en el aeropuerto de barajas difundida el pasado viernes tn todo noticias quiere se alar que la informaci n sobre el contenido de los ltimos di logos producidos en la cabina del avi n fu obtenida de dos fuentes militares que la ratificaron en los mismos t rminos la nota no incluy audio ni grabaci n alguna sino un di logo reconstru do por escrito a partir de las palabras textuales obtenidas de esas fuentes militares period sticamente chequeadas obviamente dicho di logo reconstru do con intervenci n t cnica no constituye prueba legal alguna no obstante contiene textuales de alto valor informativo lamentablemente por error se consign que se trataba de un di logo procedente de la caja negra del avi n cuando proven a de estas fuentes

9129865 this year was difficult because i couldnt really take tournaments off
9129866 i always had to chase the rhythm of playing on that particular surface that i was wanting to play on
9129867 i am concentrating on my own game and physically i am fine
9129868 i was struggling with that stroke but i managed to win at the end so that is the most important thing
9129869 i felt i had some chance but she had lots of heart
9129870 i was not too bad i tried to go to the volley and put pressure on her but i felt my serve was not good i double faulted too much
9129871 i have no idea how she played what the other girl did i have no idea i only heard it on the news
9129872 all of the theories are based on circumstantial evidence and a lot of supposition
9129873 thats why being another theory i dont think this is jack the ripper but it cant be ruled out
9129874 i dont know that digging up people on a speculative basis would be appropriate
9129875 it is possible we might still find out one day who jack the ripper was it is equally possible that no one will ever know
9129876 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
9129877 presente las debidas querellas criminales en contra del gremio de los camioneros de los ngeles y de la ix regi n por su participaci n en la apolog a a la violencia tales acciones criminales deben presentarse al m s breve plazo de lo contrario ser n las comunidades que concurrir n al tribunal
9129878 con frecuencia todos los hechos que suceden en el sur del pa s con absoluta ligereza e irresponsabilidad se las atribuyen a los mapuche esta situaci n reiterada obedece por un lado al racismo hist rico con los mapuche y por otro responde a los intereses de los grupos econ micos y particularmente por quienes han participado en actos de despojo territorial
9129879 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
9129880 esta situaci n se alan sucede porque carabineros act a bajo la doctrina del enemigo mapuche
9129881 considerando que carabineros al momento de los allanamientos atacan indiscriminadamente al conjunto de la comunidad
9129882 a ra z del descontrol y los ataques indiscriminados de carabineros en contra de los mapuche que result herido con balines el sargento edgardo alvarado esta situaci n desmiente la participaci n de los mapuche en actos de violencia
9129883 emplazamos al general de carabineros de la ix regi n a que informe objetivamente sobre el origen de los balines que afectan a su personal
9129884 muchos de ellos actores de la usurpaci n de tierras mapuche
9129885 quienes han venido haciendo apolog a publica sobre la violencia y amenazas reiteradas para el uso de las armas de fuego en contra de los comuneros mapuches
9129886 recordamos que los nicos que han tra do el terror la violencia el despojo de nuestras tierras y territorio han sido los grupos econ micos
9129887 ante el aumento del racismo odioso de los agricultores de las empresas forestales de los camioneros y la agitaci n de algunos parlamentarios
9129888 el conflicto no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9129889 el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas
9129890 la m s importante que haya habido en el pa s por cierto la m s sangrienta
9129891 de modo incomprensible el gobierno se demor m s de 90 d as en dar respuesta a la huelga de hambre de patricia troncoso que la prensa tambi n acall
9129892 no fue porque exista una conspiraci n del silencio lo que hay es una autorrepresi n psicol gica en la sociedad chilena frente al conflicto con el pueblo mapuche creemos que si no lo vemos desaparece
9129893 neruda sol a viajar desde temuco a puerto saavedra pues all un colono de apellido winter le prestaba libros en ese tiempo el poeta escribi sus primeras obras los borradores de los veinte poemas de amor pero en todos ellos no hay un solo indio neruda no los vio y eso que en puerto saavedra no hay m s que arena olas y mapuches
9129894 sacar el conflicto mapuche del mbito policial y reconocerle su condici n de problema pol tico
9129895 la clave del problema es que nos hemos negado a reconocerles su condici n de pueblo aceptaremos ahora que en el estado de chile puede coexistir m s de un pueblo
9129896 esta es una vieja historia cargada de decepci n y frustraciones
9129897 no hay museo m s chic en chile que el museo de arte precolombino
9129898 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina

9129900 nosotros reconocemos en los mapuches a nuestros ancestros pero andar pregonando que uno ha matado al padre es feo
9129901 si ese fondo no hubiera existido acota bengoa hoy el problema ser a inmanejable
9129902 este es un fen meno com n a am rica latina
9129903 el primer gran desaf o que enfrent la conadi fue pronunciarse respecto del proyecto de construcci n de la central hidroel ctrica ralco que requer a aprobar la permuta de terrenos ind genas como los delegados del presidente en dicha organizaci n votaron en contra frei los cambi as la conadi perdi su legitimidad cuando se estrenaba en sociedad
9129904 el informe qued archivado en alg n escritorio en la moneda de donde no volvi a salir
9129905 no les parec a que los delitos calificaran de terrorismo pero el gobierno insisti ante la corte suprema contratando los servicios de un prominente abogado amigo y profesor de los jueces que deb an resolver
9129906 y el tema desapareci de la agenda de gobierno esta administraci n nunca tuvo realmente una pol tica para enfrentar el conflicto mapuche
9129907 estamos dispuestos a aceptar al mapuche folcl rico aquel que baila con sus trajes t picos y es amable pero no al joven que se viste con chaqueta de cuero y que se nos para de igual a igual exigiendo respeto a sus derechos
9129908 pero se equivocaron quienes creyeron que este asistencialismo iba a desindigenizar a los j venes mapuches al contrario el acceso al conocimiento y a los derechos que hoy se les reconocen internacionalmente a los pueblos ind genas han alentado sus demandas
9129909 el gobierno se enfrenta hoy a una intifada mapuche y ya se dio cuenta de que el problema no se soluciona a palos ni regalando vaquitas pero es dif cil saber hasta d nde se va a llegar el problema de fondo sigue siendo el reconocimiento pol tico la existencia de un pueblo y el derecho a la tierra porque como ha demostrado el conflicto palestino israel no hay cultura sin territorio
9129910 is there already a good website out there that is addressing these readers
9129911 chile consagra formalmente una nueva mirada sobre la discapacidad que deber a contribuir a poner al d a nuestra legislaci n y nuestras pol ticas p blicas

9129914 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
9129915 si enfrentamos preventivamente las dificultades y las demandas que tienen las comunidades no s lo en temas de tierras sino que en temas de vivienda de agua de asistencia productiva vamos a estar disminuyendo tensiones
9129916 muy pocas han tenido alguna situaci n de conflicto en el pasado
9129917 hechos como el de este domingo el atentado en vilc n claramente est n absolutamente fuera del marco de trabajo en el cual la conadi est funcionando
9129918 no se ha registrado ratificaci n del convenio 169 por parte de chile en la oit chile no ha presentado los instrumentos de ratificaci n

9129924 en la octava y novena regi n son 1 500 comunidades mapuches
9129925 hay que mirarlo en su justa medida hay que darle la oportunidad a las polic as que trabajen tranquilas porque esta es una investigaci n de largo aliento no son investigaciones de un d a para otro para tener un resultado hay que tener paciencia
9129926 estamos tratando de obtener la mayor informaci n y yo he reforzado la cantidad de funcionarios para ver si podemos detener a las personas que corresponden de acuerdo a las instrucciones de los fiscales
9129927 llamamos al gobierno a promulgar y depositar el convenio 169 de la oit sobre pueblos ind genas el que fuera aprobado por el congreso en marzo pasado y permanece inexplicablemente en el escritorio de la presidenta esperando su firma ello a pesar de que el ejecutivo conoce los procedimientos que este convenio establece para la resoluci n de conflictos por tierras como los que afectan a la comunidad de temucuicui
9129928 all en per hay un mejor clima laboral y un mejor control contra la violencia le est haciendo muy mal a chile esta idea de que a trav s de la violencia y de la ilegalidad los grupos de presi n pueden satisfacer sus demandas
9129929 ya quisiera alg n partido u ong tener tanta influencia
9129930 los pueblos ind genas no se oponen al desarrollo sino que quieren ser incluidos en sus propios t rminos y esto no comprende el gobierno
9129931 que es mucho m s peligroso que los decretos 1015 y 1073 e hizo un llamado a las comunidades del pa s para continuar la lucha por la derogatoria de estos otros decretos
