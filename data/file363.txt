3630016 zaccheus was a wee little man and a wee little man was he he climbed up into a sycamore tree for the lord he wanted to see and as the wafer passed his way
3630017 i need to pray proactively not reactively prayer can change them as kids and individuals prayer can change me as a mom and as an individual prayer can change the relationship we have with each other
3630018 the only way my prayers mean anything is when they are backed with gods word i encourage you to find scriptures that are promises for you and your children pray them with the same consistency you speak your kids names focus on them not necessarily for hours at a time in your prayer closet but as a practiced lifestyle of belief
3630019 train a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not turn from it
3630020 lay down the law and impose your will while your kids are young and youre guaranteed to have kids who grow into adults just like you
3630021 set biblical and practical goals in parenting then develop an individualized training plan for each of your children that will help them reach those goals if you train your children in an individualized way then theyll reach the biblical and practical goals you set for them
3630022 each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others your attitude should be the same as christ jesus
3630023 the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective

3630025 and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host
3630026 but thou bethlehem ephratah out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel
3630027 and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger
3630028 he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david
3630029 behold there came wise men from the east asking where is the king of the jews
3630030 and when they had opened their treasurers they presented unto him gifts gold frankincense and myrrh
3630031 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life
3630032 the angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt for herod will seek the young child to destroy him
3630033 behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel
3630034 then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife
3630035 rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold the king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation
3630036 in this was manifested the love of god toward us because god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him
3630037 and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word
3630038 and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night
3630039 i am the alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last
3630040 i see him but not now i behold him but not near a star will come out of jacob a sceptre will rise out of israel
3630041 and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger
3630042 and you will have joy and gladness and many will rejoice at his birth
3630043 she will bring forth a son and you will call his name jesus for he will save his people from their sins
3630044 and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people
3630045 for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord
3630046 behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us
3630047 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace
3630048 god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and with power
3630049 for all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by us
3630050 and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of your house has eaten me up
3630051 our performance this year at the eisners is another indication of the level of talent now working with dark horse
3630052 it is particularly rewarding to see these committed creators who have invested so much of themselves into their work being recognized by our entire industry
3630053 does edwards suck yes but it is just one more reason to not vote for mccain

3630057 i thought the commonwealth bank result was pretty good especially in the context of a very difficult general operating environment with credit markets essentially malfunctioning for the better part of the reporting period
3630058 i dont know of too many banks around the world increasing their dividend at the moment
3630059 this allows wmt to focus on the quality projects within its portfolio whilst actively pursuing additional exploration opportunities as well as the acquisition of more advanced projects
3630060 we believe they need to come out of their partisan corners
3630061 we are going to have to see what the total package is
3630062 what the governor proposed i am not sure can be characterized as a tax increase
3630063 todays data indicates that wages inflation at relatively contained levels should not present an impediment to the rba as it begins to enter a rate cutting cycle
3630064 although inflation remains at high levels recent weakness in economic growth indicators has seen the rba shift its focus so that the growth outlook is now more concerning
3630065 its not an overly strong number and with employment growth slowing and general economic malaise you probably wouldnt expect acceleration from here
3630066 with the exception of one quarter annual growth has been between 4 0 and 4 2 per cent for the last three years and todays print is in line with recent history
3630067 while todays data may argue against a more aggressive 50 basis point cut in september a 25 basis point move looks likely

3630069 as we continue to execute on our strategy to expand our deepwater presence we again look forward to working with keppel fels on this important project our 3 1bn investment in the ensco 8500 series rigs demonstrates our commitment to playing a meaningful role in the growing deepwater market only two other companies will have ultra deepwater semisubmersible rig fleets equal to the size of the ensco fleet
3630070 the virtualbox kernel driver is not accessible to the current user make sure that the user has write permissions for dev vboxdrv by adding them to the vboxusers groups you will need to logout for the change to take effect
3630071 this is a recognition that our system will need to grow at a faster rate than even a generous and committed legislature can fund to produce the degrees arizona needs
3630072 do we have a model that increasingly restricts admission because of costs or do we have a higher rate of productivity that will bring down the cost of each degree
3630073 if we can do that without sacrificing quality we need to do it perhaps we can combine some departments and reduce administrative costs and still not lessen the quality of the product to the students
3630074 we graduate kids at ua at a rate of 5 7 years
3630075 if we can take that down by three or four or five tenths it doesnt cost us more money but well be graduating more in fewer years and your cost per pupil goes down
3630076 the good cause threshold you have to meet has gone up
3630077 the prior sheriff had more of a right to carry philosophy some of the things that were considered good cause wont be now
3630078 we dont see the numbers dropping to a few hundred but there will be some who dont apply and some who have their permits denied or revoked
3630079 to persons of good and upstanding character who possess credible significant and substantiated cause to fear for their safety

3630081 the applicant shall be scheduled for a personal interview with a department representative during this state there will be further discussion of the applicants statement of good cause
3630082 the sheriff may require that the applicant be referred to an authorized psychologist used by the department for psychological testing in order to determine the applicants suitability for carrying a concealed weapon
3630083 if it is determined that the applicant is not a suitable candidate for carrying a concealed weapon the applicant shall be removed from further consideration
3630084 once the sheriff or authorized designee has verified the successful completion of phase two the license to carry a concealed weapon will
3630085 if the licensee engages in any conduct which involves a lack of good moral character or might otherwise remove the good cause for the original issuance of the license
3630086 they can be sued if what they do results in harm or death to whom theyve disarmed

3630096 the accused pushed his hand into the hatch and she could see that his arm was rigid and he appeared to be unable to move it freely
3630097 the male stated he had a shotgun and wanted the carrier bag filled with money
3630098 i consider this to be a very serious offence which has had a very significant consequence for ms gray
3630099 while you didnt appear to have had any shotgun in your possession you pretended you did so and i think that makes it a very serious matter indeed
3630100 it seems to me that in these circumstances that there is no alternative but to a custodial sentence

3630134 i had kids working here and they had all sorts of problems with driving
3630135 they had these old cars theyd stuff with expensive gas but they would break down and theyd be late i had to find a solution
3630136 the electric bikes certainly are an advantage not having to be filled with gas and creating very little pollution
3630137 the university needs to do all it can to promote alternative methods of transportation and alleviate congestion this could definitely help

3630227 no company will be able to take the advantage of this fertiliser policy for next 6 12 months and the kind of market which we are seeing now whether it is the fertiliser or the sugar front there is no doubt that the long term story in both the sectors are intact or there is going to be quite positive in the time to come but nobody has that kind of vision if you really have a call of at least 12 months even on the fertiliser front as i said that even if somebody initiates the measures to revamp the capacity and take advantage of the extra production beyond rated capacity then also it will take at least 6 8 months what will happen the moment we will see the september quarter results or maybe the december quarter results which will broadly be on the lines of the previous quarters we all get disappointed these are more in the long run probably maybe a trading blip you may see upside in the next maybe couple of months but not on a long term sustainable basis
3630228 we need to understand what kind of policy measures are announced by the government now hereon because they all have exhausted they have made an announcement on the dap pricing they have made on the urea pricing they have made on single super phosphate ssp so now they are not left with any other products so what do they do now because now they are only left with this migration of the feedstock from naphtha to gas and the greenfield expansion policy so except we hear that all this things will take a very long time at least three four quarters so if you have that kind of a horizon definitely the sector is very positive but if you have a short term view maybe with a view to trade for next two three quarters probably i do not see any sharp improvement in the financials or the working of the companies in the next two three quarters

3630264 its sad to see a franchise that has had so much tradition and success just disappear as if it was some expansion team
3630265 to have that happen to a team like that with the tradition that seattle has its still strange to know that i wont go to seattle to play this season
3630266 its not right i think the city deserves a team
3630267 and i started thinking the move was going to happen when the team first was sold to an owner who wasnt from there i was hoping that it wouldnt but i felt like it would
3630268 i spent my whole career in seattle you know i just dont see that happening and thats fine with me
3630269 i dont think we want to come in there and try to just step over the sonics and what theyve done

3630284 i dont know what im going to do with it i just kind of fell into it i just enjoy learning about different societies
3630285 it was tough at first kind of just finding my niche finding a place where i belonged its been a long journey but im really really happy with where im at now its been a great experience

3630289 we couldnt wait to get into a game and get this thing started were so sick of practice
3630290 when we face the usa we have all kinds of problems

3630315 i heard choking was involved i hear hes got facial injuries he was getting beat up
3630316 we didnt call the police because there was a fight we called police because we just knew that it was different we were being cautious
3630317 we have almost no trouble at sturgis the people are so happy that you just learn to recognize when things seem a little different
3630318 there were probably 30 officers outside when it happened so the response was instantaneous
3630319 its difficult but people have to wait for all of the evidence to come in and the investigation is done and it will be obvious that he was defending himself
3630320 i didnt know until after the fact that their numbers are made up of police and firefighters
3630321 they were happy go lucky guys theyd been in there throughout the rally and just seemed like normal guys that ride motorcycles and were having a couple of beers and hanging out we didnt view them as any kind of outlaw motorcycle group we had not had any trouble with them whatsoever

3630346 some of us have heard from some principals who feel they can get more substantial results from within the building than from sending a large group to a national conference
3630347 it starts from finding your leaders in the community and building on that
3630348 thats why i offered to meet with them once i start
3630349 i am what dave refers to as a financial nerd and have been budgeting most of my adult life
3630350 however for my wife the budgeting process felt more like being controlled and it created a source of tension in our marriage
3630351 the course gave us the opportunity to be in a neutral environment and helped us create a common understanding of how to manage our money and communicate on the same level
3630352 the course taught me how to communicate with my wife without overwhelming her or making her feel controlled
3630353 we have been preyed upon by the credit industry and the marketing firms who have convinced us that we should buy now and pay later and that debt is an acceptable way of life
3630354 it is very disheartening to see the number of families who struggle financially because they have not learned how to manage their money
3630355 i want first lutheran to be a source of help for people who are hurting financially and offer some hope
3630356 my hope is that people will develop a good foundation of how to use their money rather than their money dominating them and become more motivated to share their resources with others
3630357 hopefully anyone who goes through this course will come away with a sense of being in control or that they have a plan in place
3630358 id like to see others find that financial peace that my family found
3630359 something is working in one and something is broken in the other
3630360 at some point some red flags should kind of go up
3630361 we might be expecting more from a pool that just is low in numbers
3630362 it may be that we need to take a close look at the staff and whether summit house can pare down its staff for the program
3630363 were not sure how to increase that number but we heard that we could maybe go and screen people in the jail throughout the year
3630364 well just get together and see how we can reach more
3630365 the board felt that he had done a really good job in all these areas

3630370 he dave set me up so it looked like we were back together i know he was behind it maybe it was just his attempt at getting back with me but that is never going to happen
3630371 if we have to scratch and run the bases were going to do it if we have to hit some pitches and drive them out of the batters box thats what well do
3630372 what i remember was how he treated me in my first at bat
3630373 he got me out with a cut fastball instead of making something happen i said im going to look for the cutter and try to pull the ball and try to get some lift on the ball
3630374 even though it wasnt as far in as the one he got me out on it was a pitch he wanted to throw more in but he missed i was able to connect
3630375 i threw him some good changeups the first at bat he must have been looking for that changeup
3630376 everything was working i just had that one bad inning and one bad pitch really
3630377 i think its all due to my legs my strength is back ive been taking care of my knee doing my exercises and getting the treatment that i need its taken a long time but im glad its to the point where i feel very strong with my back leg
3630378 im always upset at myself when the other team scores first because percentage wise it doesnt work your way
3630379 lately it doesnt matter what were doing out there theyre showing up offensively theyre more relaxed it looks like theyre having a lot of fun and enjoying themselves things tend to go your way when that happens
3630380 ive always said i admire and respect her jordan and i think shes done so well but there does come a time when someone says so much about you that you have to defend yourself
3630381 i read that shed said id never really look like her as her look is unique well id like to know when hair extensions fake t s and fake tan became unique because its every other girl on the street
3630382 the whole world doesnt revolve around her and she needs to realise that
3630383 our lives are so different shes a wife and a mother and im a young single girl

3630393 were not in banana country so i was really happy when this tree began producing bananas ive been able to grow a few bananas before but nothing like this
3630394 it was a story that took 86 years to tell
3630395 at the first sign of frost i asked the landscaper if he could keep it in the maintenance area for me and he was kind enough to do that so the tree would not freeze
3630396 already this tree has produced more bananas than i have ever seen grow in this area
3630397 a little tree begins to grow from the old trees roots
3630398 can you believe such a big tree grew in such a small pot this is a great example of nature at its best
3630399 once while i was riding on a crowded bus the man sitting next to me threw his cell phone out the window when his phone rang instead of dutifully answering it he casually tossed it away i was stunned he looked at me shrugged and looked away i had no idea if it was his if it was stolen or if he even knew what a cell phone was but in one seemingly careless motion he managed to liberate himself from something that has completely consumed me

3630405 rather than face interpersonal dealings head on we can hide behind our phones until we can talk at our convenience or not talk at all
3630406 the iphone has a new application a gps navigational system called loopt if youre out and about and you want to know if your friends are in the neighborhood your phone can tell them where you are and theirs tells you where they are youre in the loop with technology like this its a wonder anyone has affairs anymore total information constant contact anytime all the time theres almost literally nowhere left to hide

3630433 there are certainly some basics to consistently hitting a golf ball well but each player has to pick and choose what works for them
3630434 they key is to remember there really is no such thing as a perfect swing because no one swing works for everyone everybody is built and plays different tigers swing works for him obviously but its not maybe for the rest of us its all about finding whats right for you thats why were always changing things around a little
3630435 you have to be careful not to become too much a slave to the practice range and obsess over mechanics
3630436 otherwise you stop thinking about golf and the course you play it on

3630453 i heard kurt suzuki yell home and thank god jason bartlett stopped if not there would have been a collision and i think i would have been the one on the floor
3630454 we need to turn the page and to come here and beat tampa bay is a step in the right direction we didnt rip the cover off the ball but we got what we needed and gio pitched great for us
3630455 obviously the more time im there ill be better and feel more comfortable its a reaction position
3630456 i know and live the velvet revolver guys bit there is no truth in to the story about me joining their band
3630457 yo dudes i feel like a heffer i am going on a hunger strike
3630458 hmm i dont think i can play my usual games with this mom anymore
3630459 oh no no that isnt good you should do this instead
3630460 it is the beginning of a new era as the disability rights movement in himachal pradesh has started to yield results
3630461 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3630462 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3630463 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3630464 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3630465 we expect that proclamation of governor and vice governor will be sometime before 5 pm today all we are really doing right now is waiting for the last few reports to come in for us to meet the requirement for proclamation
3630466 milf negotiators are better because they are scholars and ideologues
3630467 we are no better negotiators than our counterparts in the government but what perhaps spells the difference is we stand for truth iqbal replied
3630468 it just happened that we in the milf are standing on solid historic moral grounds that are impossible to defeat in a fair and square deal
3630469 the voices of hatred and the ghosts of the moro spanish war still haunt them to this day
3630470 they are well grounded men and perhaps what differentiates our style from them is that even across the negotiating table we still follow the consultative and collective policy of the milf
3630471 our troops have virtually cleared all barangays villages affected while the group of umbra kato have left the clearing process including the removal of mines and explosives laid by the rebels as they left are still being conducted
3630472 what we are doing right now is mere procedural like mine clearing because the group of umbra kato had left many mines we are not yet recommending the return of the civilians because of possible mines
3630473 the areas where there were presence of milf rebels under ameril umbra are already cleared the ones that were left there are the milf members who are natives in the area they kato and his group are no longer there
3630474 they followed the resolution of the committee of the milf and the grp for them to reposition thats what happened
3630475 there will be four or five people singing with music about god
3630476 the concept of a beach convent is something that is appreciated by vacationers and the nuns themselves
3630477 the man who would cheat death amp rule the universe
3630478 the terra cotta army never went into battle and their emperor didnt conquer death and the afterlife nor did he succeed in ruling the universe or anything else lying buried and forgotten for more than two millennia his hollow and motionless army and servants are in fact mute testimony to the limits of human power and influence
3630479 the terra cotta army bears silent witness to one mans colossal yet vain endeavors to conquer death the first emperor of china failed like all others who have tried he did not become a god nor did he conquer death the afterlife or the universe
3630480 when i was an it support rep i used multiple ways of supporting my clients vnc rdp etc it was confusing and time intensive to keep up with all the logins and to support people through slow tools that were insecure bomgar is an awesome one stop tool that is super fast and easy to use for both the rep and the client and it solved my clients security issues
3630481 we see nothing but a bright future ahead with bomgar remote access software in place at our company the bomgar platform has enabled us to very easily take on the role of a virtual it department for many of our existing customers and we are able to leverage that service to other new prospects as well the productivity and efficiency gains that we have experienced with bomgar are paramount in todays fast paced help desk environment this puts us in an excellent position to continually expand our support service levels and offerings
3630482 my experiences with bomgar from hardware to software to sales to support has been outstanding it has dramatically simplified our remote access support protocol
3630483 our computer support contractor uses this remote access software and its truly revolutionary in the hands of the right practitioner i can be on the golf course on a saturday and let someone know that there is a problem they wont be in the office either but can often fix it from their own remote location within a matter of minutes all while not bringing our network security down
3630484 advancements in fabric technology have given this years olympic swimmers an advantage that they didnt have four years ago
3630485 technology keeps advancing and fashion will go hand in hand with competitive sports for as far as the future can see
3630486 they actually swim faster with these suits on than they would if they were naked
3630487 it seems unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3630488 this increases the risk of an avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3630489 many countries have succeeded in getting the virus under control but as long as avian influenza remains endemic in some countries the international community needs to be on alert
3630490 it is tough to say that i have a lot of pride
3630491 julian has a lot of pride he would never admit it but i think he would be wrong in not saying that there is not one thing hill cant do me and julian can do anything we are asked to do it wouldnt always be pretty but we could do it a lot of the stuff julian makes look easy leroy it just is easy you go coverage blitzing open field tackling he is just that good
3630492 when the time is right we will move forward with that
3630493 if they start talking i would love to be a seahawk if not i understand the business side of it too well see what happens
3630494 i know he is up for contract after this year
3630495 i would really love to have him around his attitude is great out there he is like a big kid he loves playing football and it shows i dont know where everybody gets this rap for being lazy but its because he makes it all look so easy
3630496 i think everybody brings a different thing to the table
3630497 i cant say there is one best everybody has an ability that they excel at thats what makes us a good group i bring the all around ness i can cover i can blitz i am the jack of all trades type of thing
3630498 im blessed to play with these guys and to learn from them
3630499 as far as the accolades and that point of view the other two get the recognition whatever

3630550 i would say 80 percent are pleasantly surprised how much they like the sardines when prepared well
3630551 bottomfeeder how to eat ethically in a world of vanishing seafood
3630552 we used to wait until 2 a m when the fishing boats would come in the sardines would be grilled right then on the beach with a bit of sea salt we would eat them on top of bread with olive oil and a glass of wine
3630553 customers who like a stronger fish really like the sardines
3630554 i have to do the cheesecake or some variation of it
3630555 its one of those things that people come for that you always have to have
3630556 i want everything on the menu to be a signature dish i have to believe it is all of that quality
3630557 but there are certain things the customers expect you can suggest the specials maybe the lobster ravioli or the lamb chops i love them all but they come back to the ossobuco al bosco
3630558 even if you dont intend for it to be your signature it can turn out that way if the customers love it and expect it from you
3630559 i wanted to do something a little different and the small plate concept really appealed to me
3630560 i think people have gotten away from the big entree i noticed so many people ordering off the appetizer menu i decided to focus on a selection of small entrees people could share
3630561 nothing fancy just five ingredients but its the one thing always in my repertoire even my mom has to have it and i would make anything on the menu for her
3630562 over the top is how i would describe its popularity
3630563 you can only get it on monday for a reason it develops a following it brings people in who might not otherwise check us out and my hope is that their eye goes to other parts of the menu and they see something else they want to try its a no brainer if its good they will come
3630564 it is a good thing and bad thing to be known for something
3630565 but we prided ourselves on being as organic as possible and serving things that were as fresh as possible and natural the jar was a way to showcase what we were doing once it caught on i had to have it
3630566 and probably some cheesecake in fact i may just have the cheesecake
3630567 i may change it a little but it still has to taste the same
3630568 about 11am aest one of the aircraft pilots declared an aircraft emergency and diverted to coffs harbour airport to land he said
3630569 one hawk landed safely at 11 40am and the other has returned to williamtown near newcastle
3630570 the aircraft was circling over the ocean to receive a standard damage check from the other hawk pilot the spokesman said
3630571 while circulating the aircraft was also burning off fuel to reduce its landing weight
3630572 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3630573 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3630574 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3630575 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3630576 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3630577 the more the chinese become dependent on the rest of the world the more the rest of the world has influence

3630605 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3630606 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3630607 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3630608 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3630609 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3630610 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3630611 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3630612 the tibetan protesters were in the park john ray was running behind them the police was running behind him
3630613 we always had security arrangements in place even before they could fully start the demonstration we had them under control
3630614 this is a recognition that our system will need to grow at a faster rate than even a generous and committed legislature can fund to produce the degrees arizona needs
3630615 do we have a model that increasingly restricts admission because of costs or do we have a higher rate of productivity that will bring down the cost of each degree
3630616 if we can do that without sacrificing quality we need to do it perhaps we can combine some departments and reduce administrative costs and still not lessen the quality of the product to the students
3630617 we graduate kids at ua at a rate of 5 7 years
3630618 if we can take that down by three or four or five tenths it doesnt cost us more money but well be graduating more in fewer years and your cost per pupil goes down
3630619 if the rider pedals the bike can go for 35 miles
3630620 the batteries recharge in about 3 1 2 hours and plug into any electrical outlet
3630621 depending on lease length and which bike it can cost anywhere from 20 to 50 a month
3630622 i had kids working here and they had all sorts of problems with driving
3630623 they had these old cars theyd stuff with expensive gas but they would break down and theyd be late i had to find a solution
3630624 the electric bikes certainly are an advantage not having to be filled with gas and creating very little pollution
3630625 the university needs to do all it can to promote alternative methods of transportation and alleviate congestion this could definitely help
3630626 i think we need a solution to global warming but even if you believe that global warming is a big myth everybody can look at the gas pump and see the benefits
3630627 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party

3630629 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat

3630656 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3630657 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3630658 small businesses are the engine of this community they should be helping us
3630659 weve started a process that quite frankly i dont think will ever end
3630660 what we are creating is an approach and a willingness to constantly revisit these issues to create a more business friendly climate
3630661 the bakery was here for 15 years and the fridge about 10 years
3630662 i need it to be profitable i was just so disappointed with the process
3630663 our experience once it was explained to us though was good
3630664 we are under the impression they are working with zoning
3630665 we wouldnt necessarily check with other departments were not that regulatory
3630666 im very proud to be an olympian now officially but were kind of putting that part of it behind us were here to get on the podium were here to win and to give our best performance were not happy with just being here
3630667 we face all of these teams that were going to play here we can play at that level we know we belong at this level and we want to perform a 1 1 draw is a point but we are disappointed we didnt put our best performance out there
3630668 we start at a younger age in that area its a little more well known when kids are growing up as opposed to soccer in other areas
3630669 were making leaps and bounds as far as our skill level goes
3630670 these young kids are the ones who are holding the standard for the group theyre kind of pushing us older kids
3630671 to have us back in the games as a female sport is phenomenal
3630672 thats something were proud of to have our young futures kids able to watch us on tv and see us in the media and be able to have those aspirations we did as kids watching the mary lou rettons of the world
3630673 we could go shopping or catch a movie or or something somewhere but not here
3630674 theres nothing wrong with trying out new things once in a while besides reinas paying
3630675 you need a little excitement in your life i promise youll be thanking us for bringing you here before the night is over
3630676 yeah itll be fun come on the host is right ahead
3630677 i think this is a mistake we could get into real trouble
3630678 the only trouble we might get into is if reinas dad found out we were patronizing a place other than one of those her family owns
3630679 ill just tell daddy i was checking out the competition
3630680 getting into an upright position when she saw reina pouring assiduously over the menu the dark haired maiden asked in a low voice
3630681 are you two done with that yet im feeling a little hungry i guess i could do with some food
3630682 oh my god eri i knew you were innocent but this this is too much
3630683 eririn the menu is for picking out who you want to accompany you for the night for example if you happened to take a fancy to the host who showed us in you could pick him he was rather cute that chinese accent was kinda sexy
3630684 accompany me why would i want to be accompanied wait dont tell me this is what i think it is
3630685 bingo this is a host club host clubs have been around for more than four decades the first one reportedly opened in tokyo in 1966
3630686 dont worry so much were here to enjoy ourselves so forget about everything else
3630687 from my observation shes a feisty one she could probably hold down some hard liquor but wheres the fun in getting her smashed too quickly ill start her off with red wine
3630688 i dont want her to get a hangover the next day i can tell shes a newbie
3630689 always looking out for the customers at your own expense no wonder you and your sis lead such hard lives
3630690 i dont have to answer your question and i wasnt the one who chose you
3630691 i dont have to answer your question and i wasnt the one who chose you

3630693 what do you think about this dress or this skirt would it match what i already have
3630694 would i end up looking like a walking tomato if i wore this with that red top i like so much

3630761 i think the two strikers are top class and on the same level as anyone
3630762 if they play together a lot i think they can go on and get better and better
3630763 if you ask me i would prefer them to have played together more in pre season but torres came back late and we only signed keane recently so it wasnt ideal
3630764 both players are clever and it is clear that if they play together for a long time it will be easier for them to develop an understanding i think they will be okay and can show their quality

3630766 oh you like to watch that listen to that because its them or him
3630767 i know that i said on my first day that i did not count on him but i also said that i would treat him like any other player
3630768 his behaviour and attitude in scotland and the united states have made me decide that he will remain with us as well as that he is a player with immense talent
3630769 the negotiations to sign a number nine were stopped some weeks ago following a decision by me and sporting director txiki begiristain

3630789 we had a very good dialogue i was able to get a sense of his soul
3630790 youre doing a great job hang in there well get through this
3630791 we dont need a nip and a tuck we need a plan
3630792 the 20th century did not witness a growth of morality in mankind
3630793 exterminations on the other hand were carried out on an unprecedented scale culture declined sharply the human spirit waned so what reasons have we to expect that the 21st century one bristling with first class weaponry on all sides will be kinder to us
3630794 did he come here with a message did he see something that many of us are missing in that case the tragedy is ours
3630795 muslim americans are a highly diverse population one largely comprised of immigrants
3630796 nonetheless they are decidedly american in their outlook values and attitudes overwhelmingly they believe that hard work pays off in this society
3630797 the survey shows that although many muslims are relative newcomers to the u s they are highly assimilated into american society
3630798 with the exception of very recent immigrants most report that a large proportion of their closest friends are non muslim and by nearly 2 to 1 63 percent 32 percent muslim americans do not see a conflict between being a devout muslim and living in a modern society
3630799 very few muslim americans just 1 percent say that suicide bombings against civilian targets are often justified to defend islam an additional 7 percent say suicide bombings are sometimes justified in these circumstances
3630800 overall just 5 percent of muslim americans express even somewhat favorable opinions of al qaeda
3630801 while 73 percent say they have never experienced discrimination while living in this country
3630802 when asked about their general outlook on politics 38 percent of muslim americans describe their political views as moderate a quarter describe themselves as liberal while 19 percent describe themselves as conservative
3630803 muslim americans hold liberal political views on questions about the size and scope of government
3630804 at the same time however they are socially conservative and supportive of a strong role for government in protecting morality
3630805 the nice thing about seeing fred bat at six is that it gives us balance and lets us put out the attack we put out in the last test
3630806 watching the bowling attack with the four seamers it gave us lots of options to maintain pressure for longer and thats really promising
3630807 fred looks in good nick to me hes played well at six before so theres no reason at all why he cant play well at six again
3630808 when were looking at the side for india which may have two spinners we need to get the balance right between getting runs and taking wickets
3630809 on this showing at the oval it allows you to pressure the batters for longer which had quite a big influence on the game
3630810 if he gets through the rest of the season with durham well see where we are to build him up for that test match series
3630811 erste indikatoren f r den winter 2008 09 und sommer 2009 lassen eine bessere gesch ftsentwicklung als im vorjahr erwarten

3630813 we are delighted to welcome salim hassan macki to the board of heritage he is an outstanding addition he brings considerable oil and gas as well as corporate experience and an extensive network of contacts in the middle east and throughout the world his knowledge will be an invaluable addition to our board as heritage continues to expand its business in its core areas of the middle east africa and russia
3630814 ten people were killed and 24 were injured in the bombing
3630815 we havent done it since spring we started this morning in walk through today on the field was the first time well get better at it
3630816 sandys a good football player and hes had a pretty good camp too
3630817 and we put the dbs who are our best blitzers number one and our best cover guys at the outside backer nickel and dime positions
3630818 hes going through a time right now in his life that would be rough for anybody hell be back
3630819 we took him to the rice game and he had no idea i was going to put him on the field to play him he was extremely excited he did not want to redshirt i know that
3630820 overwhelmed with excitement ready to prove that i was ready to play
3630821 the thing i like about him is he gets downhill hard
3630822 hes not going to be a flashy guy where hes going to make a bunch of jukes and stuff he runs physical he runs extremely hard he makes plays just by being powerful
3630823 being with my teammates being around each other is really the most important thrill of all
3630824 just being around each other period thats bigger than anything
3630825 crawford as far as stepping in as a true freshman he did a very good job
3630826 its a hard offense to step in and pick up and learn things as quickly as he did he did a great job
3630827 we didnt have a lot of time to work on stuff before he got in there and started playing
3630828 so he kind of had to learn a lot of it on the fly last year and he did a great job with it
3630829 we are excited at the prospects of this partnership there will be plans to bring padu mobile to the middle east as both of us already have a presence there and an established foothold in our respective competencies
3630830 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3630831 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3630832 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3630833 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3630834 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3630835 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3630836 the position i finished in is well above the position i am in the world
3630837 unfortunately the chinese shooter was in front of me so i had to wait every time after he shot before the noise died down
3630838 i am not using this as an excuse but i dont have much opportunity to practice in front of a crowd of 10 000
3630839 but i have learnt a lot today it proves you can teach an old dog new tricks
3630840 i looked the man former russian president and now prime minister vladimir putin in the eye and i was able to get a sense of his soul
3630841 the conservatives dalliance with liberalism is as dead as a dodo
3630842 in the last few weeks senior tories have promised tougher bail conditions automatic jail for knife carriers and more prisons now they want automatic police use of covert video and listening devices regardless of the seriousness of the suspected crime
3630843 this would turn into as much of a snoopers charter as local councils surveillance powers for dog mess we need to roll back the surveillance state not give it new powers
3630844 we initially tried to eliminate these errors manually using spreadsheets
3630845 it was soon apparent that this was unworkable especially when we published the data on our website for feedback from residents we reviewed a number of gazetteer management solutions and ggp ngz was simply the best product for our needs
3630846 ggp ngz is easy to use for the ongoing maintenance of the gazetteer and possibly of greater importance easy to integrate with other systems and services
3630847 this supports a wide range of council business functions and underpins improved processes customer services and operational efficiencies
3630848 todays most pressing issues of social and economic development require more than traditional philanthropy
3630849 our agreement with microsoft today marks a joint long term commitment to help the most vulnerable in society with the most innovative appropriate solutions and technologies at our disposal
3630850 if we are to meet our goal of reaching the next 5 billion people around the world who are not yet realizing the benefits of technology it is critical that we look at innovative partners which span communities and geographies
3630851 we are thrilled that the aga khan foundation u s a will work with the unlimited potential group to help address the needs of the marginalized urban and rural communities in africa south and central asia
3630852 public services continue to be transformed by technology improving delivery on the front line and making us more effcicient behind the scenes unfortunately some people seem to take pleasure in knocking public sector projects that involve technology which is why id enourage anyone with a success story to share it with the wider world by entering these awards i know the nominations will all be of the highest standard so im really looking forward to seeing all the winners in january
3630853 in my role i get to see how technology is being used in innovative ways to transform public services be it a small project that is helping a local community or a large scale project that is benefiting millions of people across the country we need to get better at sharing and learning from our successes the e government national awards give us an excellent opportunity to do this so i would encourage you to submit your nominations
3630854 the awards are a yardstick for uk excellence in innovative government services including those enabling local communities to transact with their councils national online government services for citizens or businesses specific services for vertical industry sectors and government services delivered online through intermediaries and the voluntary sector
3630855 kpmg is proud to be lead sponsor of the awards for the fourth year running for us this is a way of recognising and celebrating all the good work thats been done i have no doubt that the standard of entries will once again be high and judging will be difficult
3630856 we believe that e government has helped to transform public services in this country it has made them more open more accessible and more efficient a key theme of this years awards are government services which help build a fairer more inclusive society e government gives all citizens and businesses the opportunity to interact directly with services and government which is why we think e government is helping to build a fairer society
3630857 im going to pick up a test on my way home and stop worrying myself sick over nothing
3630858 were excited about it its going to prompt some changes but well cross those bridges when we come to them
3630859 yeah its happening but its not like it is happening in shanghai so it is life as usual here with the exception of every public television screen is pretty much guaranteed to have it on
3630860 though i was invited to see the boxing matches there my logical side kicked in this country is already overpopulated as is olympics is in invitation to overpopulation to the infinity exponent i dont do crowds nor drama

3630901 maureen we need to talk youre a talented writer youve had a good career but its time for you to face it somethings wrong youre obsessing about things in a thoroughly weird way whats worse youre writing it down twice a week or so and publishing it in the new york times youre embarrassing yourself youre embarrassing the entire journalism profession of the world and youre creeping out everyone who reads your column who doesnt share your strangely warped attitudes about sex and gender

3630916 usually i have to keep them pent up inside the house its nice to have a playground like this where the children can play somewhat at peace but its obviously not a solution to living with the rocket fire
3630917 i just want the rockets to stop for good so that we dont have to live for these little moments of quiet that are followed by terrible barrages of qassams
3630918 the cease fire is giving families especially parents and kids a chance to breathe a little

3630922 its going to be a good business for the town
3630923 we cant take the chance of making a mistake when theres a death involved

3630929 the students have undertaken fundraising have planned a permanent memorial and will contribute to the catering for the after service function on friday

3631114 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3631115 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3631116 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3631117 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3631118 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3631119 small groups can cause horror to the us and jews alike

3631121 i dont even know why my client is wearing the thing on his head
3631122 to me its odd to him it is perfectly normal
3631123 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3631124 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3631134 either of these things alone would be straightforward to do but both together was far trickier than i thought nobody had done this with the runescape engine before
3631135 when i took the prototype to graphics i realised i should have taken it to
3631136 there were some fairly large technical discussions at this point
3631137 the engine is changing every month in small ways giving developers more flexibility
3631138 i started with the colours as the implings are very small creatures and had to be recognisable from far away the fashionable implings eclectic and magpie were very near thematically so to differentiate the eclectic impling it was given a stronger colour and extra features like the feather
3631139 its important to provide music that is dynamic and that responds to what players are doing in the game
3631140 mod chihiro had suggested something small thinking through items made of the other standard metals you cant get much smaller than arrowtips
3631141 one of the things the content needed was for the rarest implings to have high end drops to give top end players as much reason to play this minigame as the lower levelled players
3631142 looking for something for a high end reward my thought turned fairly quickly to the dragon items adding items to the dragon set always increases their desirability and they were of the right sort of level for this feature mod chihiro had suggested something small thinking through items made of the other standard metals you cant get much smaller than arrowtips
3631143 we have an homogeneous approach to design bouncing ideas off other developers talking through briefs with each other we have lots of thoughts at the back of our heads but tend to wait for a good opportunity to release them such as with the dark bows and dragon arrows
3631144 having implings carrying a huge bow was not in keeping with the flavour of the content
3631145 mod mark asked for a high end bow and a dark beast drop
3631146 the dark bow took a lot longer than it might seem
3631147 what with all the layers of complexity within the combat code once the coding was done and the numbers were right i spent the same effort again on getting the feel of the bow right the audio team put the finishing touches to the bow the icing on the cake
3631148 upon release the code is exposed to thousands of players doing odd combinations of things that are unforeseeable
3631149 at an early stage in the project when the rare implings were still a nightmare to find another mod was running through a random area when out of the blue i just heard them yelp what the heck oooh a ninja impling and we promptly ran around trying to catch it
3631150 the name of the minigame alone was hard to translate as it is an alliteration and has the word imp in both words of the title this was impossible to adapt because the german word for imp kobold isnt part of another word
3631151 we had to hold a meeting about this translation and decided on feebold a funny and nice name
3631152 release day is always adrenalin filled always fun and frantic and stressful we get to go in game hype it up a bit laughs and see our content live hundreds of people playing it asking each other questions asking me questions
3631153 its a nice feeling especially if players like it its the buzz the reward at the end of the hard work
3631154 terrified about the release well spend all day waiting for bug reports to come in and reading the forums everyone in forums religiously for feedback
3631155 it should be a success but you can never tell
3631156 it can sometimes take a while to get it right
3631157 if one player spots a dragon impling but doesnt have the hunter level to catch it they could contact their friend who does then they could follow the dragon impling until their friend arrives and catches it if that happens just once ill be very happy
3631158 ninja and dragon just cos theyre cool its hard to see that they look cool as they are so small but they do look cool if this were
3631159 previously we set a cap of five hundred polygons per model now your basic human npc still has that many but we can use up to around 2 000 2 500 for the larger models
3631160 we were also limited a little by the animation tools though now the tools team have produced more feature filled tools weve been able to increase polygon counts and create smoother animations
3631161 previously we set a cap of 500 polygons per model now we can use up to around 2 000 2 500 for the larger models
3631162 the interesting part was when it came to the legends quest npcs san tojalon irvig senay and ranalph devere who when they were originally designed we didnt have the ability to make them unique we do now
3631163 so after chatting with mod damian decided to go to town with them and they look amazing although we could have waited until the quest rework its easier to do all the npcs in one go because of the way we design them
3631164 ive really enjoyed the project especially when given complete freedom
3631165 i sometimes act out the animations myself to get a feel for them and i have a mirror on my desk for facial expressions
3631166 i had to animate a character carrying some heavy planks so walked around the office carrying one of the water cooler refills the other animators laughed at me laughs
3631167 most of the code for simple model updates already exists my job is simply to check that the new models work with the old code
3631168 seeing the old animations on the new model with her legs freaking out all over the place was quite amusing
3631169 there are near to one hundred different variations of zombies in the game now
3631170 the improvements add a little bit more variety and flair to the game especially the more individual monsters such as the werewolf agility course instructor
3631171 the zombies are my favourite i love the genre though so i might be biased there are near to one hundred different variations of zombies in the game now
3631172 its an exciting time to be working on the graphics team and being a part of making things look and act more realistically
3631173 music gives a soul to the universe wings to the mind flight to the imagination and life to everything
3631174 when i started i basically just had to write lots of songs now i run the team
3631175 although physically were separated from the rest of the company
3631176 in spirit and in practise were very much an integral part of the development process and of the complete runescape experience
3631177 the music is usually then created when an areas 3d models are complete and the sound effects when the animation is finished
3631178 the inspiration for songs and effects largely comes from seeing the areas and animations themselves once graphics have modelled them
3631179 some developers are very specific about what they want referencing certain themes while others give us free reign to do whatever we feel is appropriate both situations have their advantages
3631180 saxophones have a cheeky raspy noise that reflects the goblins they represent
3631181 over time weve established various instruments used to reflect certain runescape races for example saxophones have a cheeky raspy noise that reflects the goblins they represent
3631182 we use a commercial midi sequencing program that allows us to record a sixteen track song which we hand write using a midi keyboard controller
3631183 the loop editor is for taking the original full quality sound samples and creating small compressed loops from them these loops are then passed into a patch editor which allows us to arrange these loops onto our midi keyboards to play as an instrument to compose the songs how we want
3631184 one of the advantages is that rather than each player hearing a bank of sounds generated by their soundcard which might be different between each player they now hear the jagex sound bank so the music will sound the same across all computers and internet browsers
3631185 the sound bank could actually be compressed to pretty much fit on a single 1 44mb floppy disk
3631186 its a major technical and creative challenge working towards these tiny file sizes without creating a lot of audio noise we have to use lots of hiding masking and noise reduction techniques
3631187 the sound bank could actually be compressed to pretty much fit on a single 1 44mb floppy disk
3631188 as new facilities become available to us we use them
3631189 while we realise that not everyone may be interested in audio updates we as a company always have to bear in mind that its a complete gaming experience that we want to offer and that includes updates to every aspect of the game whether that be graphics storylines sound effects or even the website
3631190 saying that we aim to give players a high degree of control over the audio in the game to cater to as many tastes as possible
3631191 a good example of which is the option to turn music area sounds and sound effects on and off separately so if players want to listen to their own music but still hear sound effects they can
3631192 for as many players that turn the music off theres the same amount that turn it on and have the desire to green light unlock all of the songs in the song list
3631193 yes i like the darker songs in the game dramatic stuff fighting music etc songs that make you feel like youre on an adventure my favourites are
3631194 yeah i like the darker music too such as mod dan a s undead dungeon but also the more melancholy themes and ballads like forums for players comments and are always interested in what their favourites are
3631195 its true to say that our opinions regarding older content have changed dramatically over the years
3631196 were not daft enough to assume that we get things perfect with every update we will continue making improvements indefinitely
3631197 we take a fresh look at our development aims every 3 6 months
3631198 also the technologies available to us are far greater now as are our resources we now have a team big enough to look at these sorts of improvements as well as maintaining a healthy update schedule
3631199 we take a fresh look at our development aims every 3 6 months in the latest review we decided that our aims as a company and for runescape should involve a greater level of communication with our players
3631200 we have built up a massive list of possible improvements based upon ideas collected from the
3631201 with the shop rework it was simply an issue of us recognising that the shops did not work in the way that we wanted them to and deciding how to change them so they did
3631202 i was given the concept reasons and aims of the project one tab for infinite stock and one tab for player stock and went about writing the specifics of my brief from there
3631203 the way the change was made in some ways was the only way it could have been made
3631204 after the brief was finalised i created mock ups of the shop interface which allowed me to visualise how it needed to work from a technical viewpoint
3631205 there were 362 calls to the shop code 298 of them for unique shops
3631206 one of the difficult parts of this update was finding all of the different shops in the code
3631207 i also had to figure out a way to change all the shops in the game at the same time without breaking things as that would have affected other developers
3631208 in moving from the old code for shops to the new way shops work i wanted to write just one piece of script that would work for all shops so it would work more efficiently and be easier to change in future if we ever needed to
3631209 while the shop rework was a relatively small project for me to develop its the sort of thing that requires a huge amount of input from the mod tim
3631210 mod tim had done a search through the code but we had to go through them all to see which ones were duplicates what the shops were called note where they were in the code any requirements to use them there were 362 calls to the shop code 298 of them for unique shops
3631211 we then checked any stock in those shops that would cause problems for the economy if they were made available in infinite quantities and researched what the prices should be for the rest one of the main things was runes runes had to be infinite but priced sensibly so we didnt destroy runecrafting or detriment merchants
3631212 i found things like buying items faster than the server could handle problems with buying stackable items with a full inventory issues with the decreasing sale price when selling masses of items at once
3631213 it was quite daunting to begin with just because of the sheer magnitude all those shops and items and the importance in needing to get it right it took a long time but we did it
3631214 the shop rework is a good example of where an old piece of content has been superseded and is no longer suitable
3631215 a small number of players would stay at shops for a long time just buying goods which they would then sell on to other players for a profit
3631216 collecting goods using skills can take time so shops were originally intended as a quick but expensive alternative but it has in fact become a slow expensive alternative in some cases say when a shops entire stock has already been bought out
3631217 there will be some players that feel the shop rework update is just us wanting to take away their source of gold pieces however it is simply that shops were not filling their intended role in the game the average player should not be greatly affected by this update
3631218 there has been a significant increase in the amount of real world trading this year if we dont find a solution to rwt now it will ruin runescape
3631219 thats the case with all cheating whether its buying gold or cheating your way through a console game its fun for a while but the challenge goes and things quickly get boring
3631220 real world traders believe they are running legitimate businesses in some cases though its essentially organised crime
3631221 the first bots in runescape were identified by us within a few months of the games release
3631222 we dealt with them the best way we could at that time by changing the game so they were no longer able to function
3631223 we keep developing technologies to combat bots but its like an arms race we stop bots they improve their macros we stop them they improve again
3631224 if we dont break that vicious cycle now it would just keep getting worse and worse it could reach a point where macro software becomes undetectable
3631225 all customer support teams combined were banning tens of thousands of accounts each week that belong to real world traders most of these are bots but we also secure many accounts that real world traders have stolen and return them to their rightful owners
3631226 the player and forum moderators and other legitimate players have put in a lot of effort and deserve recognition
3631227 for a long time players have thought were not doing anything as they dont see everything we do weve been working on this problem every single day
3631228 we still regularly go bot busting though so players can see we are doing something
3631229 we have automatic and manual systems in place to identify bots but limited resources to deal with them it isnt possible to find and ban every single one
3631230 the player and forum moderators and other legitimate players have put in a lot of effort and deserve recognition they see more than we ever could so we follow up on as many abuse reports as possible
3631231 every time we double our efforts gold sellers quadruple theirs we cant continue only using our current methods throwing more and more resources at it
3631232 weve seen other mmogs take that route and it works but only to a limited extent some players would sell gold through their own website to avoid paying the developer a cut worse than that the demand for gold was still mostly being met by players using bots and scams ruining the experience for legitimate players
3631233 it would be very difficult to find a way of allowing players to buy runescape items for real money that doesnt cheapen the game
3631234 we looked at any number of different possible solutions weve read independent studies and spoken with other people in the mmog industry ultimately the consensus is that the only way to remove the real world trading market is to develop your game so you cannot make unbalanced trades
3631235 the key phrase is not profitable were changing our game in a way that doesnt negatively affect its gameplay but which makes real world trading not worth the effort
3631236 deciding to remove unbalanced trade was not an overnight decision we started working on it in 2006
3631237 i could have removed unbalanced trade at any time its just a few lines of code
3631238 the easy thing would have been to say right lets leave the wilderness as it is you just cant pick up other players drops instead of just removing things weve looked to replace them with something equivalent or indeed better
3631239 weve felt for a long time that some of this content needed changing anyway especially the wilderness so this was a good opportunity for us to make it work better more fun for our players and closer to our original intentions
3631240 we know its going to be a bumpy ride but in the long term runescape is going to be better for it
3631241 we know its going to be a bumpy ride but runescape is going to be better for it
3631242 above all were a games company we dont want to spend all our time and energy fighting gold sellers and bots we want to get on with making the game
3631243 we wrote that bts to suggest some of the things we wanted to do which we now could with the new runescape engine rs2 to encourage players to move over from runescape classic
3631244 theyre big projects and previously we couldnt work on many at the same time some were a little on the optimistic side laughs summoning was being talked about by players even before that bts though and we agreed it was a cool idea so we had to do it
3631245 player owned shops are the only thing that isnt currently possible but weve made the grand exchange which is close in concept and awesome in its own right were making advances in technology all the time so player owned shops might be possible in the future the other things are still on the cards in the distant future
3631246 the thing is no one knows how long a runescape year is were still in year 169 of the 5th age
3631247 we actually made the life rune for classic but didnt release it some players discovered its existence but there was no way to actually get it
3631248 initially we were considering summoning as an addition to magic we actually made the life rune for classic but didnt release it some players discovered its existence but there was no way to actually get it
3631249 at that point magic was already filling out and we were also concepting alternate spellbooks so decided it would be better as a new skill rather than an addition to an older one
3631250 thats when ideas like the beasts of burden came in it was at this point that the skill name changed to animal lore
3631251 we were also thinking animal lore would be to mining
3631252 we were however keen on not wanting to turn the game into petscape
3631253 summoning is the skill our players are expecting theyd be disappointed if we released a summoning skill but didnt call it that
3631254 it had returned to something that allowed us to rename the skill as summoning besides summoning is the skill our players are expecting theyd be pretty disappointed if we released a summoning skill but didnt call it that
3631255 plus thered be those still asking when we are going to release summoning even though we just had
3631256 i cant draw for toffee so id usually give graphics a short description and say go for it they really outdid themselves
3631257 with something as big as a skill you dont just want to make it look good you want to push the boundaries
3631258 we avoided making larger familiars for summoning at first because they would often become stuck while trying to fit through small gaps if we stuck with regular movement wed have limited what we could do with the skill and we wouldnt have been able to create the huge npcs we now have in production
3631259 its difficult when we cant tell players all the reasons we make a change particularly if its not well received we always want to be open with the players but at the same time we have to ensure we arent spoiling our plans for future content
3631260 but we have to act things out i had great fun doing the facial expressions of the pet monkey chat heads i looked at lots of videos of monkeys and mimicked their expressions into a mirror on my desk
3631261 my favourite familiar is the karamthulhu its just so amusing this evil squid in a fishbowl attacking your enemies
3631262 for a quest npc theres no problem with chat because youve got the topic of the quest to talk about
3631263 mod wilson had done an incredible job coming up with so much unique dialogue
3631264 after being used to writing character chat for postbag from the hedge it was a great change of pace for our team to be writing in game dialogue
3631265 thats easy my favourite familiar is the karamthulhu its just so amusing this evil squid in a fishbowl attacking your enemies
3631266 when we initially concepted the bird nests they were designed to add some variety to woodcutting similar to getting gems in mining the main aim was to add the tree seeds but we also wanted to add other aspects like shiny jewellery that a magpie may have stolen or even an egg that a bird may have laid at that point back in the concept phase of the farming skill we knew that these special eggs would need to be used as part of the summoning skill so although the skill went through a variety of different designs and focuses the decision to add eggs in the skill was actually made almost three years ago
3631267 the scripting has gone smoothly but most players are going to be more interested in how the skill looks and the visuals are brilliant the people that stick with the skill are going to get vast rewards
3631268 for small updates it makes sense to only test them after theyve been developed but skills are large and have a huge impact on the game we were involved from the very beginning giving feedback on the skills concept how it would work with the current game and with future planned content
3631269 one of the guys discovered a bug where you could obtain multiple familiars at the same time he had an army of about thirty of them following him around attacking everything his character attacked
3631270 summoning gives you the potential to be more powerful in combat so its only right that it contributes to your combat level which is a guide to your characters overall combat ability
3631271 if by the end of the wolf whistle quest you understand how summoning functions then weve succeeded the fact that it was developed by an excellent quest writer helps
3631272 you need some skills to be easy to train and some that are hard
3631273 if players dont understand something straight away they may just dismiss it if that happens its our fault not the players thats why summoning had to have a quest
3631274 if by the end of the wolf whistle quest you understand how summoning functions then weve succeeded the fact that it was developed by an excellent quest writer helps
3631275 we are also adding some other smaller features to the game later this month such as clockwork toys for your cats teleportation tablets making your own cups of tea and even chairs you can sit down in
3631276 by not mentioning upcoming updates less players talk about them releasing information provokes conversations on the forum and gets people talking and speculating
3631277 also by not mentioning upcoming updates less players talk about these positive things releasing information provokes conversations on the future updates forum and gets people talking and speculating
3631278 some people also like to plan their training for something as game affecting as summoning which crosses over with every skill and even changes our combat level calculation players appreciate the notice
3631279 i had that pang of regret that we werent just going to throw it out there unannounced i really wanted to surprise everyone with the skill and knock their socks off
3631280 not least because of the bulldog i have fond memories of a bulldog my uncle owned shed just lie at my feet snoring and farting all day
3631281 once it was released someone posted that they had got into the pet shop before being kicked out by a grumpy pet shop owner
3631282 and the idea was inspired by the film usual suspects
3631283 the chaosudoku was completed within hours hidden words were found in minutes and only the longest anagrams are yet to be solved
3631284 each creature has unique summoning requirements special moves abilities distinct personalities and hidden chat options so no one could possibly experience them all as they rise through the levels
3631285 its my favourite members skill that ive helped to release
3631286 in terms of quality and quantity nothing really matches it
3631287 each creature has unique summoning requirements special moves abilities distinct personalities and hidden chat options so no one could possibly experience them all as they rise through the levels
3631288 its quite interesting seeing some of the things that are bandied about on the forums considered to be fact

3631320 i kept fouling the pitches off and finally he left the right one over the plate where i could do that
3631321 i come to the ballpark every day ready to play ready to start willing to do whatever the team needs
3631322 youve got to earn a lot in this game earn your spot and your chances
3631323 the game started off slow but juan had a great at bat and got some momentum going back our way
3631324 they had put up zeros to that point but juans home run put us back in the game
3631325 in the past month if you give up runs you know youre going to get them right back
3631326 for more than half the games probably 60 of the games
3631327 the way i feel at the plate right now is the best ive felt all season
3631328 its all due to my legs the strength is back im glad its at a point where its not a problem
3631329 we were not exactly a juggernaut we didnt score a lot of runs yet we won 94 games and a big part of it was bobby because he was always available
3631330 he kept you on the edge of your seat at times he wasnt automatic
3631331 he had almost a whirling dervish delivery kind of like rodriguez legs and arms flying but he was a big strong horse
3631332 it takes a solid pen to help you get to that number
3631333 the stark truth the most overrated and underrated players in baseball history
3631334 the siouxsie and the banshees of relievers because this guy is one of baseballs epic one hit wonders yes thigpens 57 save season still stood as the all time single season record last time anybody checked but surrounding that season heres what youll find no other 35 save seasons a 3 43 career era an opponent batting average of 252 and a blown save for every four he converted
3631335 he happened to hit terry in the head and it caused a melee
3631336 bobby was in the middle of the scuffle and was down on the ground and when it was cleared i remember saying to him are you all right i think he hurt his back he continued to pitch but he wasnt quite the same after that his command was off and the ball didnt seem to have quite as much pop
3631337 i felt like i was ready to get back into professional ball
3631338 ive been trying to get back with the white sox in some capacity for the last couple of years i just wanted to get back into baseball and do something

3631370 islam itu berdiri atas 5 hal bersaksi bahwa tiada tuhan yang haq selain allah dan muhammad adalah rasul nya mendirikan sholat menunaikan zaat berpuasa di bulan ramadhan dan haji bila mampu
3631371 berpuasalah ketika melihat hilal dan berbukalah karena melihat hilal apabila penglihatan kalian terhalang maka sempurnakanlah menjadi 30 hari
3631372 apabila ramadhan telah masuk maka pintu pintu surga dibuka pintu pintu jahannam ditutup serta syaithon syaithon dibelenggu
3631373 apabila ramadhan datang maka berseru seorang penyeru wahai orang yang menghendaki kebaikan lakukan dan laksanakanlah wahai orang yang menghendaki keburukan kurangilah dan alloh memiliki orang orang yang dibebaskan dari neraka dan hal ini terjadi setiap malam sampai berakhirnya ramadhan
3631374 setiap amal bani adam dilipatgandakan kebaikan diganjar sepuluh kali lipat yang sepadan dengannya hingga sampai seratus kali lipat bahkan hingga sampai kepada apa yang alloh kehendaki alloh azza wa jalla berfirman kecuali puasa karena sesungguhnya puasa itu untukku dan aku sendirilah yang akan membalasnya ia meninggalkan syahwat dan makannya hanya karena aku bagi orang yang berpuasa ada dua kegembiraan yaitu kegembiraan tatkala ia berbuka dan kegembiraan tatkala ia bertemu dengan rabb nya sungguh bau mulut seorang yang berpuasa itu adalah lebih harum di sisi alloh dibandingkan harumnya kesturi
3631375 sesungguhnya di dalam surga ada sebuah pintu yang disebut dengan ar royyan orang orang yang berpuasa masuk darinya pada hari kiamat dan tidak ada seorangpun selain mereka yang dapat memasukinya apabila mereka orang orang yang berpuasa pent telah memasukinya pintu tersebut ditutup dan tidak ada lagi seorangpun yang dapat memasukinya
3631376 barangsiapa berpuasa di bulan ramadhan dengan keimanan dan ihtisab mengharap balasan dari alloh maka diampuni dosadosanya yang terdahulu
3631377 antara sholat lima waktu antara jumat dengan jumat antara ramadhan dengan ramadhan terdapat kafarat penghapus dosa diantaranya selama dosa dosa besar dijauhi
3631378 tidaklah seorang hamba berpuasa sehari di jalan alloh melainkan alloh jauhkan pada hari itu wajahnya dari neraka sejauh tujuh puluh kharif jarak perjalanan
3631379 puasa dan al qur an memberikan syafaat bagi seorang hamba pada hari kiamat puasa berkata wahai rabb sesungguhnya aku telah menahannya dari makan dan syahwat di siang hari maka berilah dia syafaat karenaku al quran berkata wahai rabb sesungguhnya aku telah menahannya dari tidur di malam hari untuk membacaku maka berilah dia syafaat karenaku maka allah mengabulkan syafaat keduanya
3631380 artinya dan apabila hamba hamba ku bertanya kepadamu tentang aku maka jawablah bahwasanya aku adalah dekat aku mengabulkan permohonan orang yang berdoa apabila ia memohon kepada ku maka hendaklah mereka itu memenuhi segala perintah ku dan hendaklah mereka beriman kepada ku agar mereka selalu berada dalam kebenaran
3631381 dihalalkan bagi kamu pada malam hari bulan puasa bercampur dengan istri istri kamu mereka itu adalah pakaian bagimu dan kamu pun adalah pakaian bagi mereka allah mengetahui bahwasanya kamu tidak dapat menahan nafsumu karena itu allah mengampuni kamu dan memberi maaf kepadamu maka sekarang campurilah mereka dan carilah apa yang telah ditetapkan allah untukmu dan makan minumlah hingga terang bagimu benang putih dari benang hitam yaitu fajar kemudian sempurnakanlah puasa itu sampai datang malam tetapi janganlah kamu campuri mereka itu sedang kamu beri tikaf dalam mesjid itulah larangan allah maka janganlah kamu mendekatinya demikianlah allah menerangkan ayat ayat nya kepada manusia supaya mereka bertakwa
3631382 makan dan minumlah ketika kalian mendengar bilal adzan sesungguhnya bilal adzan untuk membangunkan orang untuk sholat malam dan berhentilah makan dan minum ketika ummi maktum adzan karena dia tidaklah adzan kecuali waktu subuh sudah datang

3631385 ik heb een hoop reverse engineering op het apple platform gezien
3631386 windows ontwikkelaars kunnen hun bestaande code pakken en deze eenvoudig laten werken op het apple platform
3631387 mogelijk nemen ze dan echter ook bestaande kwetsbaarheden in de code mee naar het apple platform of ze cre ren nieuwe omdat ze op een compleet ander platform werken
3631388 het toont dat mensen bekwaam worden in het analyseren van apple software
3631389 er kijken mensen naar de iphone we geven kwetsbaarheden door aan de ontwikkelaars van de software en zodra we contact hebben met apple vragen ze ons of we de kwetsbaarheden ook al op de iphone hebben uitgetest ze willen niet voor verrassingen komen te staan

3631391 the urgent and critical situation of the indigenous peoples sector has brought us here
3631392 the arroyo government is wiping out indigenous communities all over the country through its militarist and aggressive economic policies another reason is that the president does not intend to cease these injustices
3631393 the realization of the rights of national minorities to ancestral lands and self determination will only be fully realized when the government is no longer bound by capitalist interests until then the indigenous and moro peoples rights is only second to the interests of companies interested in the resources found in ancestral domains
3631394 saat ini angan angan jakarta bebas dari banjir harus disimpan dulu dalam dalam karena selain faktor sampah dan endapan pengerukan belum bisa dilaksanakan secara terintegritas

3631547 if i ever forget can i come over for a reminder
3631548 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3631549 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3631550 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3631551 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3631552 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3631553 im laughing at suv owners all the way to the bank
3631554 i rarely speed i stop at red lights i dont tailgate i dont swerve in and out of lanes i dont talk on the phone listen to my ipod or send text messages when im driving
3631555 ferrying loads of soccer kids schoolkids their kids and their friends kids
3631556 large families were making due quite well in station wagons before the suv boom
3631557 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3631558 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3631559 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3631560 we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime
3631561 the united states is a reliable partner in the world
3631562 ua student to cover the gop convention for myspace nbc news
3631563 sheriff didnt it occur to you that you might have been arresting the wrong people
3631564 the regular gathering preparing collecting photographing recording writing editing reporting or publishing of news or information that concerns local national or international events or other matters of public interest for dissemination to the public
3631565 in the end they had a better day at the office than we did
3631566 the screaming crowd influences the judges thats the home court advantage
3631567 i just let the nerves get the best of me
3631568 china is a crowded country about the size of the usa with quadruple the population
3631569 patriotic education starts from kindergarten and individual value is perceived as relatively insignificant compared to the u s
3631570 then i got here and learned what happened teammate mike friedman was really upset about it
3631571 its weird to come to the olympics and have all this weird media attention
3631572 mike on his blog would get hate mail hed be reading that every day we had to take his blackberry away from him hed just get depressed
3631573 a doctor from the usoc sent a note saying you should wear these masks in all transportation centers the fact that the usoc didnt back that wasnt very cool
3631574 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3631575 i thought shawn and nastia really fought hard and they had a great meet today
3631576 unfortunately we had two big falls and china had a good performance in this kind of meet you have to hit all of your events
3631577 i tried to look past it i tried to keep competing
3631578 i dont know what happened on floor i thought my feet were underneath me on that arabian next thing i know i was on my back
3631579 it was kind of hard because shes always the one who keeps everyone up
3631580 she just kept telling us that she was sorry shes a human humans are going to make mistakes were not robots china did have a few mistakes but they had less mistakes than we did
3631581 its like baseball in the united states its a simple game of course its good for your health
3631582 you train your body you stay fit its not like running but you can do it in a limited area
3631583 especially my generation was even more competitive because at that time the kids didnt have that many choices
3631584 they only pick five on the team youve got to be a genius
3631585 hes just a normal person but he might be from another planet

3631587 i started thinking about it and thats when i started tearing up
3631588 to be at the top with so many great athletes whove walked in these olympic games its a pretty amazing feeling
3631589 it got worse and worse through the race and going to the 150 wall and the finish i couldnt see the wall i was just hoping i was winning and i could hit the wall first
3631590 dude unbelievable how many times a day do i have to see your ugly face
3631591 im tremendously honored not only to be inducted in this hockey hall of fame but to be amongst brett hull brian leetch and mike richter is really big for me
3631592 maybe wyoming coaches and players lost a little bit of confidence in me
3631593 some stuff was said here and there stuff was bouncing the wrong way a little bit
3631594 that put everything in perspective it just showed how low things can get its never about the kick before its always about the next one you can come in 10 for 10 but you cant think about that that year really was important in proving that to me and it made me confident that i can come back from adversity
3631595 coming from denver the small town aspect of laramie not to mention its a little bit chilly there and the wind blows all the time i just felt like this was the place for me if football wasnt going well id still be happy in boulder i love it here
3631596 it doesnt surprise me that aric is having a great fall camp and i expect that will continue
3631597 when you get confidence and are a good technician the ball goes through aric is doing a good job of that
3631598 the decision was based purely on numbers on performance and carpenter has outperformed him right now thats the bottom line
3631599 its like riding a bicycle its like i never left
3631600 he was cheering me up more than i was able to cheer him up
3631601 todo el mundo quiere saber c mo fue y que sent pen lope tiene menos vello facial que un hombre por lo que me dio mucho m s placer fue mejor que besar a jonathan rhys meyers en match point

3631603 but if he is taking something written by somebody else and putting it together as some sort of compilation to create the book then some different inferences might flow
3631604 i dont even know why my client is wearing the thing on his head

3631606 about 11am aest one of the aircraft pilots declared an aircraft emergency and diverted to coffs harbour airport to land he said
3631607 one hawk landed safely at 11 40am and the other has returned to williamtown near newcastle
3631608 the aircraft was circling over the ocean to receive a standard damage check from the other hawk pilot the spokesman said
3631609 while circulating the aircraft was also burning off fuel to reduce its landing weight
3631610 yesterdays shower in beijing will bring down the mercury and clear the haze shrouding the city
3631611 i hope it gives them the shot in the arm to keep moving forward
3631612 theyve had a tough time of it theyre 43rd in points and they need to get some momentum going hopefully this will help them im not the answer but they gave me a great piece everything i asked for
3631613 hes getting really in good game shape he hasnt been shooting well but today he didnt concentrate on shooting he concentrated on rebounding and then the shots came we havent shot the ball well from the outside since weve been here but i believe we will to see carmelo come on like that its encouraging
3631614 i told coach before this tournament im going to try to get the record 16 rebounds in one of these games
3631615 i know i can score at any given time but ill leave the scoring up to kobe bryant le bron james and dwyane wade hes playing fantastic right now so if i can go out there and grab 16 rebounds thats a whole lot better for the team than scoring 20 25 points thats my role rebound and defend
3631616 we couldnt wait to get into a game and get this thing started were so sick of practice
3631617 we are harnessing our global network of technical and financial expertise to unlock the potential of the vast canadian oil sands deposit in the usa we are helping to build what will be the nations largest refinery
3631618 because we had not seen data that showed how shell was effectively managing carbon emissions from its oil sands projects in order to limit climate change we concluded that on this point the ad was misleading
3631619 although emissions might be reduced on a per barrel basis the increased production of the refinery by 325 000 barrels per day would increase the total overall emissions from the port arthur refinery
3631620 because of that and because sustainable was an ambiguous and unclear term we concluded that the ad was misleading
3631621 a growing world needs more energy but at the same time we need to find new ways of managing carbon emissions to limit climate change continued investment in technology is one of the key ways we are able to address this challenge and continue to secure a profitable and sustainable future
3631622 to unlock the potential of the vast canadian oil sands deposits
3631623 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3631624 this recent conflict in georgia has highlighted the heavy dependence that international oil and gas operators place on the countries that lie along the pipeline transport corridor
3631625 what has been highlighted over the past few days is that despite the careful routing of pipelines to avoid both russia and the middle east it still comes with a very significant degree of political risk
3631626 it is quite remarkable that the world has lost one million barrels but the market has not really been bothered it shows a fundamental shift in market perceptions
3631627 id be very surprised if this hasnt arrived in the uk by 2009

3631741 over the past several months i have received correspondence from a number of people regarding a paper i wrote with mr craib and drs montaner oshaughnessy schechter and strathdee in the international journal of epidemiology on the gay and bisexual life expectancy in vancouver in the late 1980s and early 1990s 1 from this correspondence it appears that our research is being used by select groups in united states and other countries to suggest that gay and bisexual men live an unhealthy lifestyle that is destructive to themselves and to others these homophobic groups appear more interested in restricting the human rights of gay and bisexuals rather than promoting their health and well being
3631742 in contrast if we were to repeat this analysis today the life expectancy of gay and bisexual men would be greatly improved deaths from hiv infection have declined dramatically in this population since 1996 as we have previously reported there has been a three fold decrease in mortality in vancouver as well as in other parts of british columbia 2

3631752 pick up a copy of your local newspaper tabulate the average age of adults in the obituaries perhaps ruling out accidental deaths over the course of week you should have an indicator that would parallel closely to information provided by the us census bureau

3631981 the greatest achievement was at first and for a time a dream the oak sleeps in the acorn the bird waits in the egg and in the highest vision of the soul a waking angel stirs dreams are the seedlings of realities
3631982 my music and my clothes are really a reflection of who i am and its been really cool to see that resonate with my fans
3631983 but this is the first time i have seen anything like this
3631984 pentru toate solicitarile nemultumirile care v au fost aduse la cunostinta anterior si care nu si au gasit rezolvare pana astazi
3631985 credem cu convingere asa cum am precizat mereu pana acum ca dialogul deschis cu reprezentantii sindicatului este cea mai buna cale de a rezolva orice problema
3631986 nu credem ca acest process al dialogului ar fi inchis in vreun fel
3631987 lenovo has engineered a new breed of mobile workstation with the thinkpad w700 no other pc manufacturer has a mobile workstation that delivers the sheer power performance and cutting edge innovation that lenovo has packed into the thinkpad w700 the thinkpad w700 mobile workstation flat out delivers the command performance our customers demand at the desk as well as in the field
3631988 we cant get anywhere denying that there are neurological and hormonal differences between males and females because there clearly are
3631989 no boy wants to do well at math so he can impress girls trust me
3631990 in fact law and medicine both have greater prestige than engineering or computer programming

3631994 dr rice has no other qualifications other than her race and sex as that is all that right wing republicans can mention
3631995 the problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he saddam can acquire nuclear weapons but we dont want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud
3631996 we do know that he is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon we do know that there have been shipments going into iraq for instance of aluminum tubes that are really only suited for nuclear weapons programs
3631997 saddam husayn ended the nuclear program in 1991 following the gulf war the iraq survey group found no evidence to suggest concerted efforts to restart the program
3631998 we do know that saddam is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon
3631999 no one is trying to make an argument at this point that saddam hussein somehow had operational control of what happened on september 11 so we dont want to push this too far but this is a story that is unfolding and it is getting clear and were learning more but yes there clearly are contact s between al qaeda and iraq that can be documented there clearly is testimony that some of the contacts have been important contacts and that there is a relationship there
3632000 now the al qaida is an organization thats quite dispersed and and quite widespread in its effects but it clearly has had links to the iraqis not to mention iraqi links to all kinds of other terrorists
3632001 every president who has been successful at least that i know of in the history of this republic has developed both informal and formal means of getting checks on whether people who tell him things are in fact telling him the whole truth the recent history has been a reliance on the nsc system to do it i quite frankly think that has not served this president very well
3632002 our interaction with the rest of the world must be a conversation not a monologue
3632003 apparrently dr rice has no other qualifications other than her race and sex as that is all that right wing republicans can mention
3632004 the end of life the permanent cessation of vital bodily functions as manifested in humans by the loss of heartbeat the absence of spontaneous breathing and brain death
3632005 the end of life the permanent cessation of vital bodily functions as manifested in humans by the loss of heartbeat and brain death
3632006 the life of an american citizen begins the moment that citizen gains the function of both the heart and the brain no laws shall be passed intruding on the rights of american citizens
3632007 i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so
3632008 my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and it is not either to save or destroy slavery if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union
3632009 notwithstanding all the proclamations we have made to mankind within the last ninety years that our government rests on consent and that that was the rightful basis on which any government could rest the late war has practically demonstrated that our government rests upon force as much so as any government that ever existed
3632010 how could we the southern states have been so wrong
3632011 the real history of the civil war is that people in the north got fed up with allowing the barbaric practice of slavery to continue

3632016 deze omstandigheden beinvloeden ook de doelen voor het rendement op geinvesteerd kapitaal roce zij het in geringere mate wij blijven vastbesloten om een roce van ten minste 12 te realiseren voor csm als geheel
3632017 hes just a normal person but he might be from another planet
3632018 not just a different planet a different galaxy let him say which planet i get the same question all the time on the medal stand
3632019 i started thinking about it and thats when i started tearing up
3632020 to be at the top with so many great athletes whove walked in these olympic games its a pretty amazing feeling
3632021 im just going to think like im playing with my local club really once youre on the field and youve had a look thats about it
3632022 it was a bit of a shock hopefully i can back it up
3632023 its amazing im shocked about that to be honest even though he has been there for me for everything taken me overseas thats just awesome
3632024 theres some nerves in there but im excited i cant wait for it
3632025 ive learned so much already in just a short time being here hes kosmina changed my game heaps
3632026 since leaving spamlot in may jokes have just not been funny food has lost its taste the grass is no longer green the sky no longer blue and babies wont stop crying im so excited about coming back to the funniest show in the world
3632027 i still dont think weve played anywhere close to our best basketball
3632028 theyve been through the fire already and played a lot of high level games
3632029 the circumstances are here to have exceptional games iaaf president lamine diack said
3632030 it sounded really interesting getting to make what you designed in your head
3632031 people are really interested in enrichment for their children more than just having fun they really want them to learn some of these girls may not be fashion designers but they may decide they want to work in the industry
3632032 with our camp theres a wonderful feeling of hand making things as parents we love the idea theyre doing these homey activities
3632033 parents are interested in getting their kids started on career exploration a lot earlier kids too are thinking more about what they want in the future
3632034 and its more fun this way you might as well go to camp for something that interests you
3632035 a lot of activity and a lot of it outdoors
3632036 its important for parents to ask the question what does my child really need
3632037 they need to make a decision for themselves and their child about whats the best way to test interests do i need a sampler kind of experience or am i so experienced that i can take all day doing one thing
3632038 they watch a lot of tv they think the same person goes to the crime scene and collects the evidence and interrogates the suspects this shows them what the work is really like
3632039 they see the work can be tedious and you have to be thorough
3632040 its fun to see them find a piece of hidden evidence they get so excited
3632041 on the opposite end if you drop a gum wrapper they think its related
3632042 i figured this was as real as it was going to get
3632043 if i like this then this is a possible career
3632044 when kids go to a general camp they start to develop interests in certain areas
3632045 the key is that its not that families are choosing specialty camps as a replacement to general camp especially for the younger kids
3632046 theres been a growth spurt in camps in the last 10 years we saw the enrollments going up in general camps and specialty camps followed
3632047 it used to be camp was designed to focus on athletics and if you werent an athletic child you still ended up in an athletic camp
3632048 now if youre not there are more cerebral options so it opens the doors to more kids going to camps
3632049 our motto is if its not fun were not doing it
3632050 although its based in science i like to think our camp encompasses a lot more working together
3632051 a lot of this camp is discovery them working on their own
3632052 they dont get to do hands on science in school anymore
3632053 im going to tell my mother my brother had the worst boat
3632054 its a lot of fun when you have something to do in summer so you dont sit around all day
3632055 and then when its done you can go home and play
3632056 i fail on a regular basis and i thought this would be a good spot for me i mean i failed five times in that sentence
3632057 most entrepreneurs fail time and time again before they hit it big and truth be told theres a lot more to learn from failure than success
3632058 most success is a combination of luck perseverance and a whole lot of previous failure
3632059 as bad as it got and it got really bad i could recover now im not afraid to fail you can take all my money evict me and i know ill climb back out its weird people are always taught about success people rarely talk about failure
3632060 i love the idea of not being afraid to fail
3632061 they have been attacking georgia from a cyber standpoint since july
3632062 our poor technician here has gotten three hours sleep in the past four days
3632063 the cyber attack was taking down every georgian government website
3632064 it is simply too early and we lack enough information to reach any conclusion as to the motive and identity of the attackers
3632065 these types of attack are only natural and happen immediately following any conflict or political tension
3632066 this actually looks more like grass roots hacktivist types people that jumped on the bandwagon
3632067 its like the olympics we are supposed to be above politics in the internet community
3632068 spiele und filmwelten befruchten sich gegenseitig sehr stark das ist keineswegs mehr eine einbahnstra e
3632069 deswegen suche ich auf der games convention den direkten austausch mit der gamesbranche

3632074 the doctors in vegas told me that i wouldnt be able to walk for four to six months and i thought to myself you just played in your last game
3632075 he really hasnt missed a beat and the amazing thing is he is moving around better and running better than a year ago because hes lighter
3632076 you see the movies of the guy pushing his wife in a wheelchair and her holding the baby i wanted that to be me
3632077 so that was my motivation to be walking before then
3632078 when the doctors told us that in the las vegas hospital she was worried she would have to be taking care of two babies
3632079 its been one of the great stories of the offseason
3632080 hes back and he might be better than hes ever been
3632081 i think its one of the best one of the fastest around
3632082 our defensive ends are unbelievable the line is coming into their own and our dbs are great
3632083 its not like we were going up against a bunch of slouches
3632084 people talk about how inexperienced they are but what they fail to realize is a lot of those guys played a lot of snaps for us mike wright nai fotu and stevenson sylvester all played a lot its not like they havent been in a division i college football game before
3632085 if both are working its an 04 year that is the bottom line if they are both working together

3632091 it depends on the rebel resistance how fast we can proceed with the rehabilitation phase
3632092 we have to clear the area and declare it safe first
3632093 the leaders met again on tuesday but could not arrive at a workable formula or solution that would appease the people
3632094 the leaders will report to the prime minister of their deliberations and maybe some announcement will be made

3632099 we were thinking that an nba team was going to make an offer
3632100 were going to come back even stronger in the team finals
3632101 the fans are crazy they know you everywhere you go

3632109 were proud to be able to offer our clients the first sharia compliant deal in indias growing real estate and retail market
3632110 this deal provides investors with an attractive return and upside potential in one of the fastest growing emerging markets
3632111 the rentals of it sez segment in gurgaon and noida witnessed correction with values declining by 3 per cent and 13 per cent over the quarter respectively
3632112 i wanted to do a triathlon before i was 50
3632113 after you get older you want to prove more things to yourself mentally and physically you want to stay younger so you push the envelope
3632114 but for most of them its a life experience in a sports venue
3632115 its all about what i can do not about anybody else
3632116 pretty cool ive had people say i am an inspiration to them
3632117 i carried that across the finish line anything is possible
3632118 the last major addition to californias water systems was in the 1960s
3632119 our state had 16 million people then we have 38 million now and we have the same water infrastructure
3632120 and it just seems that the issue becomes one of ideological purity rather than political solutions
3632121 this is the state of my birth i have never seen it in this condition with the dryness the fires the deteriorating snowpack
3632122 theres every overt danger signal our water infrastructure is inadequate
3632123 in my mind its ok if i have to spend a little more because i really want to go for the experience
3632124 but im going to have to live kind of frugally during the fall semester so that i can afford to be over there
3632125 even if students have some kind of financial aid that doesnt help them with the cost of living
3632126 studying abroad is a transformative experience but students really have to sock away money or count on the largess of their families to help them out
3632127 it used to be that these programs were seen as an add on but increasingly were seeing campuses that are looking at study abroad as a key part of undergraduate education
3632128 we havent had drastic pullouts but there are some students whove had to change their plans
3632129 theres anecdotal evidence that the numbers of students studying abroad may either hold or decrease
3632130 the euro is whats killing everyone because about 70 percent of our students end up studying in europe
3632131 and everything is less expensive than in the states theres inexpensive fruit 23 cent baguettes and its easy and relatively cheap to travel in country
3632132 theyre choosing so called nontraditional destinations like latin america the african continent and south asia thats been a silver lining of this process
3632133 our national leaders are looking at this as something that we cant cut back on and must invest in
3632134 its an expensive academic program to run but one that pays great dividends
3632135 we believe they need to come out of their partisan corners
3632136 we are going to have to see what the total package is
3632137 what the governor proposed i am not sure can be characterized as a tax increase
3632138 i have so many things to worry about and the state budget was one more thing
3632139 for right now were going to do what we have to do to comply with the executive order these tests are important and theyre needed if we continue to not have a budget this is going to become a severe challenge for my agency
3632140 ive been waiting for 3 1 2 years actually more
3632141 i hesitated to speak on this because i know we all want to go to lunch
3632142 wearing shorts by youth are prohibited because it violates the principals of islamic religion when showing forbidden parts of the body also women should wear the veil
3632143 islamic religion is an easy religion and it allows wearing sport shorts as long as they dont show the forbidden parts of the body so the acts that are targeting the sport are criminal
3632144 the shareholders in attendance approved the establishment of more production capacity for more modules in more countries
3632145 wir sind nicht umsonst als organisator der pr sentation in berlin ausgesucht worden
3632146 der ruf der handwerkskammer als technologiekammer also der technologief hrenden wirtschaftskammer in deutschland ist l ngst auch im bundeswirtschaftsministerium bekannt ebenso wie die tatsache dass die handwerkskammer stichwort messeauftritte auf der internationalen handwerksmesse m nchen in mailand oder im auftrag der bayerischen staatskanzlei in narbonne frankreich bzw montreal kanada in der lage ist auch auf grund ihrer sehr guten kontakte zu f hrenden handwerksunternehmen aus der region derartige pr sentationen zu realisieren
3632147 dank der fr hzeitig ge nderten gesch ftsstruktur mit der verringerung der abh ngigkeit des unternehmens vom station ren einzelhandel in deutschland hat der konzern die eintr bung des konsumklimas berwiegend gut verkraftet
3632148 die beiden wachstumsstarken gesch ftsbereiche thomas cook und primondo entwickeln sich sehr gut und konnten sich operativ weiter verbessern karstadt der umsatzm ig kleinste gesch ftsbereich bekam die konjunkturelle eintr bung in deutschland deutlich zu sp ren
3632149 das gesch ft l uft bei thomas cook rund und es sind keine anzeichen einer r ckl ufigen konjunktur sichtbar auch die buchungssaison f r den winter 2008 und den sommer 2009 weist bislang eine starke entwicklung auf
3632150 wir verfolgen mit dem begonnenen trading up die richtige strategie unsere herausforderung liegt darin die kostenentwicklung wieder unter kontrolle zu bringen
3632151 wir haben den konzern in den vergangenen vier jahren konsequent neu ausgerichtet haben die abh ngigkeit vom station ren handel in deutschland massiv verringert den tourismus zum neuen hauptgesch ftsfeld ausgebaut und den homeshoppingbereich zu einem wachstumsgesch ft entwickelt
3632152 so ist es uns gelungen jahr f r jahr das bereinigte ebitda unserer operativen gesch ftsbereiche zu steigern wir werden das auch in diesem jahr ungeachtet der ver nderten rahmenbedingungen schaffen
3632153 strategisch setzen wir uneingeschr nkt auf die wachstumsfelder touristik und homeshopping deshalb werden wir das organische und externe wachstum in beiden bereichen forcieren f r unser warenhausgesch ft sind wir noch in der phase der festlegung einer endg ltigen strategischen ausrichtung
3632154 frankly i didnt think investors would react to the gdp data this much
3632155 but it probably made them reconfirm that the recession will continue throughout this year or even until the end of this business year the data could be used as an excuse to run away from risk assets
3632156 theres strong speculation in tokyo that the u s financial sector will be sold off tonight as the short sale rule is about to be lifted
3632157 in addition moves by speculators are largely affecting the market as the number of market participants are small with today being the peak day of summer holidays in japan
3632158 vi g r os tanker om et borgerkort hvor fingeraftryk kan erstatte en pinkode men vi er stadig p visionsstadiet derfor kan mange ting n at ndre sig og sikkerhedsl sningerne kan variere alt efter hvilken service kortet skal bruges til

3632198 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3632199 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3632200 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college
3632201 ninety one percent of the decline in notices of default since april can be attributed to countrywide financial
3632202 unfortunately this is more likely due to the challenges of integrating two companies the size of countrywide financial and bank of america than it is a fundamental shift in foreclosure activity

3632212 john mccain would come across to russia as a stronger person someone with opinions they would listen to
3632213 he has shown he listens to people and he has an ability to synthesize opinion
3632214 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i said to him today we are all georgians
3632215 the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world
3632216 i dont see how either mccain or obama has the experience to deal with this
3632217 obama doesnt know what hes talking about but i worry that mccain is too old
3632218 and just because someone was in a war doesnt mean theyll make a good president
3632219 mccain gave his usual knee jerk response full of testosterone and maybe obama showed some people he is not as seasoned on foreign policy
3632220 they asked me why i was going to kuanjie protestant church to worship and threatened me saying you are not allowed to go to kuanjie protestant church because president bush is going there today
3632221 if you try to go again we will break your legs
3632222 wanted to see bush he had something he wanted to talk to him about
3632223 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing
3632224 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
3632225 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
3632226 its an incident that opens a whole powerful window on religious repression in china
3632227 this is simply not a time for politics as usual
3632228 its a different john mccain saying make the tax cuts permanent
3632229 a very large number of us feel deeply that john mccain good man that he is will be a continuation of bush

3632239 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd
3632240 he is threatening to water down the essential message of evangelical christianity
3632241 and that is what causes people to grow a little insecure and concerned and maybe even disconcerted

3632243 at this time were just moving forward with the case as it stands
3632244 going forward the united states and europe must support the people of georgia beyond immediate humanitarian assistance we must provide economic assistance and help rebuild what has been destroyed i have consistently called for deepening relations between georgia and transatlantic institutions including a membership action plan for nato and we must continue to press for that deeper relationship

3632250 it just shows all the things were doing in education are working and students are doing better
3632251 we still have a long way to go to have the number of students prepared to really compete in todays world economy
3632252 we still have far too many students graduating from high school without the skills necessary to succeed
3632253 i was kind of overwhelmed with a lot of the work that had to be done
3632254 i remember the days gone by when you would watch a raiders game on tv and the stands would be full
3632255 what if instead of working for back yard burger for 6 an hour work for me work for city schools
3632256 its the same tune weve been singing for five years
3632257 at rotary i said we need to sit down and talk about it and he said hed like to
3632258 so were trying to schedule a meeting to talk about it
3632259 our programs actually dovetail they shouldnt compete we cant compete with our customer we will work hand in glove with dr cash in any way that he sees we can be an asset to the community
3632260 and since i spent the last 20 years creating and building new technology companies i happen to know that what creates companies and what creates jobs are products and technologies that are invented by scientists and engineers
3632261 dont ever go on cnbc to debate bob compton one of americas most energetic prophets of doom without careful preparation and a willingness to be rude
3632262 he and i generally agree that american high schools need to get much better more rigorous and need to challenge kids in a way theyre not doing now i think were absolutely on the same wavelength there
3632263 but this scare tactic that weve got to fix our schools or were going to become the third world of the world is false
3632264 its pretty clear that if you look at how our kids are doing in school theyre way ahead of the education kids are getting in most other countries
3632265 indians and chinese people pursue academic and intellectual training the way americans pursue sports with passion rigor and intensity
3632266 two million minutes casts a bright spotlight on a crisis in this country

3632268 i could care less about naming your road im not interested in naming it
3632269 i thought maybe the best thing we can do is change it the way they hope we will
3632270 when you take a name from that person for the name of our road you are really sticking it to us
3632271 you have insulted me and you have questioned my integrity i am sick and tired of you people coming back with the same name
3632272 my wife bought a new house and painted everything blaaaack
3632273 you know i want to set those people over there on fire but im just not close enough to get the job done
3632274 the situation right now is weve had an overwhelming response
3632275 in years past we had three or four dozen folks that would take advantage of this to the tune of 250 to 300 cords of wood now we have a list that is probably 300 to 400 people
3632276 folks maybe had a hunting camp near the public lands or they lived nearby i suspect a fair number were repeat customers
3632277 we were not ready for the level of response and it will take us some time to get prepared to provide the service to all of those who want to participate
3632278 were putting them on a list and will get back in touch with people as we work our way through that list weve had hundreds in the last week were going to need time to handle that level

3632280 pemerintah menyambut baik karena sejak semula sikap dan usulan pemerintah ke arah itu ke arah sistem proporsional terbuka tanpa nomor urut apa yang yang kini dikenal dengan suara terbanyak bukan nomor sepatu
3632281 tentu ini lebih adil memberikan kesamaan kesempatan dan betul betul suara konstituen di masing masing daerah itu diwujudkan dengan siapa yang mewakilinya
3632282 saya sampaikan bahwa secara pribadi maupun posisi pemerintah ternyata sama dengan pandangan ini untuk kita betul betul menuju sistem proporsional terbuka ini langkah maju dari perkembangan demokrasi di tanah air

3632289 you have to have appropriate fiscal management to allow the state to do the rest of the work of the legislature and the governor
3632290 state treasurer david lemoine said the department will no longer invest tax dollars into such risky ventures
3632291 we think we will be paid we think we will be paid in full
3632292 lemoine said he believes the state will be paid back the 20 million plus interest but that its impossible to know when
3632293 its probably safe to say if we had known we would not have allowed that investment to proceed
3632294 we have a three tiered screening process for figuring out where these funds go and that process was in operation
3632295 this was in no way a subprime investment it now seems accurate to say that the mainsail situation is the result of last summers subprime investment concerns but the situation developed despite the high quality ratings applied to both the company and its underlying assets i am confident the state will recoup the investment so long as we do not succumb to panic selling
3632296 lemoine said he initially thought the state would get its money back relatively quickly and that he didnt see it as an emergency
3632297 treasury had some of the most qualified professional advisers in the nation working with us when the mainsail ii investment was made last august
3632298 lemoine said mainsail ii still has assets that can be sold and the states chances of getting its money back depend on what price those assets are sold at
3632299 lemoine believes the state is in a good position among those owed money from the mainsail ii fund but he said he dare not predict when the matter will be resolved
3632300 the states 20 million investment last year in a mortgage backed fund that went from a top credit rating to junk bond status almost overnight was worth less than 7 million at the close of the fiscal year june 30 barring a dramatic increase in the mainsail ii funds value the state would have to write off more than 13 million if it were sold today
3632301 what is happening in this state is like gestapo methods of controlling people and kennels breeders pet centers frankly im afraid of this department the state animal welfare program very afraid
3632302 as a dog owner i believe fully in the old adage that you can judge a person by how they treat animals it is our responsibility to care for the well being of our pets and we must ensure that those who mistreat animals of any kind are made accountable for their actions

3632308 abu bakr has narrated that the messenger of all h pbuh had sexual intercourse with mariyah in the house of hafsa when the messenger came out of the house hafsa was sitting at the gate behind the locked door she told the prophet o messenger of all h do you do this in my house and during my turn the prophet said control yourself and let me go for i make her haram to me hafsa said i do not accept unless you swear for me that hazrat his holiness said by all h i will not touch her again
3632309 none of you muslims should offer the asr prayer but at banu quraizas place
3632310 we will not offer it till we reach it the place of banu quraiza
3632311 no we will pray at this spot for the prophet did not mean that for us

3632320 the georgians have agreed to a cease fire the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3632321 the idea is to show the russians that it is no longer business as usual
3632322 we have been hearing from russia we dont want to stay
3632323 they believe that they have made some progress and we welcome that and we certainly welcome the e u mediation

3632327 you couldnt have a starker contrast between the multiple layers of check and balances at cbs and a guy sitting in his living room in his pajamas writing
3632328 they practice all winter long and some people travel a long way to donate their time
3632329 then they raise money for charity every week all summer long

3632335 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3632336 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3632337 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3632338 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3632339 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3632340 i think everybody knows you always have good days and bad days
3632341 i said i would not go to the police r was worried and knew where my mum dad and brother lived and would have me shot if i went to police and if he could not get hold of me he would shoot them instead
3632342 i said i didnt want anything to do with it kevin had been murdered and he said i need help moving stuff out of the briars
3632343 i said i wasnt prepared to do this but he said youre going to help me if you like it or not he pulled out a gun and hit me round the head

3632346 marketing today the competition isnt two doors down the block its at the local mall people can get everything we sell at their local mall so we have to set ourselves apart other ways pay attention to the demographics in your area to the location and available foot traffic to television and movies and what people are wearing on the street
3632347 we have no interest in pursuing at this critical time matters that are not essential to assuring the integrity of the 2008 election
3632348 we are pursuing the organized gangsters led by karl rove who are now poised to apply the same voter suppression tactics corporate funded attack ads and vote destruction and vote flipping tactics they used to steal 2000 and 2004 elections we would agree to an interim relief from the stay which was limited to that purpose
3632349 she has limited personnel who are charged with elections administration these individuals have already worked with her on issuing 60 new directives for 2008 they are busily working on others which will be issued before the november general election their attention is best served working on this instead of aiding defense counsel on charges concerning the 2004 election likewise the secretarys statutory counsel the ohio attorney general also has limited resources counsel for secretary brunner have been busy representing their client in this court as well as others in franklin county their attention is also best served dealing with issues concerning the 2008 election and other matters of importance to the secretary
3632350 simply failed to address why it is necessary to begin litigation at this point instead of waiting three months
3632351 cognizant of the fact that parties to litigation should be allowed to conduct appropriate discovery there is no reason to start discovery at this time
3632352 since this case is already stayed it should remain so for the near term
3632353 its the first time id been a part of a win in a long time
3632354 i didnt think id be as nervous as i was
3632355 i swung at pitches i shouldnt have and took some pitches i probably should have swung at
3632356 we expected dunn to solidify the middle of the order and take some pressure off the other guys
3632357 he did that and solidified the four hole in the lineup
3632358 he gave up the two but after that he was pretty stingy
3632359 just enough mistakes across the board to put us down two runs at the end of the night
3632360 usually you try to lay down a bunt in that situation but not when a guy is throwing 98 and has a pretty good curveball
3632361 i took a swing thinking that anything can happen in this park and it did
3632362 so the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end
3632363 its been a roller coaster ride but as far as me right now im extremely confident
3632364 you play for pressure you play to have all the games count
3632365 ever since i was a little boy i wanted to be in the world series that hasnt happened to me yet when i go to boston i feel like theres a legitimate chance for that to happen this year
3632366 its important to have those guys in for the camp
3632367 things have gone well in the past last year we had some very good players here and in years past were looking forward to having more good high school players here and giving them a good experience
3632368 those guys came through the program and now they are out there playing professional ball so its always good to learn from the professional players

3632373 gregoire does enter this rematch with advantages she is an incumbent in a democratic state in a likely democratic year but she also enters the race with a record how effectively either side is in explaining that record will determine the winner
3632374 i didnt know anything about it until juan pierre said he took all his bats and went on in
3632375 so i said well wed better get him out here
3632376 i was sitting there when manny was forced at the plate and then i realized that i didnt shake mannys hand for getting the hit so he went by me and i put my fist out
3632377 he was probably 8 feet away and he put his fist out and was starting to come back
3632378 and he thought i meant go inside and well pick you up in the ninth
3632379 all the guys said hey we play nine in here
3632380 as far as swinging a club thats not going to happen until next year i just dont have a choice
3632381 we simply dont know what type of swelling there would be or if there would be any residual effects the next day once you start wheeling and dealing on the knee i could putt right now but im not going to do it
3632382 i dont know what the doctors are going to tell me about playing golf down the road im taking it day to day week to week all im doing every day is looking forward to my next day
3632383 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3632384 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3632385 my goggles kept filling up with water during the race
3632386 i wanted a world record i wanted 1 51 or better but in the circumstances not too bad i guess
3632387 they dont win medals at the end of the day unfortunately but it gives me confidence that i can swim my own race under pressure
3632388 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3632389 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat
3632390 yeah i think he picked up a step not just physically but mentally
3632391 whenever you have a first round draft pick it makes you really focus on what youre doing
3632392 ive said it time and time again competition makes us better as a team and i think were seeing the benefits of that
3632393 you will be with people that have great leadership and great discipline
3632394 it will be a very positive experience for our kids and hopefully build our team we think we are a big team but look at the team they have
3632395 we look forward to hosting the wildcats and preparing the team for their fight in the pac 10 this year
3632396 anything we can do to help them train and build their morale and esprit de corps things the army is good at were happy to do
3632397 we wanted to go down there and change up the everyday routine and get around and let them see what we do and watch us practice

3632401 he favors dunking on your head thats what he favors
3632402 i know ive got to keep that in mind and try not to let all the pressure overwhelm me
3632403 for me i dont know if this is the right thing to say but hes yet to play in an nba practice hes yet to play in an nba game so i think the expectations are more on him personally than it is on everybody else
3632404 we know how good he can be but he is still a rookie
3632405 i think a lot of people forgot how good we could have been last year
3632406 a lot of people say this is gregs team i think were a great team and greg is just a great addition

3632410 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3632411 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3632412 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3632413 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3632414 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3632415 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3632416 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3632425 however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing dr rose said
3632426 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying dr rose said
3632427 promoting outdoor activity to parents and families and including more outdoor pursuits in school curricula could be an important public health measure to avoid the development of myopia prof mitchell said

3632619 up until that moment just now i had a big weight on my shoulder
3632620 but i knew i could do it i believed in myself even though a lot of other people were unsure
3632621 m ary s ue and i couldnt have been more proud of emily and all that she accomplished in the past two months
3632622 its truly hard to put into words or to put into perspective
3632623 its painful to live on an island and not be able to have more access to the water than we do
3632624 the world speaks to us in the manner of dreams if well only pay attention
3632625 dreams can show us positivity and possibility the trick is not to leave it hanging loosely
3632626 we found out that the dancers could jump really high
3632627 at that time i was trying to see if i could make it in the country world
3632628 our whole goal was to show all the different styles
3632629 i cant seem to settle on one thing because its all so much fun for me
3632630 i think one day when i grow up maybe ill focus on something but right now the exploring part is fun for me
3632631 id always seen that gallery on the corner but didnt know much about it
3632632 now i can honestly tell you i love that gallery i love the goodwill feeling there
3632633 we want to know that if the measure passes they will be ready to go
3632634 if beer is to be drunk then why not kitsap beer
3632635 the defense of the 18th amendment has therefore become much more than a mere question of regulating the liquor traffic and the fall will bring down with it the dominion of the older civilization
3632636 i think this would be a good time for a beer
3632637 we join with breweries distributors importers and beer lovers all over the u s
3632638 to celebrate and say that enjoying beer is a legal privilege
3632639 after the building went up it was hard for people to tell what was old and what was the new building
3632640 that showed us right away that the integrity of the design had held up
3632641 the piece we havent had here for many years has been a gymnasium a stage and basically a gathering hall where we could bring together our entire community
3632642 they cant wait to play ball here they cant wait to get up on stage and sing
3632643 they have been chomping at the bit watching the building go up
3632644 there are a lot of people who have never known us and have never set foot on our campus
3632645 this will be a great way for them to get to know us
3632646 for us the greatest joy we experience is an athlete overcoming his or her obstacles and having fun at the same time
3632647 the books really pay for themselves after the first couple uses
3632648 our team will receive 40 percent of sales the night of the mctakeover as well as 40 percent of coupon book sales

3632672 the entry and exit of people into and out of australia are matters for the department of immigration

3632680 the agreement with real and the player himself with arsenal is total
3632681 we only need arsene wenger he is the head of it all to give the go ahead to frans departure
3632682 arsenal and their own scout francis cagigao look very favourably at the operation
3632683 i think this issue cannot be expected to last longer than tomorrow we have to solve it this week i hope to be given the go ahead by wenger in the next few hours but i cannot assure you of this because it is something that does not depend on me
3632684 what depends on me is negotiating frans contract and this is already done

3632686 kolo has a hip muscle problem cesc has a hamstring problem he will be out for the next two games
3632687 abou diaby thigh will be out for a while we knew that philippe senderos has a scan on his hamstring he did that today whereas fabregas did his hamstring yesterday
3632688 samir nasri knee thigh should be okay for saturday and so should kolo toure

3632694 the value place brand has truly gained a foothold in florida because consumers whether they are business travelers or families on vacation crave an economical place to stay without sacrificing quality
3632695 our customers have the confidence that they will find just that every time they check into a value place hotel thus providing the impetus for us to grow the brand in this desirable destination
3632696 even though i loved the game i didnt see a way how i could continue playing in college i was ready to find a job take a few classes here and there get a degree and then get a real job
3632697 the open gym is great because it helps me stay focused on my goal
3632698 without it no telling what i would get into this on the other hand is a positive place a spot place where i can try get a scholarship somewhere
3632699 since were a division ii school we have a few scholarship dollars available where we can make an offer to a guy who is like that diamond in the rough
3632700 they liked how i played and made the offer after the scrimmage
3632701 but i need an invitation to get a tryout playing overseas will help me in that way thats why i come here and work out
3632702 i was probably at the lowest point in my life in terms of my basketball career
3632703 brian is a high energy player who is an athletic defender and rebounder
3632704 i am really excited to have brian in the program he was under the recruiting radar because of his injury but his work ethic attitude and competitive nature will be a major asset to our team
3632705 he just needed a little encouragement he could have given up yet he kept the faith worked his butt off and now he is going to fresno state
3632706 and thats what its all about seeing guys work hard and move on is like getting paid a million bucks you like to see them overcome adversity so far seals and graves have the question is who will be next
3632707 it was my dream just to be in the individual final to be fourth or fifth
3632708 she was a kid that really stuck to it that impressed me from the beginning shes always been that way
3632709 we gave her a good start but its also due to her perseverance and skill
3632710 it was a great group of girls overall they were just really dedicated young horsewomen
3632711 its almost a huge dream fulfilled for the whole club
3632712 i always knew he mckinlaigh was the best event horse in the world
3632713 he had his day to shine at the olympic games
3632714 shes a really nice gal she explains things very nicely i recommend her to folks
3632715 its kind of nice for the kids in this area
3632716 it will have a domino effect a ripple effect certainly these arent going to be people new to riding these are going to be people who are already experienced
3632717 horse people may look to eventing to provide a new experience
3632718 its almost a lifestyle people are born into it the kids here have to work at it
3632719 for her to accomplish this it gives me goose bumps
3632720 its a great way to get kids into the sport
3632721 when they can actually meet someone face to face thats been to the olympics it gives them the ambition to push harder because they can see that they can do that as well
3632722 we lucked out she turned out to be a great pony to get started on we didnt have any of the equipment we sort of found our way through
3632723 i calmed down once i heard what they had to say
3632724 once jerry blevins got me out of that jam i knew we were going to win
3632725 in the case of promart we think the funding choices made were inappropriate inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases with highly ideological individuals exposing their agendas or money going to wealthy celebrities or fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
3632726 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3632727 this is just another distraction to keep the niner fans from focusing on the real issue on the niners their lack of a quality qb
3632728 we plan on getting the baseball program started for the 2010 2011 school year
3632729 we have to build a budget and we have to have a budget to build
3632730 but we still plan on starting in 2010 we thought we had a guy who would have been ideal so well see how the economy and the schools budget sits when were ready to progress
3632731 pitchers usually dominate in the spring because they are in camp earlier and thus longer their arms are fresh and their legs strong
3632732 when you get around to this time of the year its usually the other way around pitchers have thrown 120 130 innings and they are not likely to be as strong its more possible for them to maintain than it is to get better
3632733 if you watched the countries marching in during opening ceremonies you had to say wait a minute
3632734 you expect everyone to have women in their delegation but when they dont we barely pause its so ingrained its almost like thats the way it is supposed to be
3632735 while i was working on a report about human rights and child marriages it struck me we are the only country in the world that does not allow women to play any sport
3632736 even iran for example has thriving female sports organizations and leagues qatar is starting female sports teams somalia afghanistan iraq offer something but not my country and this disgusts me more disgusting is the silence of the west to be honest
3632737 i asked my mother what if you had a daughter who wanted to be a gymnast
3632738 she said they are not wearing clothes i dont think she had a problem with the women competing but the way i feel why i do this is that i have always been an activist on human rights and i believe that if you allow women to play sports womens rights everywhere will be much improved
3632739 tolan clark florence has a daughter dorothy tyler florence 9 pounds 19 inches born 9 8 08 at 8 08 am she is perfect
3632740 the only thing i was ever told by my mother was that of six previous children my dad was not involved in naming any of them so he supposedly tried to catch up using me he named me after a president a roman emperor and an indian chief being part indian i guess he felt he had to get an indian name in there somewhere ive always claimed he had to be in the firewater to give a kid a name like that

3632746 we remain bullish on gold with a 2009 price forecast of us 950 oz driven by a return of fabrication demand after the price correction wealth effects in developing nations and negative real interest rates
3632747 the underlying driver of commodity intensive infrastructure investment in developing countries remains unchanged short term risks remain but the opportunities are there for investors corporates that can look through the haze of negativity
3632748 the super cycle bull market for commodity stocks that has been underway since early this decade has not been a one way street with a number of meaningful corrections that have tested the resolve of the market
3632749 trading these spikes and troughs in the mining stocks is not without risks but is undeniably a highly rewarding strategy for those that are nimble enough and have the courage to look through the current negative haze surrounding the sector
3632750 the only reason for not stepping up and buying the sector after this recent correction is a belief that the cycle is not well and truly over and commodity prices will fall further
3632751 this point is critical as china is after all the key driver of the commodity super cycle
3632752 economic policy post the olympics will be key it seems likely that the government will continue to selectively stimulate
3632753 with a number of commodities entering price levels where china has traditionally restocked particularly copper we expect to see a strong rebound in prices and stocks in 4q08 and 2009
3632754 our commodity team forecasts very bullish 2009 commodity prices that drive very strong earnings growth for the stocks and consequentially very attractive pe multiples and discounts to valuation that look very appealing
3632755 a potential silver lining in the otherwise gloom cloud handing over markets could be the abatement of costs pressures
3632756 highly exposed to the a will be enjoying the respite as it has fallen back below 90 cents
3632757 speculative money exiting base metals gold is amplifying volatility but spot bulk prices reflect underlying demand and remain above contract prices and our 2009 as the northern hemisphere awakens from its summer slumber and any real perceived china olympics related weakness unwinds we expect the stocks to rally in the 4q

3632765 i thought the audience walked out on the high film frame rate because it was too realistic now youre saying they cant tell the difference must have been an audience of supermen eh
3632766 the point where you cant tell the difference anymore is somewhere over 72 fps
3632767 personally i hate the jerky 24 fps film look id take 60 or 72 fps any day

3632772 the company faces significant financial obligations in the second half of 2008 and during 2009 that are expected to exceed available funding sources the company projects that an additional 125 million in funding will be required from august 2008 through 2009
3632773 the company does not expect san crist bal to achieve completion by year end 2008 as required by the minera san crist bal project finance facility failure to achieve completion would constitute an event of default under the facility entitling the lenders to accelerate repayment of all indebtedness and derivative liabilities and could also result in a default under the companys convertible notes

3632793 it was always going to be the case with fuelwatch and im particularly unsurprised about the comments from mr xenophon this morning
3632794 of course in the lead up to the vote in the senate we will be taking senator xenophon up on his offer of discussion and if theres anything he can propose that meets his concerns while meeting the fundamental policy aims of the government to get more transparency in the petrol market and get rid of what is effectively collusion in the market we will be happy to talk that through
3632795 there are severe criminal penalties for collusion and on that basis we strongly suggest that any suggestion of collusion in the petrol market be supported by factual evidence rather than throwing around baseless accusations
3632796 we support more information being provided to the consumer and we acknowledge that the average motoring consumer may not understand the different elements that make up the price of petrol at the pump let alone many of the products they pick up off the grocery shelf
3632797 but this lack of information should not be confused with transparency
3632798 why should the motorists of australia not have access to the same price information that the good motorists of western australia have had for many years mr rudd said
3632799 the liberals are the ones who control this in the senate and what the liberals have done federally is to side with big oil companies against consumers
3632800 it is the liberals who decide what happens in the senate theyve decided that they will back big oil companies rather than give information to consumers like motorists have had in this state for many years
3632801 we will continue to argue for fuelwatch well wait and see what happens
3632802 i mean nick xenophon with due respect hasnt yet been sworn in as a senator hasnt yet sat there in the senate
3632803 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3632804 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3632805 youre dealing with the majors theyre big bureaucracies theyre slow
3632806 yes theyve got enormous power but a quick nimble independent can work around them
3632807 you 2 of my friends died passed out drunk on their mothers lawn
3632808 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry
3632809 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
3632810 russia now flush with cash wants to rebuild its 19th century imperial sphere of influence in the former soviet union
3632811 it also wants to make an example out of georgia to other nato aspirants what the chinese call kill the chicken to take care of the monkey so the ukrainians will think russia would use force to prevent them from joining nato
3632812 i didnt write this wikipedia entry it may look like i did but i didnt im a published writer so its not inconceivable that one of my many hot young fans citation needed wrote this ill look it over though just to make sure everythings accurate yup looks good
3632813 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3632814 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3632815 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3632816 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3632817 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions

3632831 we didnt even have maps there was a guy with me they didnt give him a machinegun it turns out that they hadnt even registered him with the unit before they shipped him out here today our commander sent him back to vladikavkaz
3632832 they didnt even tell us there was a war on
3632833 i dont understand why they put the russians first in the column and us at the end it was always the other way around and we were supposed to be first this time too then the losses wouldnt have been so great
3632834 yamadaev our commander he is with us all the time
3632835 they were simply better by a head than all the rest they didnt have a single loss
3632836 they transferred us here several months ago only trained soldiers should fight here its a complicated place
3632837 if it is a civilian we transfer them to hospitals in north ossetia or other regions you know all the regions have responded and are ready to take in the victims
3632838 well i dont know the numbers im a doctor not a politician here theyre bringing a wounded georgian to me now well treat him like all the others
3632839 but now they say the war is over putin said so
3632840 they always betrayed us gorbachev yeltsin we thought putin would hand us over to the georgians too what took the russians so long to get here no one believed they were coming between bombings we ran out of the cellar and looked at the council of ministers building the russian and ossetian flags were flying we saw that if our flag is flying it means the city is ours then we heard tanks coming with squeaky tracks i thought russians i went up and heard georgian being spoken
3632841 being a russian sleeper spy and must elude capture long enough to establish her innocence
3632842 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3632843 opening a medical spa or adding a medical spa to a medical practice can be very lucrative and rewarding but offering medspa services doesnt guarantee success
3632844 i am often shocked by the suggestions of so called expert consultants who dont own medical spas what looks good on paper may not work in the real world cheap technology that isnt safe effective and consistent wont bring back clients
3632845 i am also astonished by those who suggest sales quotas and commission only compensation for staff this will not work long term period
3632846 what makes kiles presentations unique is that she is a medpsa owner who has followed her owned recipe for success she is not simply a consultant without a medspa it is refreshing to learn from someone without a hidden agenda kile is not selling medspa consulting services a medspa franchise or products her honesty is refreshing and her information is easy to apply to your own medical spa
3632847 i want to see other medical spas achieve success i will share basic building blocks of success that are applicable to any medical spa business of any size in any market and i will answer any and all questions in the q amp a portion of the presentation
3632848 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3632849 the media continues to hammer the message of planning for your financial retirement when there are so many non financial issues to be considered including at what age do you retire do you continue working do you relocate consider wellness issues etc
3632850 a childs first year in school is a unique time for working moms
3632851 this is a new horizon for kids and another level of commitment and nurturing for working moms and dads because we want to provide all the support we can and still meet the demands of the workplace i vowed that i would share my kindergarten journey with other parents and here it is
3632852 should i home school private school stay at home work part time flex time or no time
3632853 the one thing that i want working moms to take away from corporate to kindergarten is that there is a light at the end of the tunnel even when hard choices and sacrifices have to be made along the way thats what i learned during our kindergarten year in school
3632854 tas le droit davoir des graine de cannabis mais attention tu nas pas le droit de les faire pousser
3632855 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
3632856 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3632857 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3632858 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3632859 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3632860 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3632861 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3632862 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3632863 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3632864 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3632865 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
3632866 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
3632867 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
3632868 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3632869 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3632870 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3632871 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3632872 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3632873 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3632874 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
3632875 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
3632876 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
3632877 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
3632878 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
3632879 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3632880 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3632881 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3632882 hope i know its taken us a long time to get here we even thought at times that we wouldnt i know i had my doubts i never thought i could have someone in my life that could make me so happy or make me feel so alive you know how hard it is for me to tell people how i feel about them especially people i care about but today in front of all these people i have no problem telling you that i love you i know our lives arent going to be sunshine and roses from here on in but im going to try my hardest to keep our love alive weve got something very special here its worth fighting for i love you hope
3632883 oh bo i fell in love with you the first time i saw you but its taken all that time to realize that what i felt then is nothing compared to what i feel now
3632884 true love is the gift which god hath given to man alone beneath the heavens
3632885 twenty four years have gone but you know what i look into your eyes and i see the man i fell in love with when i was just a girl the man who never fails to surprise me even now the man who makes my heart flutter with just a look or a touch and he drives me absolutely insane with the way he does things but then i remember that was one of the reasons i fell in love with him always honesty and integrity youve always had the courage to follow your heart and trust in me what im trying to say youre my hero youve always been my hero and i know that whatever lies ahead well be together well stand by each other to you my soul mate my partner my husband i love you brady i love you
3632886 i still want only you and need only you i dont deserve you and i thank god that youre standing by my side and that you stay by my side even when thats not easy to do your belief and your faith in me has made me the man i am today a man i can be proud of even when thats not so easy to do
3632887 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

3632893 but it wasnt easy to put that race behind me

3632906 this mouse model is the first platform to understand how the brain cell deterioration takes place we will use this model to identify targets for new drugs to slow or prevent the disease
3632907 this is a crucial breakthrough for scientists fighting lewy body disease further research using these models will enable us to find new drug targets
3632908 it is because of the astonishing generosity of telegraph readers that this research came to fruition we cannot thank the newspaper and its readers enough for their extraordinary munificence
3632909 musharraf has continued to cling to the office of the president defying the clear verdict of the nation in the february 18 elections the people had voted against his dictatorship and steps taken on november 3 2007
3632910 since the supreme court was prevented by the illegal removal from office of judges who refused to take oath under pco from ruling on the validity of general musharrafs election in october 2007 we support the governments decision to impeach him under article 47 of the constitution and call upon the government to bring these proceedings to a speedy conclusion
3632911 we call upon the government to take these steps simultaneously with the commencement of the impeachment proceedings rather than after their conclusion
3632912 the department of health has made it clear in the draft nhs constitution that it expects pcts to make funding decisions in a rational and transparent manner
3632913 its difficult to see how this can be achieved if a pct does not even have a written policy on how it will make such decisions
3632914 it is very difficult for patients and clinicians to formulate requests for funding if they dont know how the requests for drugs are assessed
3632915 we look at each funding request on an individual patient basis and consider the matter in the light of each case
3632916 apart from information provided on our exceptional case form we often have further discussions with the patients consultant to ensure all information has been provided before an assessment of that individual patient is made
3632917 we are currently reviewing all procedures relating to special cases to ensure fair and prompt consideration for patients is timely
3632918 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3632919 look at them they have the little bitty baby teeth
3632920 its as big a problem as doping it is more blatant cheating than doping its a slap in the face to the whole world shame on them but theres nothing you can do about it
3632921 the only thing they can do is abolish the age limit

3632924 it was not the most serious case of sexual assault i can imagine but what i want to do is prevent this happening in the future
3632925 it has been amazing but i am disappointed with our performance
3632926 i feel we are much better than eighth and it is just a shame that at the olympics it didnt come together but everything else about the olympics has been massive and amazing
3632927 i was a little nervous but just as normal as i was so prepared for the olympics
3632928 who said it went wrong it was our first olympic games
3632929 i will be supporting the rest of my team in the other events and the rest of team gb when and where i can and ill be coming home after the closing ceremony
3632930 i have the world championships next year but the nationals in february is where ill compete first again after my break
3632931 they were quite impressive looking blokes actually they didnt look like the sort of people you want to mess with
3632932 at first i thought they were community policemen because they were dressed in blue but then i saw they had uk border and immigration written on their backs
3632933 i saw two of them escorting someone back to the building so obviously he had made a run for it and they took him back inside
3632934 kom we sturen ze naar t arbeidsbureau om een vacature ala dealer in te laten vullen

3632941 we want to train our students to be ready for the working environment they will face in the future as a result apiit students have better chances of getting employment

3632944 shes a beautiful beautiful beautiful person in a very ugly position and i really feel for her
3632945 i think that i really have never known someone so insistent upon integrity and honesty and openness
3632946 but someone who has an affair with a married man you say has integrity and honesty
3632947 i think she thought that he had quite a bit of integrity and i think that that appealed to her about him sometimes we make mistakes sometimes we pick people to fall in love with that maybe arent the greatest choice at the time i cant judge her in that i cant fault her in that
3632948 a very keenly intellectually engaged woman shes very insistent upon rigorous dialogue
3632949 we lost touch in about may or june of 06 right before she began work on the webisodes i think she was gearing up to really engage in the big piece of work that she was doing for him so her head was in a different space

3632951 government is not the solution to our problems government is the problem
3632952 the legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and ultimately if they choose they may become americans

3632976 when we did the first climate change computer models we thought the arctics summer ice cover would last until around 2070
3632977 it is now clear we did not understand how thin the ice cap had already become for arctic ice cover has since been disappearing at ever increasing rates every few years we have to revise our estimates downwards now the most detailed computer models suggest the arctics summer ice is going to last for only a few more years and given what we have seen happen last week i think they are probably correct
3632978 it does not really matter whether 2007 or 2008 is the worst year on record for arctic ice maslowski said the crucial point is that ice is clearly not building up enough over winter to restore cover and that when you combine current estimates of ice thickness with the extent of the ice cap you get a very clear indication that the arctic is going to be ice free in summer in five years and when that happens there will be consequences
3632979 the trouble is that sea ice is now disappearing from the arctic faster than our ability to develop new computer models and to understand what is happening there we always knew it would be the first region on earth to feel the impact of climate change but not at anything like this speed what is happening now indicates that global warming is occurring far earlier than any of us expected

3632988 its the worst restaurant climate ive seen in my 26 years in the food and wine business
3632989 people who were going out three or four times now were only going out once not ordering wine or dessert
3632990 the renovations we implemented turned it into an effective restaurant space
3632991 a new operator with a new vision for the place could do really well
3632992 this is going to be different not like other hotels
3632993 with most hotels the restaurant is secondary and with this one the restaurant comes first

3632996 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3632997 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3632998 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored

3633018 er ist ein held es gibt keinen zweifel dass er der gr te olympionike der geschichte ist wir als weltverband sind unheimlich stolz auf michael phelps alle anderen athleten schauen bewundernd zu ihm auf
3633019 es ist fantastisch das ist ein neues zeitalter im schwimmen ein v llig neues niveau neue anz ge eine neue generation es ist nicht zu fassen

3633021 von den ergebnissen her ist michael phelps sicherlich der gr te aber ich bin baff dass einer der schon vor jahren so unglaubliche zeiten erzielt hat sich weiter in diesem ausma steigern kann
3633022 wir bef rchten dass dies unsere athleten ernsthaft beeintr chtigt
3633023 ich wurde hier schon viermal getestet und mir wurde blut abgenommen eine menge blut wir werden vor dem finale ber 100 m sehr schwach sein

3633025 distinguierte kommentatoren und westliche regierungen rufen nach transatlantischer geschlossenheit gegen ber dem russischen angriff aber es ist unklar was diese transatlantische geschlossenheit bedeuten soll soll die nato truppen nach tiflis schicken ein mutiger und kreativer schritt vielleicht aber sehr unwahrscheinlich wenn man an westeuropas abneigung gegen ber waffen denkt oder m chte irgendjemand ernsthaft ber ein szenario nachdenken in dem die vereinigten staaten und russland in kampfhandlungen gegeneinander verwickelt sind die wahrheit ist russland hat durchschaut dass der westen im fall georgiens nur bluffte und das spiel gewonnen
3633026 russland hat jetzt die totale kontrolle ber die separatistengebiete selbst wenn die amerikaner und die europ er ihren druck erh hen damit georgien die souver nit t ber sein gebiet zur ckerh lt werden sie moskau nicht viel aufzwingen der georgische traum eines beitritts zur nato scheint sich im rauch dieses krieges zu verfl chtigen die wichtigsten europ ischen l nder die sich bereits mit h nden und f en gegen diese perspektive gestemmt hatten werden sich in ihrer haltung best tigt sehen die russische antwort war nebenbei genau berechnet um die europ er zum nachdenken zu bringen dieser konflikt brachte damit eine traurige best tigung wenn nichts getan wird k nnte europa nach einer zeit der befriedung wieder ein ort der harten konfrontation der m chte werden
3633027 russland hat bei der abwehr des georgischen angriffs auf s dossetien die kriegshandlungen viel l nger fortgesetzt und ist viel tiefer auf georgisches territorium vorgedrungen als n tig war um die georgischen truppen aus der enklave zur ckzudr ngen der russische pr sident medwedew hat vorw rfe zur ckgewiesen dass russland in georgien einen regimewechsel herbeif hren m chte doch es ist jetzt nicht mehr erforderlich den georgischen pr sidenten michail saakaschwili abzusetzen russlands kaum angefochtene milit raktion in georgien hat moskau wieder einmal als unangefochtenen herren der region etabliert die roten linien eines neuen gleichgewichts der macht sind gezogen worden

3633125 owing to a belief that there was a potential threat to life the firearms support unit was called to assist with the control of the incident
3633126 sometimes we forget about them the rebels every day they say they are fighting for the poor people of darfur and yet what have they done to show even interest to go to the conference table
3633127 i am not in any way saying that the khartoum government is clean but what i am saying is that also the other side cannot be said to be saints so my appeal is that the pressure should be exerted on both sides
3633128 they will have to end on a negotiation table because militarily its clear no side can win the war in darfur
3633129 but if you have 15 20 parties wanting to go to conference table to talk nothing will come out of it

3633132 this data allows investigators to identify suspects examine their contacts establish relationships between conspirators and place them in a specific location at a certain time
3633133 it also gives investigators the potential to identify other forensic opportunities identify witnesses and premises of evidential interest many alibis are proven or refuted through the use of communications data without the ec directive investigative opportunities will be increasingly lost
3633134 we will be told it is for use in combating terrorism and organised crime but if ripa powers are anything to go by it will soon be used to spy on ordinary peoples kids pets and bins
3633135 yet again the government have proved themselves unable to resist the temptation to take a power quite properly designed to combat terrorism to snoop on the lives of ordinary people in everyday circumstances

3633168 hes a guy whose message has met the right moment
3633169 you know that i never endorse nor campaign for political candidates neither is it my role to give political advice but i am a cultural observer and i do understand the unique stresses and responsibilities of public leadership so i try to help leaders when asked
3633170 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd
3633171 he is threatening to water down the essential message of evangelical christianity
3633172 and that is what causes people to grow a little insecure and concerned and maybe even disconcerted
3633173 ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3633174 american made motorcycles like harleys dont matter to john mccain

3633180 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3633181 in true hollywood style with lots of action and magic
3633182 i always believe you work hard and you play hard and i think this will inspire everyone to work hard
3633183 i will not go on vacation i will not leave the state i will not do anything until i have a budget
3633184 they have been very busy working on hundreds of different bills that have nothing to do with the budget
3633185 if the governor feels like he can go to the border governors conference and still negotiate the budget then go ahead
3633186 i think the reason the governor is frustrated is because he actually has to sit in the building and figure it out with us
3633187 the more hes out of the capital or out of the state the more his critics can say look arnold is traveling all over while california workers are being asked to take a huge pay cut
3633188 roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3633189 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and his values
3633190 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3633191 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to our backgrounds
3633192 she focused primarily on issues that mattered to working families this was a strategy that was not employed discussed by senior staff or even pushed by mark penn
3633193 even if you concluded it would be a useful line of attack some of us were queasy about it
3633194 its fair to say that most people thought it would really rebound on her
3633195 the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century
3633196 many people believe under the surface that 20 years sitting there with goddamn america would make obama unelectable by itself
3633197 what does that say about his leadership that he never left or complained
3633198 we are in for a real fight but assuming she at least achieves the projections for tuesday and given some breaks it is a fight that she can win
3633199 soon many common everyday products could disappear from grocery store shelves all across california

3633201 the possibility that bisphenol a may impact human development cannot be dismissed
3633202 bpa cant be unharmful if industry is going out of its way to remove it
3633203 these arent charitably minded corporations theyre thinking about their bottom line

3633206 conduct performance audits of all departments and may conduct performance audits of city programs including suggesting plans for the improvement and management of the revenues and expenditures of the city
3633207 i would absolutely be willing to allow the public to decide
3633208 its fodder for talk shows but does it accomplish anything
3633209 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3633210 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3633211 the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability
3633212 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3633213 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3633214 further there would be no munition fragments that could be used to identify the source of the strike

3633223 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3633224 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3633225 we were going to be wearing thongs but the stylist snipped them off here we are keira and i and were totally naked and some guy is on his blackberry computer everyone was busy working but i guess its better than if they were all looking at me it was surprisingly comfortable
3633226 it gives those agencies carte blanche to do what they want
3633227 its not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3633228 its ridiculous to admit that something is endangered because of climate change and then say the law doesnt apply to climate change
3633229 the bush administration is trying to do by regulation what they cant do by legislation

3633233 shes a beautiful beautiful beautiful person in a very ugly position and i really feel for her
3633234 i think that i really have never known someone so insistent upon integrity and honesty and openness
3633235 but someone who has an affair with a married man you say has integrity and honesty
3633236 i think she thought that he had quite a bit of integrity and i think that that appealed to her about him sometimes we make mistakes sometimes we pick people to fall in love with that maybe arent the greatest choice at the time i cant judge her in that i cant fault her in that
3633237 a very keenly intellectually engaged woman shes very insistent upon rigorous dialogue
3633238 we lost touch in about may or june of 06 right before she began work on the webisodes i think she was gearing up to really engage in the big piece of work that she was doing for him so her head was in a different space
3633239 engaged in the business of discovering and developing artists in the music industry
3633240 hier kan je uitgebreid na gaan denken over wat je wil gaan zeggen
3633241 allee ik moest bellen want de klop doet het niet
3633242 i believe that we need to create a special committee in the u s senate to exercise oversight over contracting abuses related to reconstruction and the wars in iraq and afghanistan
3633243 i still believe that we need to establish a bipartisan truman committee with subpoena power to exercise the oversight that these abuses demand
3633244 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
3633245 the only result of the use of air strikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism if the international community focuses on the terrorists bases hideouts and places where they are being trained and financed the problem is going to solved
3633246 i cannot foresee a winning outcome in afghanistan without resolving the sanctuaries in the tribal areas of pakistan
3633247 i cant see a viable level of afghan government authority developing here while there are still all these militant sanctuaries across the border
3633248 out of a responsibility and respect for the victims of the holocaust
3633249 we have to prepare our contemporaries for the release of mein kampf
3633250 we have to supply them with objective arguments and give them the ability to hold their own in the political and publicity debate
3633251 an aggressive and enlightened way of dealing with the book would undoubtedly divest it of much of the myth that so unjustly surrounds it
3633252 fail to add to our understanding of such things as the holocaust or the elation with which many people followed the nazi rule it wouldnt even reach those supposedly benefiting from it the man in the street
3633253 your average joe just isnt interested in such a publication
3633254 at least i havent met anybody yet in the subway or wherever who has begged for one
3633255 the text is easily available abroad and on the internet
3633256 nobody can prevent people from quoting it or using it for illegal purposes and an edition like the one some people now call for wont change that
3633257 we are entering a new phase if they conduct an investigation on the assumption that there are survivors
3633258 they could make what they do look great if they showed results in the probe into the abductions and at the same time come up with the right moves on the nuclear issue
3633259 i hope that the investigation will be carried out thoroughly and lead to the swift return of the victims
3633260 if japan breaks this agreement all would collapse we will also take necessary measures
3633261 mukasey used his sharpest words yet to criticize the senior leaders who took part in or failed to stop illegal hiring practices during the tenure of his predecessor alberto gonzales
3633262 the rule of law in its most basic form is the principle that no one is above the law
3633263 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3633264 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3633265 singapore like all asean countries is committed to the principle that asean should be at the center of any regional architecture all asean dialogue partners have supported this principle prime minister rudds proposal appears to be a departure from australias previous position
3633266 obviously you do not care much about greece or cyprus for greece will never fight a war with turkey
3633267 it was just a matter of time and when and where weve been plugging at it since 2004 so to under is a good relief
3633268 the meaning of my post was to compare policies the policy of a state with military power turkey and a micky mouse state cyprus
3633269 income growth is robust and theres no sign that inflation has eroded consumers purchasing power
3633270 i really struggled getting in i am so glad i put it out there this morning its really good being next to natalie coughlin she pushed me through the first 100
3633271 what came into my mind when i won i was saying finally finally i have been expecting to win the last four years
3633272 i couldnt see anything for the last 100 my goggles pretty much filled up with water
3633273 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest but its fine i wanted to break the record i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3633274 really scarlett and i have run out of lines to say about that
3633275 when you commit a reckless act and bad things happen you have to be accountable for it
3633276 but im sure hes not as heartsick as i am
3633277 obviously you do not care much about greece or cyprus for greece will never fight a war with turkey
3633278 the meaning of my post was to compare policies the policy of a state with military power turkey and a micky mouse state cyprus
3633279 its not age per se that when you get to 80 its all over with
3633280 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
3633281 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems
3633282 anxiety is very clearly a big factor in sexual dysfunction for women and depression in men
3633283 and men can become very depressed because of sexual dysfunction
3633284 banyak kasus seperti itu seperti bob hasan atau tommy soeharto di nusakambangan tetap saja ada perlakuan khusus

3633288 i basically said heres my boring life on saturday nights its a double feature with my parents dinner and a movie
3633289 i was just tired of going out to bars to meet guys
3633290 rob now 29 said he had been looking at rings but couldnt decide on the right one kelly now 27 had worn her late grandmothers engagement ring on her right hand since the third grade that night the couple put it on her left hand and made plans to go ring shopping
3633291 i was very calm and had it together for most of the day but during the vows i got choked up
3633292 that was the most important part of the day for us
3633293 its a struggle going off to college not having your mother help you unpack
3633294 it was a struggle to focus to not think about her and the way that she died
3633295 i want to be the one to solve these cases
3633296 i think i started to learn how to motivate myself
3633297 it kind of felt good to do it for her because i couldnt do it for myself
3633298 im struggling to take care of myself and my sister financially and make sure we have what we need to continue in life
3633299 just to have something that we can call our own

3633304 i think itll cost a lot more money but pretty soon everything will be electronic and itll be easier on the volunteers

3633306 we face all of these teams that were going to play here we can play at that level we know we belong at this level and we want to perform a 1 1 draw is a point but we are disappointed we didnt put our best performance out there
3633307 we start at a younger age in that area its a little more well known when kids are growing up as opposed to soccer in other areas
3633308 were making leaps and bounds as far as our skill level goes
3633309 these young kids are the ones who are holding the standard for the group theyre kind of pushing us older kids
3633310 to have us back in the games as a female sport is phenomenal

3633348 youre dealing with raw truth and believe it or not country and western and soul music are first cousins because its the voice of the common folk
3633349 in a way im saying look at me im a self centred narcissistic western woman
3633350 but im allowing the audience to see that i do it on purpose in order to shift the game a bit
3633351 and whether we speak the same language across cultures and nationalities
3633352 having made very intimate films about other people in the past i began to think with this film i cannot pretend to be out of the story
3633353 filming myself suddenly seemed like the only way out of my depression whats a more perfect mirror than a video camera
3633354 i thought ok i will use myself as a guinea pig after all how could i ask another woman to go on the line if i wasnt prepared to go on the line myself
3633355 oh god shes not going to bang on about her love triangle again is she
3633356 we say let me share let me tell let me listen to something about you
3633357 we have seen many many films about those poor women in pakistan and those poor somali women and those poor cambodian prostitutes without the film maker in what i wanted to say even if i do it crudely even if im not entirely successful is that its a lie to say theres no connection to us i wanted to say its about us not them its not true that that a woman in pakistan has no connection to me in new york or you in britain
3633358 sometimes one should be incredibly distant and sometimes you should merge with your material which is what ive done but even when one is incredibly distant i really believe that most authored documentaries are incredibly autobiographical
3633359 its a lie to say that were objective we all strive for it but there is no such thing
3633360 i like the way male middle aged tv executives are embarrassed by them i find it deeply gratifying to see them squirming in their seats when theyre watching them
3633361 i think you could do good confessions or bad confessions documentary isnt de facto worthy we always try to buck this trend in fact we say you should enjoy storyville as you would grazia or the independent theres no difference
3633362 it changed me and my relationship with the women in my family because ironically from the narcissism of self observation what i actually got was a larger picture of the world i suddenly wasnt unique in looking at my navel
3633363 you will be with people that have great leadership and great discipline
3633364 it will be a very positive experience for our kids and hopefully build our team we think we are a big team but look at the team they have

3633366 anything we can do to help them train and build their morale and esprit de corps things the army is good at were happy to do

3633425 we need to be on the lookout for overcare an emotional habit that people commonly resort to when things are feeling unstable people can think that if theyre not worrying or obsessing over a person situation or outcome it must mean theyre not caring enough the need to worry or obsess is really just a mental and emotional habit it is possible to find an inner peace and security during stressful circumstances the stronger our foundation of inner security the more resilient we are the quicker we can recover from overcare and feelings of worry stress and anxiety and the less well drain our precious inner resources
3633426 overcare is often disguised as angst worry concern sympathy or even sentiment and can lead to stress related health issues such as headaches backaches digestive issues and hormonal imbalances although both men and women can experience overcare and related physical complaints our society tends to train and expect women to be caregivers so they tend to be more prone to overcaring about people or situations

3633443 i hope we can find a way to get the glass and plastic recycled in addition to the paper and metal we need to do what we can to make the program work
3633444 we want to make all of our research available to city officials so they can make informed decisions as they move forward
3633445 if we are going to spend that much money on recycling i think we really need to take a look at how well the program is working
3633446 right now there is no market for the glass but we are looking for a new market for it i think we are doing a good job with our metal and paper
3633447 the plan is only as good as your execution and right now we are not executing the recycling plan very well
3633448 if we reduce the waste stream by increasing recycling we can reduce the amount of taxpayer money our city pays in tipping fees to the landfill and use that money for other projects
3633449 we are also looking at ways we can reduce waste and make use of alternative energy

3633451 he had the greatest legal mind ive ever had the experience to be around he was the model judge in terms of intellect industry compassion and temperament there wasnt anybody better

3633453 he taught everyone he worked with so much about the preparation and trial of a lawsuit
3633454 his many opinions on the court were always thoroughly researched and beautifully written in the area of injury law and civil procedure many of his opinions became nationally recognized there are mighty few lawyers in our state as able as tom miller and he will be greatly missed by many of us
3633455 justice thomas miller will always be for me the epitome of what a judge should be
3633456 he had a brilliant mind a compassionate spirit and a heart of fairness
3633457 his impact on the development of the law in west virginia is immense on a personal level he was a mentor to me he was kind and gracious and he and wife vaughn were dear friends justice franklin cleckley once called tom miller the greatest justice to ever serve on the west virginia supreme court and i am so grateful for the time i was privileged to serve with him
3633458 he was the epitome of what a justice should be simply a wonderful man decent honorable professional at all times a perfect gentleman

3633490 a decline in courage may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society of course there are many courageous individuals but they have no determining influence on public life political and intellectual bureaucrats show depression passivity and perplexity in their actions and in their statements and even more so in theoretical reflections to explain how realistic reasonable as well as intellectually and even morally warranted it is to base state policies on weakness and cowardice and decline in courage is ironically emphasized by occasional explosions of anger and inflexibility on the part of the same bureaucrats when dealing with weak governments and weak countries not supported by anyone or with currents which cannot offer any resistance but they get tongue tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces with aggressors and international terrorists should one point out that from ancient times decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end
3633491 im saying thats a personal problem you need to address on your own
3633492 lets see how long it takes jenny to realize i sent the text message to someone else and not her boy is it pathetic how frequently she keeps looking at her phone and waiting

3633495 a study by two economists that argues that drilling in anwr would produce an immediate drop in oil prices even if the oil did not enter refineries for several years interestingly this study was the energy journal not because they disagreed with the findings but because they considered the studys conclusion so obvious that it was not worth publishing
3633496 the bush administration wants americans to believe that drilling in the arctic refuge and off our coastlines will ease our pain at the gas pump in reality it would lower gas prices by mere pennies and that would be 20 years from now
3633497 the arctic national wildlife refuge with its varied and sensitive ecosystems should be preserved that pristine area must remain off limits
3633498 in short there could be much more oil under the sea than previously known
3633499 with oil prices still above 100 a barrel that charge never made sense
3633500 between 1993 and 2007 there were 651 spills of all sizes at ocs facilities in federal waters three miles or more offshore that released 47 800 barrels of oil with 7 5 billion barrels of oil produced in that time that equates to 1 barrel of oil spilled per 156 900 barrels produced thats not to minimize the danger but no form of energy is perfect or without trade offs besides if it is acceptable to drill in the caspian sea and in developing countries such as nigeria where environmental concerns are equally important its hard to explain why the united states should rule out drilling off its own coasts
3633501 i feel very excited because we sacrificed a lot to win this gold medal and this is a direct competition between the chinese team and the usa team and we are very proud that we won
3633502 i didnt expect this medal my coach told me that even eighth place would be okay
3633503 other swimmers have endurance but my advantage is speed i gave it all that i had hopefully the bronze medal will encourage our team
3633504 given their growing market share and growing service revenue per user its clear customers do see value

3633510 as an essendon supporter growing up i used to enjoy it beating adelaide
3633511 weve spoken a bit about the history of that it doesnt mean we cant beat them
3633512 we can if we want to and if weve got more desire and determination hopefully we come away with a win
3633513 last year we didnt play too good over there and i suppose they wanted it more their contested ball and tackling was better than ours they moved it better but this seasons a different season and were looking forward to the contest
3633514 us four young ruckmen this year have been really good at looking forward to contests like that hille
3633515 the attitude we go in with is to learn from those experiences and if we get beaten learn from it if we beat him learn from it as well
3633516 earlier in the year when we were both sitting in the stands and watching kurt and jon griffin go at it that makes you more determined to train harder
3633517 when you get the opportunity it makes you value your position in the side a lot more so since weve come in weve made sure the opportunity hasnt slipped
3633518 the good thing about this year is weve bonded really well especially the young guys coming through and the mateship between us is really strong and you can see it in the way were playing
3633519 hopefully we can keep that and make that really strong for the future it really helps i believe
3633520 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3633521 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3633522 looking to fiscal 2009 conditions remain challenging but we expect earnings growth for the sixth consecutive year
3633523 the outcome was very pleasing in the light of financial market turmoil that resulted in slowing initial public offerings and merger and acquisition activity and substantial falls in northern hemisphere interest rates

3633529 the reason why little peiyi was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image the reason was for the national interest

3633531 i dont think we want to get drawn into a row with the chinese

3633536 in august 1924 the small nation of georgia occupied by soviet russia since 1921 rose up against soviet rule on sept 16 1924
3633537 unlikely was an understatement georgians did not enjoy freedom again until 1991
3633538 the free and independent social democratic state of georgia will always remain in my memory as a classic example of an imperialist small nation both in territory snatching outside and bureaucratic tyranny inside its chauvinism was beyond all bounds
3633539 in the hope of avoiding a proliferation of an unpredictable number of small states the international community in its collective wisdom decreed that it would recognize only the ussrs constituent union republics and would thus not give any encouragement to the yearning for self determination that characterized some ethnic minorities living in regions endowed with only lower level autonomy according to the soviet administrative system such as the autonomous republic of abkhazia and the autonomous region of south ossetia both lower status entities within the union republic of soviet georgia it was a huge irony that in adopting this stance the west was effectively enshrining the divisions created for his fiefdom by none other than the soviet dictator iosep besarionis dze dzhughashvili a georgian known to the wider world as joseph vissarionovich stalin
3633540 had the soviet union collapsed during the first decade of its existence in the 1920s before abkhazia was reduced in status by fiat of stalin in february 1931 from being a fully fledged republic which entered the transcaucasian federation on 13 december 1922 in treaty alliance with georgia to that of an autonomous republic within georgia and had the then league of nations adopted the same principle of recognition later practiced by its successor the united nations then abkhazia would for decades have enjoyed independence and membership in its own right of the said international community
3633541 the aggressive politics of the government of georgia towards abkhazia occasioned extreme displeasure among the local abkhazian armenian russian greek and a significant proportion of the kartvelian peoples which actually helped to facilitate the establishment of soviet power in the region on march 4th 1921
3633542 as a deliverance from the repression and meddling of the georgian republic
3633543 the politics of this state was quite accurately characterized by one of its eminent activists the jurist internationalist zurab avalov avalishvili in his book the independence of georgia in international politics 1918 1921 paris 1924 he remarked at the start of 1921 georgia had in the person of its government and in the shape of the constituent assembly a simple creature of party organization georgian democracy 1917 1921 a form of social democratic dictatorship i e of the right wing of marxism was a period of preparation for the triumph in georgia of soviet dictatorship
3633544 when i was growing up i found that the main argument against laissez faire and for socialism was that socialism and communism were inevitable you cant turn back the clock
3633545 social democracy is still here in all its variants defining our entire respectable political spectrum from advanced victimology and feminism on the left over to neoconservatism on the right we are now trapped in america inside a menshevik fantasy with the narrow bounds of respectable debate set for us by various brands of marxists it is now our task the task of the resurgent right of the paleo movement to break those bonds to finish the job to finish off marxism forever
3633546 it as a child would bloodlessly and even quite playfully retake a shiny red ball from a playmate those evil russkies on the other hand
3633547 now now my sweet i cant allow others to hear your pleasure
3633548 i remember my brother helping him over there when he could barely get up the stairs
3633549 he didnt want to just volunteer in the office and do something
3633550 he wanted to be a sort of continuing presence in the outside world for people who couldnt get out anymore
3633551 he always was willing to take on the most difficult patients people who didnt always live in very nice conditions no air conditioning and he would show up faithfully
3633552 he was catholic and he lived the values of his faith on a daily basis he embodied his faith

3633563 to be very careful and sensitive these days the russians are selling many arms to iran and syria and there is no need to offer them an excuse to sell even more advanced weapons
3633564 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3633565 we did see that there was potential for a conflagration in the region but georgia is a friendly state its supported by the u s and so it was difficult to refuse
3633566 i was just informed were updating our account center to re calibrate our rating system
3633567 she got a lot of satisfaction out of saving a lot of real people real dollars
3633568 she would do two or three or four outreaches in a day and go from the northern suburbs then into the city then to the southern suburbs the whole point was to bring the property tax appeal system to the taxpayers
3633569 she also sponsored legislation and reform that basically brought to cook county the illinois property tax appeal board it is a state agency and prior to that every county except cook county could appeal their property taxes to this board
3633570 and she wasnt just a political figurehead in the first two or three weeks i think she found 34 candidates to fill open seats and in places there hadnt been a republican candidate for years
3633571 but through the fundraisers and putting in some of her own money she ran a legitimate office but also erased the debt when she left it was in the black
3633572 after i was born she was this stay at home mom and she didnt even drive
3633573 she spent so much time with politics but she never shortchanged us either i dont know how she pulled it off anybody would be befuddled how she would go to orland park to elgin to do these outreach seminars and then never miss a family event
3633574 that was a tough time for her if you talked to her last week about it it would tear her heart out
3633575 the tendency toward cult and coterie by which literary magazines usually define their particular territory and assert their standards

3633625 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
3633626 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
3633627 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
3633628 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
3633629 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
3633630 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3633631 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3633632 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3633633 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3633634 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3633635 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3633636 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3633637 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3633638 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3633639 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3633640 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3633641 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3633642 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3633655 the first is not to resort to the use of force the second is to halt all military action the third is free access to humanitarian aid the fourth is that georgian armed forces should return to their bases the fifth is that russian armed forces should pull back to their positions prior to combat

3633679 the case needs to be probed because if it becomes a practice then nobody would come forward to adopt a child in india and rich people from abroad will continue coming to the country and indulge in surrogacy it is misuse of law

3633683 screening for depression during pregnancy is important for this population group given latinas
3633684 the sample for this study was a low income population our conclusions may or may not be different for women in other socioeconomic status ses groups hence more research needs to be conducted among latinas from differing ses groups including research focusing on the role of social support and cultural values beliefs related to childbirth and pregnancy among latinas
3633685 the higher prevalence rate of depression in americanized latina women is of concern in our community as the population demographics clearly indicate a significant rate of growth of this group in their childbearing years
3633686 thus it is important to more clearly understand the circumstances that affect their physical and emotional well being during pregnancy so that preventive measures can be initiated this is critical for the overall health of both the mother and child

3633721 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3633722 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3633723 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3633724 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3633725 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3633726 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3633727 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3633728 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3633734 its a state which has seen such strong economic growth in recent years and all that comes at a price people have to have places to live suburbs in which to build their homes

3633737 maybe during the convention the republicans can dedicate a large screen monitor at the xcel center to keep track of obamas second european jaunt of the campaign they could call it where in the world is barack obama the show could track him through the summer houses of the rich and famous americans who can afford to own villas overseas and put dollar signs up on a map wherever he stops off for some foie gras

3633753 when i use a word humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone it means just what i choose it to mean neither more nor less

3633761 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
3633762 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
3633763 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
3633764 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
3633765 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3633766 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3633767 i have so many things to worry about and the state budget was one more thing
3633768 for right now were going to do what we have to do to comply with the executive order these tests are important and theyre needed if we continue to not have a budget this is going to become a severe challenge for my agency
3633769 ive been waiting for 3 1 2 years actually more

3633773 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together

3633775 in a seven hour span friday detroit mayor kwame kilpatrick endured a surreal journey that found him pleading to get out of jail in the morning facing a pair of new felony charges shortly afterward standing glumly for an eerie video arraignment in the afternoon and finally arriving back at city hall wearing jeans a dress shirt and electronic tether
3633776 the mayor is simply less intimidating today with a tether around his ankle than he was in 2002 or 2003 when he was firing cops who disagreed with him
3633777 others were more explicit about how they thought the distraction should be brought to an end several area leaders made or renewed calls for kilpatrick to either resign or be removed from office some did so quietly while others made public statements
3633778 its going to be broadcast all around the world and its one more blow that the city of detroit should not have to take and for that matter it involves in a negative way the image of the entire region
3633779 if youre doing business in the city of detroit if you own assets in the city of detroit if your corporate headquarters or other buildings that you own and operate out of are operating in the city of detroit you have a voice you have a stake in what happens in this city and you ought to be using that voice to express your concerns about your stake in this city
3633780 you declare the way you are voting when you walk into a voting booth
3633781 it would be very hard to prove that there was concerted effort to get democrats to vote in a republican primary or vice versa even if you could prove that i dont see its illegal
3633782 im going to protect the voting rights of republican primary voters this is about protecting the integrity of the ballot
3633783 whos to say who you voted for in the gop primary
3633784 you could have voted for david davis or third place gop primary finisher michael sabri whos to say you actually voted for roe people dont vote straight party lines anymore
3633785 we are working very hard in the 1st congressional district to elect democrats thats where our focus has been we did nothing to organize any democrats to vote in the 1st congressional district for either davis or roe
3633786 we have some debt that will be paid out of that
3633787 roe ran a grass roots campaign that challenged the status quo and put people before politics there is no doubt that he will be the next representative for tennessees 1st district
3633788 i predict it will be certified by the state republican party and that will be the end of it i trust the system
3633789 going after your opponent for being of the world seemed a bit jarring a bit odd
3633790 their campaign really seems pretty out of touch with what the american people want to see and hear during the olympics
3633791 theyre using a gigantic stage to make their national case against obama
3633792 it doesnt seem to be causing any uproar they may have guessed right
3633793 focused on ensuring that voters have the best information possible to make an informed decision on election day
3633794 i will take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3633795 unlike barack obama harley owners appreciate open roads and open markets
3633796 do you think guys are stupid why are they stupid
3633797 hey i wanna spend some time with you how about a movie or something
3633798 can i just tell you that that was totally random
3633799 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3633800 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3633801 ew are you trying to hold my hand are you gay or something omg you guys jennys gay
3633802 you have always been unique you have never had to try to be different
3633803 i love you dearly and i hope we meet again
3633804 i think id like to fuck you really hard it would be amazing
3633805 i read your posts all the time but i never talk to you
3633806 i have this fantasy where you suck my toes all night and then theres the one with you and the spoons
3633807 supposedly his opponents blood work came back and didnt meet requirements so he had to reschedule a new test we never heard back from him two days before the show our contact through him was mark long who is usually reliable but they definitely screwed us out of a great main event
3633808 we didnt even get a phone call the athletic commission doesnt allow last minute replacements either so we were kind of in a situation where we just had to cancel the deal
3633809 it was awesome had about 1 000 people show up throughout the day
3633810 we had some good demonstrations nate mohr and i grappled for the audience for about 30 minutes then recent ultimate fighter winner amir sadollah and i went at it it was great
3633811 that division is stacked i love the level of competition and quite honestly although i competed most of my career at lightweight and featherweight i feel its a better fit for my style
3633812 i am a very technical paced fighter i am a different style fighter than urijah faber whose style i feel is a great match for even bigger guys
3633813 i wont have any problem with the weight cut at all my diet and nutrition line will help me stay on track thats what i designed it for
3633814 i see it being more technical if anything because i feel guys that small we have always had to deal with size issues always have to deal with being the smaller guy on the mat it teaches you to be more technical and learn to survive not to mention the speed factor as well
3633815 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3633816 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3633817 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3633818 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3633819 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3633820 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3633821 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3633822 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3633823 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3633824 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3633825 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3633826 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3633827 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3633828 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3633829 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3633830 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3633831 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3633832 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps
3633833 no one in the democratic party would want to be publicly associated with him
3633834 he was raised as one of us the son of a mill worker he always said
3633835 fighting poverty and providing health care for everybody i hope those are still always his beliefs
3633836 had that not happened i think he would have made an absolutely incredible secretary of labor
3633837 we would have loved to see him play a prominent role in government
3633838 he was the first person since lyndon johnson to address it in a meaningful way
3633839 he was very sincere about wanting to cure the problems
3633840 hes going to have to rebuild his base from the bottom
3633841 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway i mean im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3633842 please help us shrink the supply of oil and block refinery and nuclear plant construction so that the price of gasoline and power will be so expensive well have to live like our great grandparents without cars modern electric powered appliances airplanes and without the things made in factories and raised on modern farms
3633843 im trying to save the planet im trying to save the planet
3633844 this is an enormous waste of law enforcement resources that should be focused on violent and serious crime
3633845 an addictive drug which induces in its users insanity criminality and death
3633846 the perception that marijuana is about fun and freedom it isnt its about dependency disease and dysfunction
3633847 not soon but eventually youll see the development of a marijuana futures market
3633848 theres been a lot of rumours flying around but i am not going anywhere there is a job to do here and i am looking forward to it there is speculation around the club and that has been prevalent since i joined the club from my own point of view i am very focused on what i am about and what i aim to achieve here and that means success on the pitch nothing whatsoever has changed in that respect and the football operation hasnt changed since i signed for the club nor has my relationship with garry cook and his team we get on really well and continue to speak on a daily basis i am the guy that makes the decisions in relation to the football and they make the decisions in relation to the running of the club
3633849 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from united when they were at the very top of their game i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic with the injuries weve had as players we can all raise the bar a little bit with it being that close in the premier league and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money i think we can close the gap because man utd were at the very top of their game last season im taking nothing away from them because theyve been unbelievable over the past two years but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3633850 thaksin shinawatra has pulled the plug on manchester citys big spending days and they will now have to cut their cloth accordingly
3633851 mike ashley has revealed that newcastle united still owe 27m in outstanding payments on transfer deals completed before the billionaire owner of sports direct bought the club last summer
3633852 if redknapp can find someone other than niko kranjcar to provide them with adequate service and you wouldnt bet against him portsmouth are muscular obstinate and experienced enough to compete for the premier leagues best of the rest tag
3633853 even if all the chips fall where newcastle want them to the best they will finish is fifth ultimately thats not really what they want or what they need
3633854 the sunday we went up i turned the phone off i turned it on late monday afternoon and i had 87 messages quite a big percentage were from agents i had never spoken to before in my life i had all these new friends
3633855 dimitar berbatov is expected to agree personal terms and seal his 25million move to manchester united sportsmail understands that the bulgaria striker is due at uniteds carrington training centre after finally being given permission by tottenham hotspur to talk to the barclays premier league and european champions the 27 year old will be offered a four year deal worth in the region of 80 000 a week united hope he will appear on their official pre season team photo scheduled to be taken on friday
3633856 thaksin shinawatra has pulled the plug on manchester citys big spending days and they will now have to cut their cloth accordingly the clubs executive chairman garry cook admitted legal problems in his native country will mean the thai billionaire will no longer be able to bankroll citys bid to break into the top four of the premier league shinawatra sanctioned over 60m worth of signings in his first year after buying the club but new boss mark hughes cannot rely on the open cheque book he thought he would be given after arriving from blackburn
3633857 mark hughes has presented manchester city with a test of their financial clout by demanding the acquisition of a new striker before the close of the transfer window city attempted to ease growing fears over their financial future yesterday when their executive chairman garry cook insisted the clubs finances had not been jeopardised by thaksin shinawatras decision to flee a corruption hearing in thailand and seek exile in britain leaving behind 800m in frozen assets but the insistence it is business as usual and that hughes does not have to sell before he can add to his squad will be tested by the managers transfer requirements
3633858 executive director garry cook brought in by thaksin this summer as part of an overhaul of senior management and a leading figure in citys very public pursuit of ronaldinho has insisted that the clubs future was not threatened by the former thai prime ministers decision not to return to his homeland where he faces fraud and corruption charges and where some 800 million of the businessmans assets are frozen
3633859 mike ashley has revealed that newcastle united still owe 27m in outstanding payments on transfer deals completed before the billionaire owner of sports direct bought the club last summer
3633860 financially newcastle united was in a difficult positon because i really do think that it had over extended itself
3633861 we first heard about the potential sale on a saturday and had the deal done by the wednesday so if you are asking if we did due diligence before buying then the answer has to be no
3633862 aston villa are preparing a fresh 6million bid for newcastle winger james milner the england under 21 international remains a part of kevin keegans plans for the season but the newcastle manager may be prepared to cash in as martin oneill continues his pursuit of a player who spent a year on loan at villa park
3633863 crisis hit arsenal boss arsene wenger is without nine gunners stars for crunch champions league qualifying showdown against fc twente and cesc fabregas will miss the first two weeks of the season with a hamstring injury wenger must now take one of the biggest gambles of his career as he relies on his kids to take care of steve mcclarens side summer signing aaron ramsay 17 will make his debut in fabs absence after arsenal jetted over to holland last night with six teenagers in their 18 man squad
3633864 the remaining senior players robin van persie emmanuel adebayor and william gallas to soak up in a match that arsenal cannot afford to lose not when failure to qualify for the lucrative stages of the champions league would ensure that another big name would follow alexander hleb out of the door before august 31 and certainly not when the opposition manager is mcclaren lousy when he was the england head coach he begins a new life with fc twente this evening he was forced to sell two of his best players orlando engelaar and karim el ahmadi in the summer to finance rebuilding work at the clubs modest stadium and he runs headlong into one of european footballs heavyweights good luck
3633865 when aaron ramsey signed for arsenal in a 5m deal from cardiff city this summer he envisaged that one day he would play a part for the club in vital champions league ties arsenal are a club that always gives young players the opportunity at the highest level he said when asked what had made him favour the emirates over other potential destinations in his most outlandish fantasies however the 17 year old could not have pictured himself making his competitive debut for the club in a european fixture that ars ne wenger described yesterday as the biggest game of the season
3633866 even with a makeshift midfield few are expecting arsenal to have it too hard this evening and mcclaren is certainly not relying on this 90 minutes to restore his reputation he has not shed his old skin completely though the key word he said is belief a lot of times underdogs underperform because they do not believe they can do it id like a good performance to be in the second leg and still have a chance the best team doesnt always win i know that more than anyone and he flashes that smile you know the one
3633867 in a belgian city famous for its gunsmiths rafael benitez will learn a little more tonight about whether the two strikers he has brought together can fire liverpool to the place where every elite european side wants to be romes stadio olimpico eight and half months from now
3633868 todays column was intended to be a little more uplifting more on the theme of a season of surprises liverpool for the title was the tag and it went west the moment the owners tom hicks and george gillett jr decided that they knew more about a footballers worth to his club than their manager rafael ben tez it is hard to fancy liverpool to overturn manchester united and chelsea now yet when the summer began gareth barry was set to be ben tezs missing link and had the club bought him this could have been their season to evolve from a team capable of impressing in set piece matches in europe to one capable of emerging triumphant from the slog of the domestic season
3633869 further his aim to make the london club the biggest sporting brand in the country
3633870 we are told constantly that the premier league is huge in china that this is the most important market for their weekly menu of strop and hissy fit yet one of the most striking things about dipping into chinese sporting culture is how little interest there is in our football here even as the premier league readies itself for a new season basketball rules
3633871 scolari made it clear when he was coach of portugal during euro 2008 that he has a special feeling for knockout games he loves building the players up to an emotional peak clearly this will come in handy in the champions league but what about the premier league a league competition with games every week where three points in august are worth the same as three points in may these are uncharted waters for scolari
3633872 it is something i dont need but nothing surprises me in football anymore though the bookies have made their predictions and we will have to see what happens it doesnt concern me only if it comes true but i am confident i have got the backing of the club and the board
3633873 as we sit in his office overlooking the britannia stadium pitch at stoke city there is evidence all around of the jump he and the club are about to make
3633874 if redknapp can find someone other than niko kranjcar to provide them with adequate service and you wouldnt bet against him portsmouth are muscular obstinate and experienced enough to compete for the premier leagues best of the rest tag
3633875 even if all the chips fall where newcastle want them to the best they will finish is fifth ultimately thats not really what they want or what they need
3633876 the gunners look a little short of quality to me and i think they might slip from third to fourth this season there have been a couple of high profile departures from the club in alexander hleb and mathieu flamini new signing samir nasri looks like a scaled down version of hleb and im a bit worried about emmanuel adebayor who i think did want to leave over the summer we dont know for sure when eduardo will be back and although i like the look of youngster jack wilshire i think this year might be a little too early for him it must be a big season for theo walcott
3633877 an eight goal thriller two refereeing cock ups late goals and a shock result that no one saw coming ligue 1 got off to a cracking start at the weekend even if the name of the team at the top of the table has a familiar ring to it
3633878 it has been 14 years since the last competitive instalment but tomorrow night the greatest rivalry in soviet football will be reawakened as spartak moscow host dynamo kyiv in the first leg of the champions league third qualifying round match both claim to have been outsiders heroically battling the soviet regime the plucky ukrainians on one side and the catering union on the other unaffiliated to any of the great organs of state and both drew on such mythologies to foster the drive that made them the most successful sides in soviet history spartak won 12 league titles dynamo 13 their meetings were habitually bitter and eventful none more so than the first of their two encounters in the champions league in 1994
3633879 believe it or not it was actually better toward the end landon donovan said of his relationship with gullit
3633880 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
3633881 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3633882 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line
3633883 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months

3633886 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well

3633896 i have not had a cigarette in over 72 hours and i turned one down today
3633897 who gave you the right the permission the clearance the verification and insinuation that you are free who did this who taught you to read it was against the law and you are too obtuse to understand the meaning of these words yet you insist on speaking them yet you insist on looking me in the eye and demanding that i address you by your name who do you think you are and who let you in here i said who let you in here where the sign said niggers and women need not apply

3633913 in countless public fora the bush administration has pledged its committment to georgias territorial integrity that committment has always been followed by the hope that all potential conflicts would be resolved peacefully administration officials insist that in private conversations at the highest levels they have told the georgians that their committment did not include military intervention on georgias behalf and say they have repeatedly urged the georgians not to provoke the russian bear but this stance gives rise to a question at natos most recent summit the administration pushed very hard to grant georgia a place on the initial rung of the ladder toward nato membership european governments blocked that attempt but u s remains committed to getting georgia into the atlantic alliance the definition of nato membership of course is a mutual defense committment an attack on one equals an attack on all are we ready to go into battle against russia to defend georgia in nato
3633914 this question has gotten pretty heavy coverage over the past week
3633915 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3633916 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3633917 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3633918 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3633919 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3633920 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3633921 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3633922 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3633923 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3633924 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3633925 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3633926 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3633927 isnt it a happy occasion to be in company of like minded friends from afar
3633928 im just guessing but someone must have said to her you better get your act together or else
3633929 if someone is trying to sell photos of britney in cabo theyre doing so without her knowledge or permission
3633930 to elsie i think that we do not have a real good choice with either candidate but i fail to see how you think obama will help with our moral decline as he apparently is a strong supporter of abortion and gay rights
3633931 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3633932 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3633933 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3633934 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3633935 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3633936 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3633937 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3633938 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3633939 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3633940 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3633941 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3633942 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3633943 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3633944 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3633945 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3633946 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3633947 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3633948 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3633949 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3633950 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3633951 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3633952 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3633953 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3633954 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3633955 thats kind of the difference between top notch pitchers and the average ones
3633956 when they get in a jam they can actually get out of it themselves
3633957 you just want to perform your best for everybody out there gonzalez said
3633958 not only the fans here but also for my friends and family back home in miami
3633959 when jerry blevins got me out of that inning we knew we were going to win this game
3633960 well her skirt is much too short and we feel that her morality is in question
3633961 las ballenas jorobadas y las ballenas francas australes eubalaena australis est n volviendo a buena parte de su rea de repartici n principalmente porque
3633962 se ala en un comunicado el presidente del grupo de especialistas de cet ceos de la uicn randall reeves
3633963 una gran cantidad de peque os cet ceos costeros como el delf n de irrawaddy orcaella brevirostris la marsopa negra phocoena spinipinnis y el delf n de plata pontoporia blainvillei son v ctimas de capturas accidentales durante la pesca considerada la peor amenaza para estas especies
3633964 las zonas de h bitats de importancia cr tica deben ser cerradas a determinados tipos de pesca por lo menos de forma estacional para garantizar la supervivencia de algunas especies
3633965 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3633966 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3633967 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3633968 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3633969 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3633970 its just not responsible to be saying things like that
3633971 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3633972 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3633973 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3633974 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3633975 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3633976 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3633977 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3633978 quiero daros las gracias por haber le do la larga historia de dragonball con tanto cari o
3633979 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3633980 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3633981 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3633982 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3633983 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3633984 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3633985 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3633986 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3633987 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3633988 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3633989 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3633990 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3633991 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3633992 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3633993 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3633994 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3633995 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3633996 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3633997 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3633998 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3633999 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3634000 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3634001 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3634002 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3634003 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3634004 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3634005 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3634006 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3634007 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3634008 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3634009 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
3634010 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
3634011 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3634012 fake singing for national honor what kind of lessons are we giving such a small child
3634013 most viewers thought these were live shots so our work achieved its effect
3634014 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by zhang yimou here this is actually almost animation a footstep a second 29 in all to signify the 29 olympiads
3634015 we said earlier that aspects of this opening ceremony are almost like cinema in real time well this is quite literally cinematic
3634016 but we have a provisional cessation of hostilities and everyone should be aware that this is considerable progress there is still much work to be done
3634017 we know that if other peoples freedom is threatened then its not long before our freedom is threatened
3634018 we are here to say that we are not afraid
3634019 traditionally we will see a few skirmishes but frontal attacks and positioning will end
3634020 are you kidding me its a black dude well not necessarily a dude but someone from kenya
3634021 i dunno whatever the hell they have in kenya lions or giraffes or whatever
3634022 i dont know what you want from me just make the powerpoint sexier
3634023 im here late tonight if you want to finish it up
3634024 y en sus lienzos los temas son variados aunque toca con frecuencia
3634025 fresh credit worries and the subsequent share falls on wall street are weighing on sentiment
3634026 despite oils falls investors remain cautious as concerns about fundamentals such as economies and corporate earnings pervade the markets
3634027 we remain wary of any rebound in oil and commodity prices as it could trigger a partial reversal of recent moves
3634028 although markets have moved quickly we expect further consolidation of new ranges up ahead and shift our euro dollar forecasts to 1 51 and 1 47 for 1 month and 3 months respectively
3634029 limiting sonar use in breeding grounds and other key habitat areas is essential for the conservation of whales dolphins and other marine mammals
3634030 this agreement protects both national security and our most treasured natural resources
3634031 we get some areas to train and they get some areas that are off limits
3634032 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry
3634033 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
3634034 russia now flush with cash wants to rebuild its 19th century imperial sphere of influence in the former soviet union
3634035 it also wants to make an example out of georgia to other nato aspirants what the chinese call kill the chicken to take care of the monkey so the ukrainians will think russia would use force to prevent them from joining nato
3634036 captain cant you see the ship is gonna blow do something i beseech
3634037 tori thought she deserved parity and shes got a point
3634038 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spin off
3634039 in some way every show that followed 90210 was a remake of 90210 for the fans sake i am really happy for them
3634040 velvet revolvers new album will draw heavily on their messy split with scott the band wanted a big name who could easily hold his own and reckon lenny is just the man for the job
3634041 i definitely want to do a duet its just about finding the right thing and the right time
3634042 i miss singing so i am planning to do some more next year i did a duet with kylie on her tour last year we sang
3634043 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him he sent her a personal message asking her to get on board
3634044 he has always admired her music and thinks she is the perfect choice because of her unique appeal to black and white voters
3634045 she believes he is going to be the first black american president and she is honoured to be part of that
3634046 i want to prove they have made a big mistake i dont think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here
3634047 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds i am waiting
3634048 its really disappointing of course it is but at the time amy was going through some s t and now shes doing great so who cares if we missed the bond boat
3634049 mccain was friend to both democrats and republicans penning bills co sponsored by left and right and me
3634050 though mccain toiled 26 years in congressional harness fighting greed spending corruption and taxes seeking balanced budgets and finance reform while his juniors sampled collegiate drugs freshman obama says such toils are ambiguous
3634051 while pilot mccain learned what deploying u s policy really means obama suckled kindergarten milk and cookies in hawaii mccain lived tactics and strategy and leadership and military budgets while obama read legal theory but obama says mccains life is ambiguous and obama is an honorable man
3634052 mccain attended 20 public schools in 20 american towns following his navy fathers footsteps
3634053 i speak not to disprove obama but to say what i know
3634054 now is the winter of our discontent made glorious by this son of change his church he owns then quits guns he outlaws then approves abortion he approves then despairs rich donors he disdains then retains raised by whites he claims black culture with flags he abhorred hes now adorned now not iran meetings he craved but now says theyre depraved at private schools he reigned yet tis humility he claims no strings debates he proposed now hes not disposed he spouts wisdom to fix the world yet chicago he fixed not he plants hope for new change but reaps old school socialism but obama says mccain is ambiguous and obama is a changeable man
3634055 hej arvid h r finns det bilar att leka med
3634056 hej l h r finns det dockor att leka med
3634057 dina titus and i have served together in the nevada legislature and im looking forward to a spirited campaign
3634058 we ran a six month campaign in two and a half weeks
3634059 bruce woodbury has been a visionary leader i have to follow in his footsteps
3634060 i was running against an incumbent and tomorrow morning ill be back on the trail again
3634061 this has been a pretty hard year for republicans but were going to work harder and smarter
3634062 brian scroggins is very worthy of the position we came to support him and join the rest of our republican friends and of course to support jon porter
3634063 no one knows who the judges are which is a sad thing we are originally from california and when election time comes all candidates send out information on themselves i guess they dont do that here or they just dont care
3634064 its time for a change new blood and new ideas
3634065 ive always been a supporter of the republican party but i havent always been able to do as much as i like
3634066 i feel that voters are scared and are opting out of voting especially young voters im very concerned about the direction we are going in
3634067 theres no program were just going to watch the poll results have a good time have some libations and great barbeque food
3634068 we wanted to celebrate our candidates and the people who are working for them
3634069 from here on out its really going to be all out
3634070 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3634071 im convinced that the national interest demands a new approach to our interaction with the world
3634072 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3634073 is vulnerable to adversaries who seek information about our nations homeland defense programs classified or unclassified
3634074 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
3634075 we assess that intent to attack the u s homeland remains undiminished
3634076 now has many of the operational and organizational advantages it once enjoyed across the border in afghanistan
3634077 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3634078 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3634079 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3634080 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3634081 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3634082 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3634083 jed did a nice job in the limited plays that he had offensively but also on special teams
3634084 that fullback position youve got to produce on special teams or youre going to struggle to make it there collins did the best job of the other guys on the special teams unit
3634085 there are 11 starters on offense and 11 starters on defense if you aint one of them you better be good at special teams
3634086 special teams keeps you around and that gives you a chance to make plays in other ways
3634087 you can get in the rotation and get a chance to make plays on offense or defense because of what you do on special teams because if you dont make it on special teams you definitely wont get a chance to make it on offense or defense
3634088 weve got guys that have got to be major contributors on special teams
3634089 that is a major area of emphasis for us just making sure that we have the guys out there that can provide us the best chance of success
3634090 if you arent a starter you really have to make a living as a special teams player
3634091 there are a lot of good position players out there who cant play special teams who dont end up making it
3634092 special teams is an important part of the game its a third of it and a lot of valuable field position can be determined by it an older guy like myself i try to preach it to the younger guys
3634093 dealing with gay tourism has to be done in an intelligent and sensitive way
3634094 it is wanted its just tricky like so many things in israel
3634095 ive been trying to withdraw my salary since yesterday morning i dont have a shekel in my pocket
3634096 the new government is in charge of all the palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip
3634097 all those who are on the payroll of the palestinian authority will soon receive full salaries
3634098 were not going to give money to the hamas government there but we cant ignore the people
3634099 at this point any conflict i might have is more than eased by the knowledge that barack obama if elected could be the salvation of a country in free flight failure
3634100 faces at the bottom of the well the permanence of racism
3634101 if he sounded as i might wish him to sound he could not be elected
3634102 and he may not be elected even as his intellect and savvy put him worlds ahead of his republican counterpart and that is all i wish to say on the matter
3634103 im not arguing that its wrong to vote for obama though i do say its wrongheaded to vote for him with any lofty expectations
3634104 i feel this sometimes has something to do with something i care about and as things go in u s politics its not the worst thing to happen
3634105 how race survived u s history from settlement and slavery to the obama phenomenon
3634106 obama does not represent the triumph of an advancing anti racist movement but rather the necessity at the highly refracted level of electoral politics of abandoning old agendas largely by not mentioning them
3634107 its an odd paradox that this will shrink even further any kind of public space to talk about race
3634108 theyre voting for the end of affirmative action and they dont even know it
3634109 theyre voting for the end of race and they dont even know it
3634110 everybody is so enticed and intrigued all at once just by the mere fact that hes black as if thats enough
3634111 from that to seeing barack obama and the enthusiasm hes generated its almost full circle to me that america could grow to the point where it could see someone like barack obama in a different light
3634112 his candidacy hinged on putting a happy face on racism and here he reveals to his credit knowledge and compassion about racism and its tentacles into the present he was running away from history and this has forced him to talk about the past which blows away his transcendental cover
3634113 you remarked that reverend jeremiah wright expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country a view that sees white racism as endemic
3634114 we believe that wright is exactly right that racism is not only endemic but is at the core of american society as reflected in a large and well established body of social scientific research
3634115 it was the best speech on race ever given by a major presidential candidate
3634116 i think it really is going to change the way responsible people talk about racism
3634117 their basic idea that racism is at the heart of how americans feel simply has been shown not to be true in the way that they said it
3634118 are they still going to whine endlessly about racism in america
3634119 there is going to be a furious effort to use evidence to show that racism is still this deep scar in the american experience
3634120 theres a big chunk of white america that wishes blacks well and doesnt feel contempt or dislike for them people talk about a backlash but it never enters their head that their might be a frontlash
3634121 i think it will be hugely positive if obama wins because there will be this possibility of a more genuine conversation between scholars of different orientations
3634122 i think it will mess up the congestion in a way that will be very healthy i cant wait for that part of it
3634123 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3634124 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3634125 she was a very intelligent dog to live for that long
3634126 she was jumping on me and excited to get out of there
3634127 he went running toward her trying to feed her treats
3634128 this court is of the opinion that the forest service violated the public interest when it flagrantly and cavalierly railroaded this countrys present environmental laws in an attempt to build an outgoing presidents enduring fame
3634129 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3634130 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3634131 the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability
3634132 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3634133 hey takao i actually started jogging lately and am going to run a marathon this winter

3634145 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3634146 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3634147 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3634148 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3634149 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3634150 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3634151 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3634152 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3634153 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3634154 just so you all know we did set a record
3634155 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3634156 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3634157 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3634158 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3634159 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3634160 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3634161 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3634162 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3634163 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3634164 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3634165 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him

3634167 lord youve created us and youve given us instruction but weve failed you you tell us to have faith but faith can no longer exist in a world so full of reason and insanity i ask you now with all of my heart show the people of this pitiful planet that we cannot take life the gift you have given us for granted any longer extend your divine hand and perform a miracle for the world to see a miracle that no man woman or child on the face of this earth can deny in jesus christs name i pray amen

3634196 the size of the warming is broadly consistent with predictions of climate models
3634197 the fact that the global mean temperature has increased since the late 19th century and that other trends have been observed does not necessarily mean that an anthropogenic effect on the climate has been identified climate has always varied on all time scales so the observed change may be natural

3634206 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3634207 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3634208 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
3634209 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3634210 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3634211 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3634212 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3634213 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3634214 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3634215 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3634216 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3634217 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3634218 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3634219 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3634220 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3634221 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3634222 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3634223 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3634224 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3634225 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3634226 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3634227 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3634228 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3634229 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3634230 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3634231 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3634232 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3634233 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3634234 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3634235 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3634236 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3634237 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3634238 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3634239 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3634240 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3634241 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3634242 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3634243 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3634244 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3634245 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3634246 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3634247 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3634248 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3634249 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3634250 if saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by iraqs weapons of mass destruction program
3634251 we must stop saddam from ever again jeopardizing the stability and the security of his neighbors with weapons of mass destruction
3634252 saddam will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has ten times since 1983
3634253 the problem is not nuclear testing it is nuclear weapons the number of third world countries with nuclear capabilities seems to grow daily saddam husseins near success with developing a nuclear weapon should be an eye opener for us all
3634254 one of the most compelling threats we in this country face today is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction threat assessments regularly warn us of the possibility that iraq may acquire or develop nuclear weapons
3634255 if you dont believe saddam hussein is a threat with nuclear weapons then you shouldnt vote for me
3634256 serving on the intelligence committee and seeing day after day week after week briefings on saddams weapons of mass destruction and his plans on using those weapons he cannot be allowed to have nuclear weapons its just that simple the whole world changes if saddam ever has nuclear weapons
3634257 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
3634258 we urge you after consulting with congress and consistent with the u s constitution and laws to take necessary actions including if appropriate air and missile strikes on suspect iraqi sites to respond effectively to the threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs
3634259 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
3634260 i will be voting to give the president of the u s the authority to use force if necessary to disarm saddam because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security without question we need to disarm saddam hussein
3634261 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
3634262 we begin with a common belief that saddam hussein is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them
3634263 we know that he has stored nuclear supplies secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
3634264 we are in possession of what i think to be compelling evidence that saddam hussein has and has had for a number of years a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction
3634265 real results by the end of my first term in office
3634266 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
3634267 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
3634268 i think its one of the best one of the fastest around
3634269 our defensive ends are unbelievable the line is coming into their own and our dbs are great
3634270 its not like we were going up against a bunch of slouches
3634271 people talk about how inexperienced they are but what they fail to realize is a lot of those guys played a lot of snaps for us mike wright nai fotu and stevenson sylvester all played a lot its not like they havent been in a division i college football game before
3634272 if both are working its an 04 year that is the bottom line if they are both working together
3634273 were going to come back even stronger in the team finals
3634274 the doctors in vegas told me that i wouldnt be able to walk for four to six months and i thought to myself you just played in your last game
3634275 he really hasnt missed a beat and the amazing thing is he is moving around better and running better than a year ago because hes lighter
3634276 you see the movies of the guy pushing his wife in a wheelchair and her holding the baby i wanted that to be me
3634277 so that was my motivation to be walking before then
3634278 when the doctors told us that in the las vegas hospital she was worried she would have to be taking care of two babies
3634279 its been one of the great stories of the offseason
3634280 hes back and he might be better than hes ever been
3634281 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3634282 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3634283 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3634284 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3634285 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3634286 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3634287 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3634288 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3634289 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3634290 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3634291 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3634292 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3634293 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3634294 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3634295 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3634296 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3634297 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat

3634301 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
3634302 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3634303 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
3634304 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
3634305 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border

3634307 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3634308 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3634309 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3634310 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3634311 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3634312 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3634313 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3634314 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3634315 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3634316 its my birthday and im taking a bath in the sink at burger king

3634320 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3634321 id love to give him a full sibling but i just couldnt do it its so unfortunate
3634322 in addition to being tall and well educated their motivations for donation are quite sincere they want to help childless couples they tended to sell out very fast
3634323 you can never say never but it seems like a very remote possibility
3634324 there are a lot of people in the field who would question the utility of the regulation as it now stands
3634325 if these kinds of operations continue against us in the tribal areas we will continue this
3634326 il tempo una linea diritta in divenire tanto vale uardare in avanti
3634327 it looks like its going slow but theres a lot of torque generated which can make the gears go faster

3634329 when he was growing up i was cleaning up his room and i remember finding this thing that looked like a bomb
3634330 i dont know how he learned but he knows how
3634331 he knows how to build everything hes always on the computer reading about how things work
3634332 he first got interested in physics and then when we went to louisiana he got interested in meteorology
3634333 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3634334 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3634335 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3634336 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3634337 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3634338 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3634339 in the next 10 years we will put a man on the moon
3634340 if saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by iraqs weapons of mass destruction program
3634341 we must stop saddam from ever again jeopardizing the stability and the security of his neighbors with weapons of mass destruction
3634342 saddam will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has ten times since 1983
3634343 the problem is not nuclear testing it is nuclear weapons the number of third world countries with nuclear capabilities seems to grow daily saddam husseins near success with developing a nuclear weapon should be an eye opener for us all
3634344 one of the most compelling threats we in this country face today is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction threat assessments regularly warn us of the possibility that iraq may acquire or develop nuclear weapons
3634345 if you dont believe saddam hussein is a threat with nuclear weapons then you shouldnt vote for me
3634346 serving on the intelligence committee and seeing day after day week after week briefings on saddams weapons of mass destruction and his plans on using those weapons he cannot be allowed to have nuclear weapons its just that simple the whole world changes if saddam ever has nuclear weapons
3634347 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
3634348 we urge you after consulting with congress and consistent with the u s constitution and laws to take necessary actions including if appropriate air and missile strikes on suspect iraqi sites to respond effectively to the threat posed by iraqs refusal to end its weapons of mass destruction programs
3634349 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
3634350 i will be voting to give the president of the u s the authority to use force if necessary to disarm saddam because i believe that a deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in his hands is a real and grave threat to our security without question we need to disarm saddam hussein
3634351 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
3634352 we begin with a common belief that saddam hussein is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them
3634353 we know that he has stored nuclear supplies secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
3634354 we are in possession of what i think to be compelling evidence that saddam hussein has and has had for a number of years a developing capacity for the production and storage of weapons of mass destruction
3634355 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3634356 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3634357 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3634358 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3634359 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3634360 the ramifications of this whole episode on me and my family have been devastating and the mayors actions and the superintendents public silence has forced me to recognize that i have neither the trust confidence or respect of the mayor nor the superintendent
3634361 i have at all times tried to fair and honest with the students the faculty the staff and the community
3634362 at all times i have done what i have felt was in the best interests of the high school
3634363 dr sullivan will long be remembered in gloucester for the many individual families he helped over the past 10 years i wish him all the best in his retirement
3634364 ive got no reports of any border incidents any cross border incidents so it wasnt us
3634365 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan
3634366 the agreement would fall apart in the case japan violates the agreement and does not act as demanded under the agreement
3634367 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
3634368 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
3634369 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
3634370 moreover the vehicle for the cyberbullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000
3634371 the more the chinese become dependent on the rest of the world the more the rest of the world has influence
3634372 i dont think we should legitimize their government which oppresses people
3634373 of course youre going to root for the american team
3634374 i hope that this investigation makes steady progress and leads to the quick return of the victims to japan
3634375 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3634376 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3634377 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl
3634378 unfortunately this designation doubles down on a patently absurd approach
3634379 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3634380 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3634381 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
3634382 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
3634383 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
3634384 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
3634385 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
3634386 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
3634387 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
3634388 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
3634389 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
3634390 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
3634391 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
3634392 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
3634393 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
3634394 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
3634395 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
3634396 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3634397 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3634398 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3634399 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3634400 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3634401 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
3634402 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

3634407 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3634408 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3634409 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3634410 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3634411 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3634412 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3634413 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3634414 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3634415 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3634416 the forest service in an attempt to bolster an outgoing presidents environmental legacy rammed through an environmental agenda that itself violates the countrys well established environmental laws
3634417 it is not in any way overturned or compromised by judge brimmers decision in wyoming today
3634418 what it does do is create two conflicting court decisions in different federal courts different states both issuing decisions with nationwide impact
3634419 in light of the potential harm the roadless rule poses to our national forests due to beetle infestation and forest fires

3634421 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high

3634458 we did not achieve our ambitious target of moving across five million customers before the end of june
3634459 we will migrate five million by the end of september and well be moving from five to seven million by the end of the year
3634460 i cant give you a number off the top of my head because youll quote me on it and next year youll say sol you said thered be this many
3634461 that process is going to begin in the month of august and will be part of both tr1 and tr2 as we think about the systems the business side will continue into the next calendar year
3634462 some of us were brand new to the company and in october we did an inventory with people that had been here 20 to 30 years with telstra and we identified we had 1250 systems
3634463 as we got into it six nine twelve months later we found out we had 1 500 systems
3634464 theres a lot of complexity to this and the variability of plus or minus ten or twenty months that could be part of the story
3634465 theyre going to be close whether were off by five to ten to twenty here or there i dont know whether thats going to be the case
3634466 the second half of the year youll start seeing a bit of a diminution but itll be close to that figure
3634467 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault

3634471 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3634472 we are human when it comes down to it we make mistakes and it came down to china had a better day today give us another day we could probably come out on top

3634498 the administrations blatant attempt to slide pay raises under the radar by submitting them after the completion of the budget process
3634499 the company does continue to experience strong demand for its retirement living and aged care accommodation and has 70 new units due for completion between now and december 2008
3634500 these new units which are supported by strong pre sales are expected to underpin earnings and cash flows in the current financial year
3634501 demand across the portfolio remains firm with over 22 million in reservations and pre sales presently in place
3634502 this provides us with a firm footing to commence the new financial year
3634503 across our portfolio of 21 villages we presently have 15 villages operating above our long term occupancy rate of 95 per cent including four operating at 100 per cent capacity
3634504 lack of available stock remains an issue at some villages
3634505 looking to fiscal 2009 conditions remain challenging but we expect earnings growth for the sixth consecutive year
3634506 the outcome was very pleasing in the light of financial market turmoil that resulted in slowing initial public offerings and merger and acquisition activity and substantial falls in northern hemisphere interest rates

3634508 i feel very excited because we sacrificed a lot to win this gold medal and this is a direct competition between the chinese team and the usa team and we are very proud that we won

3634515 we can if we want to and if weve got more desire and determination hopefully we come away with a win
3634516 last year we didnt play too good over there and i suppose they wanted it more their contested ball and tackling was better than ours they moved it better but this seasons a different season and were looking forward to the contest
3634517 us four young ruckmen this year have been really good at looking forward to contests like that hille
3634518 the attitude we go in with is to learn from those experiences and if we get beaten learn from it if we beat him learn from it as well
3634519 earlier in the year when we were both sitting in the stands and watching kurt and jon griffin go at it that makes you more determined to train harder
3634520 when you get the opportunity it makes you value your position in the side a lot more so since weve come in weve made sure the opportunity hasnt slipped
3634521 the good thing about this year is weve bonded really well especially the young guys coming through and the mateship between us is really strong and you can see it in the way were playing
3634522 given their growing market share and growing service revenue per user its clear customers do see value
3634523 the growth numbers also shows the power of the incumbent youve already got the customer relationships so its easier to sell them added value
3634524 were going to focus on winning the 3g game and were going to focus on post paid customers
3634525 optus was caught napping and their roll out is still very slow
3634526 its going to be a year at least before theres any real competition telstra has a nice year of making hay while the sun shines
3634527 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3634528 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3634529 sir conditions in china have changed beyond recognition since i worked there in the early 1960s despite unhelpful distractions such as chairman maos cultural revolution remarkable progress has been made
3634530 to human rights campaigners i say back off a little and allow further change to evolve from within
3634531 i do not believe that it is a problem that needs to be solved i actually think county government is working quite well
3634532 an important part of the synod of the serbian orthodox church has been schooled financed and spent considerable time in the greek churches and monasteries and has remained under their influence
3634533 the thoughts of the sky channel team are with matthew and his family and we wish him a speedy recovery sky channel appreciates the support of australian olympic committee 2gb and the australian embassy for their care of matthew
3634534 ive received calls from lots of racing people today jockeys trainers and owners wanting to know how matthew is faring his progress since starting as a racecaller has been quite spectacular he has won a million hearts and is highly respected
3634535 is vulnerable to adversaries who seek information about our nations homeland defense programs classified or unclassified
3634536 any real or possible contacts with foreign intelligence services terrorists or foreign criminal enterprises
3634537 we conservatives believe that you dismissed our serious quest for responsible limited government
3634538 in your quest for the presidency we want to know if it is in you to become a passionate and forceful leader with a conservative agenda to fight the lure of socialistic programs promoted by sen barack obama
3634539 she is attending and there was some sort of clerical error in which somebody said she was hosting but she is not
3634540 why did she allow barack obama to quietly list her as co host of a washington fundraiser at a tony restaurant in august because she thought louisianans might not notice
3634541 senators especially those running for re election dont get listed as fundraising co hosts for presidential candidates by accident
3634542 i can assure you that it had nothing to do with a kennedy e mail about it
3634543 its a great moment of spontaneity and political manipulation all in one
3634544 bryan had a big opportunity but he missed it because he was afraid of losing his base
3634545 but i just couldnt bring myself to pull the lever and vote for you
3634546 because i dont think theres a lot of stigma in saying youre voting for john mccain
3634547 do you want to vote for the white guy or the black guy
3634548 the real frailty of our polls is that we get very high refusal rates and we survive because the people who we interview are like the people who we dont interview on most things
3634549 and to be honest with you this is something every pollster i know is concerned about
3634550 it was clear that people were having the first opportunity to vote for an african american and there was uncertainty
3634551 you know is he going to be fair is he just going to look out for his own people and who are his own people i think weve come a great distance from that ive seen the progress
3634552 racial attitudes and stereotypes that people in many cases are not aware they have
3634553 i dont think anyone is correct or incorrect including me
3634554 to get to the heart of that youd have to do the kinds of research that havent been done
3634555 i wouldnt want to be barack obama and up two points going into election day
3634556 made a stabbing motion and i could see his arms cutting
3634557 joe was asking him questions where did he get the phone was he placing ieds was he taliban
3634558 he basically said master sgt newell had a screw loose
3634559 for years fema resisted acknowledging the problem or seeking funds for remediation
3634560 we are committed to upholding our obligations to remediate remove or upgrade them as necessary
3634561 we believe in adhering to any relevant environmental rule or law and will do so
3634562 the numbers of those displaced by this conflict will increase every day
3634563 their needs are basic and pressing food water shelter blankets and medical care
3634564 mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3634565 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when the convention program will focus on renewing americas economy
3634566 mark warner is the future of the democratic party and putting him on tuesday night with hillary clinton is exactly right move for obama
3634567 i think the bottom line is we lost focus we did and that focus is coming back
3634568 i think fundamentally our service is sound it doesnt mean were perfect and we certainly have work to do things to fix fences to mend
3634569 it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
3634570 subsequent statements have been a reflection of events on the ground
3634571 theres no question the one relative strength mccain has in the polls is on national security so every chance he gets every way he gets he tries to turn the conversation in that direction
3634572 if anybody were paying attention it might help mccain marginally
3634573 who are absorbed with our own war with our own economic crisis
3634574 russian president dmitry medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term consequences
3634575 i wholeheartedly condemn the violation of georgias sovereignty i think it is important at this point for all sides to show restraint and to stop this arms conflict georgias territorial integrity needs to be preserved and now is the time for direct talks
3634576 the restraint on both sides argument is not very smart its true on one level but its not the right thing to say first
3634577 i dont think it necessarily hurts obama but i think mccain has been vindicated
3634578 not everything is by the weave of the wool some is opposite they have won the fight submit and bow lower weep not you who are beaten but weep you who are unbeaten let us show tolerance and in this at least we shall be human gradually even green wood will burn god will grant salvation if we bear all with patience
3634579 the house has an icon corner but the conscience is for sale everyone makes the sign of the cross not everyone prays god sees every wrong he will not deceive you nor will you deceive him
3634580 the singing and celebration at moscow for the new wonderworker maximus fool for christ
3634581 every bomb we hope its going to be the last
3634582 they try to support us they understand us they come and say that you know we are really sorry and we are your friends and we are we are
3634583 because we russians remember those days when we were quite friendly i vacationed almost every summer on the black sea in georgia theyre great people so friendly
3634584 i hope intelligent russians are against their government and i think most russian americans support the georgians the russian government will always be the same even if its name changes
3634585 we need the whole country to be saved and all georgians to be alive
3634586 we said people are dying we cant sing and dance here
3634587 i still hope that everything is going to be ok
3634588 i wish i could go back there and be with them
3634589 i would not expect from russian government to be so greedy and to be so cruel
3634590 we all are georgians now and i believe the whole world should feel like that because if russia wins now in georgia that means that we all lose not only georgians
3634591 we kneel down before our warriors who have already given their lives
3634592 has faced the danger of war and a new wave of slander against our motherland from those who dont like russias historical choice
3634593 to pray that peace crowns all our trials as soon as possible and peace sets in between two orthodox peoples of the caucasus georgians and ossetians
3634594 we ask god and the holy virgin to stop the bloodshed so that our country as well as ossetia georgia the caucasus and the entire world could enjoy peace and prosperity

3634603 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
3634604 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3634605 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3634606 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3634607 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3634608 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3634609 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3634610 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3634611 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3634612 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3634613 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3634614 ive seen cars get high centered people going the wrong way people trying to dodge
3634615 salvation belongs to our god who sits on the throne and to the lamb
3634616 when teens had higher accident and fatality rates than other drivers the legislature created the graduated drivers licenses requirement so teens could become safer and better drivers im working with senate staff attorneys to determine the merits of creating a similar program for hunting
3634617 this discrepancy doesnt make sense its just not reasonable to allow a child younger than 14 to hunt while requiring an age restriction of 14 and above to target shoot
3634618 as the states population grows and use of outdoor recreational areas increases we must be sure were doing everything we can to protect all users
3634619 its not what you take but what you leave behind
3634620 we were thousands of miles from guant namo arguing lofty principles before the supreme court
3634621 then they call us up and say ok now theyre going to try him
3634622 im sitting with a guy who is accused of being a member of al qaida
3634623 im there to defend him to try to get him freed it wasnt so academic anymore
3634624 he was the driver who drove where he was told
3634625 no ha pasado nada de hecho lesley no quer a que arrestasen a alan hayden estaba fuera cuando su padre fue arrestado y luego ste la llam desde la c rcel ellos se mucho quieren el uno al otro y quieren que todos sepan que a los problemas se les ha dado una importancia desproporcionada
3634626 they would go in a pack of five six seven of them
3634627 every now and then theyd get out and bark at me but id just tell them to behave
3634628 conspired with certain military personnel to torture prisoners kept at the abu ghraib hard site
3634629 represented a potential threat to public safety and therefore was not a suitable candidate
3634630 animals who present aggressive behaviors towards other animals or to people including animals that attack other animals are a serious threat to public safety
3634631 they didnt give buddy a fair chance to even make it out of the shelter alive
3634632 i really think the jurors found evidence presented to them very compelling

3634635 we save a lot of banks by being able to work with them avoiding failures that would be costly to the insurance fund
3634636 the only ones that people see are the ones that fail
3634637 in some of these cases i believe regulators should act sooner than later to prevent future losses to the fund
3634638 ask yourself why would a borrower be interested in a lender thats three states away its probably because theyre having difficulty getting loans from banks that really know that community
3634639 while the banks are suffering theyre well capitalized and we wouldnt expect to see failures here
3634640 we do not yet have a peace deal we have a provisional cessation of hostilities but this is significant progress
3634641 the difference between lunatics and other people is that when they smell blood it is very difficult to stop them
3634642 we will be forced to take other measures to prevent any repetition of the situation that emerged because of the outrageous georgian aggression
3634643 plain and simple blatant aggression on the part of russia
3634644 they shot their brother russian peacekeepers then they finished them off with bayonets so we are not going to see them there any more
3634645 there are a few things that need to be discussed to get a full ceasefire
3634646 the russians are saying that they will never again accept georgians in any form in south ossetia they see them as a trojan horse that started the attacks last week
3634647 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
3634648 abkhazia and ossetia if i mention territorial integrity are to the best of my knowledge part of georgia
3634649 nato is not seeking a direct role or a military role in this conflict
3634650 require the signing of a legally binding treaty on the non use of force
3634651 why are people waving flags its not as if we won
3634652 i wonder why he did it he has only 10 000 soldiers and he takes on russia
3634653 this is not the russia of 93 or 94 a terribly weakened russia
3634654 the russians are now negotiating from a position of strength
3634655 weve been working on georgia for four years and weve failed everyones guilty but putin is playing his cards brilliantly he knows exactly what hes doing and the consequences are all negative
3634656 this was a proxy war not about south ossetia but about moscow drawing a red line for the west
3634657 they marched into georgia to challenge the west and the west was powerless were dealing with a new russia
3634658 russian soldiers have been in south ossetia and abkhazia for 15 years the outcome of the negotiations will probably be the entrenchment of the russian presence in both of the enclaves
3634659 what can have an impact on the russians without damaging us more than them
3634660 this is the first time ever that an american presidents request was rejected because france and germany stuck together
3634661 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia i urge the nato allies to revisit the decision
3634662 a country that has such problems and is led by a hot headed militant does not belong in nato
3634663 it could take the whole alliance hostage and start the third world war
3634664 the spectrum of views in the e u is very wide it ranges from cold warriors to appeasers
3634665 close to putins position this war has pushed georgia further away from europe
3634666 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3634667 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3634668 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3634669 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3634670 we believe these concerns merit your immediate attention as apm and goldbelt entered into unapproved agreements that resulted in millions of dollars in 8 a revenues being paid to companies owned by their two managers
3634671 based on concerns raised by the government accountability office and congress that anc owned firms may be serving as conduits for large businesses the audit is examining the percentage of 8 a contract revenues reaching alaska natives
3634672 she kicked him and his bed out into the street in the middle of the night and it was barking all night and the police came and got it
3634673 the evidence we gathered clearly showed there was negligence on his part and no intent of a shooting
3634674 we believe some animals were left behind that were not fed and some of the puppies got to him not intentionally attacked him but used him as a food source
3634675 she was a very valuable member of our staff it was a blow to lose her
3634676 we at the school district are focused on providing our students with new classrooms and improved facilities
3634677 we want to allow them the opportunity to back down
3634678 a design that has the least environmental impact on that campus
3634679 theyre showing up offensively theyre more relaxed it looks like theyre having a lot of fun and enjoying themselves things tend to go your way when that happens
3634680 i think its all due to my legs my strength is back ive been taking care of my knee doing my exercises and getting the treatment that i need its taken a long time but im glad its to the point where i feel very strong with my back leg
3634681 i threw him some good changeups the first at bat he must have been looking for that changeup
3634682 everything was working tonight i just had that one bad inning and one bad pitch really
3634683 after you go through them two or three times theres a chance theyre going to get you
3634684 average winter bee losses due to poor weather and disease vary from between 5 and 10 so a 30 loss is deeply worrying this spells serious trouble for pollination services and honey producers
3634685 we dont know why there is a difference and what is behind the high mortality
3634686 30 fewer honeybee colonies could therefore cost the economy some 50 million 100 million and put at risk the governments crusade for the public to eat five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day
3634687 we are working with the u k bee farmers association and are sponsoring research to the minimum value of 25 000 50 000 over the next 12 months to selectively breed a hardier bee that can better withstand parasites and diseases
3634688 we do not deny that honeybee health is at risk frankly if nothing is done about it the honeybee population could be wiped out in 10 years
3634689 research is vital into varroa bee breeding and the nosema parasite
3634690 we are talking about food security and world food supplies being put at risk
3634691 significant public funds are already provided to support this area of work but to ensure this intervention is effective it it vital that work is driven by a well thought out strategy agreed by all relevant parties
3634692 he was really the father of the modern washington state patrol
3634693 will bachofner understood long before other chiefs that a police agency must reflect the community it serves
3634694 he served ably and with dignity he will be remembered for his bravery in the line of duty and skillful leadership
3634695 i decided to launch a 100 town tour of the state we needed cash so while we waited for movie theaters to clear their schedules we started playing town halls granges and old opera houses you can rent most of them for 50 and set up the show in less than an hour and you take home all the cash at the end of the night
3634696 its far better you come clean now than we have to chase it up second tax commissioner jennie granger said
3634697 we genuinely prefer not to have to cure afterwards prevention is the key ms granger said
3634698 it is better to come forward if you have got a problem because we will be following it up
3634699 its far better you come clean now than we have to chase it up second tax commissioner jennie granger said
3634700 however our study shows that the crucial feature is being outdoors irrespective of the activity you are doing dr rose said
3634701 our results show that the protective effect of time spent outdoors persists even if a child is doing a lot of near work such as reading and studying dr rose said
3634702 promoting outdoor activity to parents and families and including more outdoor pursuits in school curricula could be an important public health measure to avoid the development of myopia prof mitchell said
3634703 this public health message would be particularly relevant in those countries where the rates of myopia in children are very high such as in singapore and taiwan
3634704 in one word film is heavy its gone just gone
3634705 the accc considers that the information to be extracted from the trial has the potential to deliver benefits to the public by assisting governments to determine the most effective way to achieve their goal of reducing plastic bag consumption nationally accc chairman graeme samuel said
3634706 you dont find as much originality in sundance films these days and for a simple reason in the beginning the festival was a home for the homeless for a rambunctious outlaw take on filmmaking there was no need to be cautious since indie films were rarely hits but as sundance became the showcase for a form of movie gaining marketplace pull young directors naturally made films to fit the new mold trying to get your intellectual fill with sundance films is like choosing homemade popcorn over the concession stand variety higher quality little nourishment
3634707 anna nicoles mama said i wont wanna see anna fall down again
3634708 the government is finally stepping up and saying theyre going to take care of business and get these people what they deserve
3634709 the frustration was not knowing why i was being denied citizenship
3634710 if this is the case they need to move immediately and determine if im a threat not just sit on it for four years
3634711 this suggestion that plaintiffs should be resigned to participate vicariously in civic society is shocking offensive and wrong
3634712 the governments argument also flies in the face of the supreme courts repeated conclusion that the right to vote is the most basic and fundamental of our constitutionally protected rights
3634713 to win an olympic gold medal you cant have those delays in your pedal strokes the whole idea with this device is she can slam into the gears and she wont have to think about it
3634714 because of the nature of this course the big ring to the small ring is a big drop
3634715 she waited for all of us at the halfway point
3634716 she said the third eye worked great she tried to get the chain to drop but couldnt her confidence level while shifting really went up
3634717 we are all in disbelief at this tragic end to such a bright light in our community
3634718 not only was gregory a teacher at seabury but also a parent and great friend to us all we will miss him very much
3634719 advancements in fabric technology have given this years olympic swimmers an advantage that they didnt have four years ago
3634720 technology keeps advancing and fashion will go hand in hand with competitive sports for as far as the future can see
3634721 they actually swim faster with these suits on than they would if they were naked
3634722 in my mind its ok if i have to spend a little more because i really want to go for the experience
3634723 but im going to have to live kind of frugally during the fall semester so that i can afford to be over there
3634724 even if students have some kind of financial aid that doesnt help them with the cost of living
3634725 studying abroad is a transformative experience but students really have to sock away money or count on the largess of their families to help them out
3634726 it used to be that these programs were seen as an add on but increasingly were seeing campuses that are looking at study abroad as a key part of undergraduate education
3634727 we havent had drastic pullouts but there are some students whove had to change their plans
3634728 theres anecdotal evidence that the numbers of students studying abroad may either hold or decrease
3634729 the euro is whats killing everyone because about 70 percent of our students end up studying in europe
3634730 and everything is less expensive than in the states theres inexpensive fruit 23 cent baguettes and its easy and relatively cheap to travel in country
3634731 theyre choosing so called nontraditional destinations like latin america the african continent and south asia thats been a silver lining of this process
3634732 our national leaders are looking at this as something that we cant cut back on and must invest in
3634733 its an expensive academic program to run but one that pays great dividends
3634734 i wanted to do a triathlon before i was 50
3634735 after you get older you want to prove more things to yourself mentally and physically you want to stay younger so you push the envelope
3634736 but for most of them its a life experience in a sports venue
3634737 its all about what i can do not about anybody else
3634738 pretty cool ive had people say i am an inspiration to them
3634739 i carried that across the finish line anything is possible
3634740 no no no dont lay that religious stuff on me
3634741 and the next thing i know im being introduced that way at the spectrum in philly
3634742 wed get together the night before a session to write and we liked to have the artists present especially sam and dave because we fed off them we tailored songs to them
3634743 youre dealing with raw truth and believe it or not country and western and soul music are first cousins because its the voice of the common folk
3634744 nunca hablo de aquel tour ni siquiera con mi mujer

3634747 every commandment which i command you today you must be careful to observe that you may live and multiply and go in and possess the land of which the lord swore to your fathers and you shall remember that the lord your god led you all the way these forty years in the wilderness to humble you and test you to know what was in your heart whether you would keep his commandments or not
3634748 these three simple measures that would cost londons community charge payers nothing enormously assist cyclists and require absolutely no transport position papers
3634749 it sounded really interesting getting to make what you designed in your head
3634750 people are really interested in enrichment for their children more than just having fun they really want them to learn some of these girls may not be fashion designers but they may decide they want to work in the industry
3634751 with our camp theres a wonderful feeling of hand making things as parents we love the idea theyre doing these homey activities
3634752 parents are interested in getting their kids started on career exploration a lot earlier kids too are thinking more about what they want in the future
3634753 and its more fun this way you might as well go to camp for something that interests you
3634754 a lot of activity and a lot of it outdoors
3634755 its important for parents to ask the question what does my child really need
3634756 they need to make a decision for themselves and their child about whats the best way to test interests do i need a sampler kind of experience or am i so experienced that i can take all day doing one thing
3634757 they watch a lot of tv they think the same person goes to the crime scene and collects the evidence and interrogates the suspects this shows them what the work is really like
3634758 they see the work can be tedious and you have to be thorough
3634759 its fun to see them find a piece of hidden evidence they get so excited
3634760 on the opposite end if you drop a gum wrapper they think its related
3634761 i figured this was as real as it was going to get
3634762 if i like this then this is a possible career
3634763 when kids go to a general camp they start to develop interests in certain areas
3634764 the key is that its not that families are choosing specialty camps as a replacement to general camp especially for the younger kids
3634765 theres been a growth spurt in camps in the last 10 years we saw the enrollments going up in general camps and specialty camps followed
3634766 it used to be camp was designed to focus on athletics and if you werent an athletic child you still ended up in an athletic camp

3635007 puasa dan quran itu nanti di hari kiamat memintakan syafaat seseorang hamba puasa berkata ya allah aku telah mencegah dia memakan makanan dan menyalurkan syahwatnya di siang hari maka berilah aku hak untuk memintakan syafaat baginya dan berkata pula al quran ya allah aku telah mencegah dia tidur di malam hari karena membacaku maka berilah aku hak untuk memintakan syafaat baginya maka keduanya diberi hak untuk memintakan syafaat
3635008 tidak boleh hasad iri kecuali dalam dua perkara yaitu orang yang dikaruniai allah lalu diamalkannya pada waktu malam dan siang dan orang yang dikaruniai allah harta lalu diinfakkannya pada waktu malam dan siang

3635010 i was held by my shoulders i was grabbed very forcefully i could not get out of that hold and i was shaken so hard that my head was going back and forth so many times giving me whiplashes and pain and i saw in front of me a face full of rage and hatred i could not understand what was going on

3635017 you dont want me to hang these here because you know that i am a better person than you are
3635018 no no i dont want cheese i cant see cheese i cant eat cheese i am allergic to cheese take the cheese away from me
3635019 fearing that he would have an allergic reaction to cheese
3635020 i told him that all the grapes that we had on the plane were plated with cheese and if he was allergic to cheese it was my duty to let him know that
3635021 from the moment you have come on board you have been nothing but demeaning and verbally abusive both to myself and my flying partner
3635022 then you should treat me with respect as a human being and not verbally abuse me

3635030 serious concerns about the core competencies of the persons who constructed the document they dont know counter intelligence and more importantly they dont understand covert action intelligence operations especially secret para military operations
3635031 thanks to former cia counter terror case officer leutrell osborne the story had been brought to his attention by his son and had fortunately been saved in its original form before it was sanitized of several key sentences
3635032 yesterday at the headquarters of central intelligence service in langley a confidential meeting between one of the deputy directors of cia and a special messenger of russian intelligence service took place according to newsru sources he delivered to his american colleagues some documents including audio tapes with telephone conversations directly relating to terrorist attacks on washington and new york last tuesday according to these sources russian intelligence agents know the organizers and executors of these terrorist attacks more than that moscow warned washington about preparation to these actions a couple of weeks before they happened
3635033 when i left the cia in 1984 i thought the afghan war was one of the few successful cia covert action intelligence operations i thought the us had given the soviet union its vietnam when i began my research after 9 11 i realized the blowback began in 1993 with characters such as ramzi yousef amil kanzi and the 19 arabs in 9 11 they fit the mold of characters getting back at the hands that feed them meaning acts against the usa russian foreknowledge demonstrated russian intelligence operations were still collecting and reporting on arabs from the afghan war
3635034 the false flag mossad led operation and us supported 9 11 model has greater probability than some arab grown non nation state theme that the public has been spoon fed by the overt action operating elements of the us government before blindly accepting the alleged smoking gun lets monitor events closely to follow the trends we should continue to press sources for truth motive and due diligence

3635057 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3635058 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3635059 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3635060 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3635061 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3635062 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3635063 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3635064 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3635065 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3635066 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3635067 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3635068 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3635079 az horse land for sale by owner arizona ranch property
3635080 i think that there is no single answer to this dilemma
3635081 increasing the number of women in media changing policies and increasing public funding for media and the inclusion by media companies of gender policies and mechanisms to put them in place might help solve the problem and contribute to parity in media
3635082 media is tough job and it is not for sissies
3635083 i am not a sexist or a conservative person as i would like to see gender parity in media but i am just concerned about the not so mentally tough attitude of our female colleagues who often fail to get it right all the times
3635084 it is not something new in our society everywhere in the world there is still a lot of negative and pessimistic attitudes to see gender equality prevail
3635085 general prejudice exists all over the place and this is something that will never be solved in our lifetime we as artisans of this historical process of self determination need to prepare our children to carry on with fighting for change
3635086 and we have to lead the way and do it with conviction and passion media people are a symbol of enlightenment and my view about social change is that it has to start with people who are there who will build on what they already have but it is a long and complex struggle

3635095 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
3635096 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
3635097 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
3635098 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

3635159 you have failed you were not prepared as i had hoped i am sorry but you have left me no choice
3635160 a few years back i was taking a theology course and the professor recommended only the books whose authors he agreed with
3635161 thus all doctrines should be seen in terms of their practical value for living the christian life
3635162 a long tail and a long neck and was 10 15 metres in length with an appearance like a very large wallaby and having a head like a turtles head it walked slowly on two legs and had smooth shiny brown skin the top of the head was estimated to be as high as a house and the underbelly of the creature was as high as an adult
3635163 no skull material has ever been found that could indicate its diet
3635164 a long neck and a long tail and had a total length of about 20 metres and a width of about 2 metres the head was described as being like a dinosaur with an oval like face the top of the legs of the animal were visible above the water with the water being used to support the weight of the animals body the skin of the animal was described as being like a crocodile and was khaki green in colour dermal frills possibly indicating the animal is a male could be seen on the creatures back extending to the back of the head something was observed protruding from the back of the creatures head the creatures neck was almost horizontal during the sighting details of the creatures eye and mouth could not be determined as the observers were about 30 to 40 metres from the animal the sighting occurred for less than 30 seconds until the reptile sunk into the water no sound could be heard from the creature by the observers the creature has not been observed since this sighting in 2005
3635165 the only known animal that fits the description of this animal is a sauropod dinosaur such as an apatosaurus
3635166 this is not the first time that dinosaur like creatures have reportedly been sighted in papua new guinea if ever a living dinosaur is found and confirmed to the satisfaction of the scientific fraternity many people would be astonished given the prevailing evolutionary view that dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago
3635167 christians however should not be surprised as the bible teaches that god created the dinosaurs only around 6 000 years ago so we neednt be too taken aback if a theropod or sauropod dinosaur is ever confirmed to be living in the world today
3635168 there are a number of places where it appears that dinosaurs or other similar creatures are mentioned in the scriptures
3635169 the prophet ezekiel likens pharaoh to a sea monster that invaded the nile river and stirred up the mud ezekiel 32 2
3635170 job is the oldest book in the bible this book is very interesting from a scientific perspective because of the many natural phenomena that are addressed by god job and his friends
3635171 along the way god points job to two special creatures
3635172 see how big and thick the dinosaurs tail is and look how it dwarfs the tiny skinny tails of the hippo and the elephant see it would be impossible for the hippo or the elephant with small puny tails to be the behemoth job because the bible says the behemoths tail is a lot like a ceder tree just like the large thick massive tails of sauropod dinosaurs so therefore the behemoth job saw in the book was a sauropod dinosaur because his tail is lot like a ceder tree
3635173 in fact pygmy peoples in equatorial africa tell stories of a ferocious dinosaurian creature that occupies their swamps and rivers and lashes its opponents with its tail
3635174 maybe we have yet to discover the remains of a leviathan
3635175 lastly there is some paleontological evidence that a skull arrangement could have accommodated
3635176 hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone are contained in separate chambers in the beetles abdomen from where it can be ejected to confront a predator with an explosive mixture reaching 212 f
3635177 in psalm 92 10 the re em has but one horn while the language or deuteronomy 33 17 implies two horns
3635178 although most commentators and modern versions translate it as a bull or rhino some have theorized that re em might be a monoclonious single horned dinosaur like triceratops
3635179 in his classic work naturalis historia the first century author pliny the elder described
3635180 but a rhino does not stab with its horn which is actually composed of keratin hair
3635181 in a recent expedition made by roy mackal a biologist and a cryptozoologist pygmies in cameroon identified the horned creature there called ngoubou with a ceratopsian dinosaur and claimed it could sport from one to four horns
3635182 in the authorized version of scripture we find isaiah twice mentioning the
3635183 the hebrew word mopheph jpvfm is a polal participle a form used only by isaiah when describing the reptilian saraph the polal indicates an intensive of the root pvf ooph that means to fly or flutter the imperfect form of the polal is found in genesis 1 20 flying creatures that flutter to and fro and isaiah 6 2 seraphim the same word as the reptiles here used for angelic creatures that fly to and fro
3635184 describes celestial beings that serve as guardians of the gods in ancient mythology
3635185 holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory
3635186 this same word is employed in numbers 21 6 to describe the poisonous reptiles that bit the murmuring israelites indeed it is easier to envision an attack of nimble flying snakes pterosaurs killing many of the children of israel rather than them being surprised and killed by snakes on the ground the pterosaur becoming a type of christ john 3 14 seems more appropriate than the snake which from genesis to revelation is a symbol of satan
3635187 in addition the spread wings on the top of the pole would form a cross in fact a plate found with sennacheribs booty at calah from the conquest of palestine depicts such a winged serpent on a pole that would seems to match the nehushtan or brazen saraph of moses that had become a symbol of worship by hezekiahs reign ii kings 18 4
3635188 it is my belief based on the biblical and archaeological evidence that the pterosaurs became cultural icons for judah after isaiahs vision in the year that king uzziah died 740 b c according to thiele
3635189 becoming cultural icons for judah after isaiahs vision in the year that king uzziah died
3635190 some cryptozoological reports from new guinea which attribute to alleged living pterosaurs a bioluminescent capability like a firefly
3635191 it would be silly hitching the train to something that has no track record to this point

3635216 in an era when anyone can be a reporter or commentator on the web you move to a two way journalism
3635217 one of the most highly touted features of the web 2 0 era is the rise of blogging if an essential part of web 2 0 is harnessing collective intelligence turning the web into a kind of global brain the blogosphere is the equivalent of constant mental chatter in the forebrain the voice we hear in all of our heads it may not reflect the deep structure of the brain which is often unconscious but is instead the equivalent of conscious thought and as a reflection of conscious thought and attention the blogosphere has begun to have a powerful effect
3635218 we are at the beginning of a golden age of journalism but it is not journalism as we have known it
3635219 someone who buys products or services from an individual or organization
3635220 the primary purpose of journalism is to provide citizens with the information they need to be free and self governing
3635221 the pioneering south korean news site posts hundreds of stories every day most are written by housewives schoolkids professors and other citizen journalists founder oh yeon ho says his site is changing the definition of journalism and who can be a journalist
3635222 the venerable profession of journalism finds itself at a rare moment in history where for the first time its hegemony as gatekeeper of the news is threatened by not just new technology and competitors but potentially by the audience it serves armed with easy to use web publishing tools always on connections and increasingly powerful mobile devices the online audience has the means to become an active participant in the creation and dissemination of news and information

3635229 an account of the rapid destruction of the grianan is given by mr godwin f s a in the april number of the architect for 1872 he states that at the time of his visit in march 1858 the masonry was in a very dilapidated condition owing in a great part to the labours of some gentleman who many years ago evinced more curiosity than care in searching after subterranean passages amp c since which time this interesting work of antiquity has deplorably suffered by the summer invasion of visitors from the neighbouring city indeed to such an extent that the drawings of the fort taken at the time of the ordnance survey have literally become matters of history for the inclined jambs the interior terrace with its steps the small central building and many other features of note which then existed are now no more these statements from reliable witnesses are sufficient to convince anyone that what had lain concealed and disregarded for centuries would by the unthinking careless and curious be soon reduced to nothing probably this work of spoliation might still have advanced with a more rapid pace inasmuch as newspaper writers of late years have been drawing the attention of the general public to the locality

3635387 when we begin a reputation management project we keep that case secret these other companies that talk about contacting web sites with legal notices and asking them to remove content are putting their clients at risk if someone has an article on a web site that is deemed negative press and a reputation management company writes the site owner a letter asking them to remove the story the site owner is more than likely going to blog about the first amendment injustice thus creating more negative press on the web for the client that is why we work in the shadows
3635388 if you have a beehive hanging on your door step and you take a stick then knock it down you are going to have a lot of angry bees swarming around but if you apply a layer of smoke around the beehive the problem can be peacefully remedied if you contact a blog owner or site owner you are asking for a lot of angry bees swarming the web to spread your bad news

3635406 personally speaking it was inspiring to see efforts and money put into the advancement of safe patient handling for the u s veteran and their caregivers i was excited to be part of the initiative
3635407 selecting the proper track layout for the facility was probably the most important thing to get straight
3635408 our choice was a full x y room covering system this specific configuration allows us to accomplish all bed transfers tasks fallen patient pick up repositioning and limb holding luckily the hospitals staff had a pretty firm idea what their needs were that helps us a lot they were a pleasure to work with throughout the project

3635415 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3635416 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3635417 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3635418 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3635419 an atheist is a person who believes there is no god
3635420 an atheist is a person who believes there is no god
3635421 an atheist is a person who does not believe in the existence of god
3635422 an agnostic is a person who believes it is impossible to know whether there is a god
3635423 an agnostic is a person who is unwilling to commit to a belief of the existence or nonexistence of god
3635424 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3635425 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3635426 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3635427 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3635428 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3635429 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3635430 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3635431 who are open to doing something on the production side
3635432 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3635433 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3635434 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3635435 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3635436 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3635437 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3635438 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3635439 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3635440 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3635441 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3635442 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3635443 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3635444 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3635445 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3635446 as my partner rick and i traveled to different sales territories we harvested the same industry demands of mdu space constraints and flexibility of media room seating requirements
3635447 our mdu line offers our dealers and their clientele innovative solutions to space limitations while offering sublime ergonomic comfort
3635448 since the beginning we have been building custom solutions the mdu line allows us to showcase our ability to shrink our furniture much as we were able to offer enlarged version of our furniture as in our titan line designed for the professional athlete
3635449 the entire industry is working together towards sustainability rather than focusing on gaining a competitive advantage through intelligence
3635450 our vision is to develop buildings that are carbon negative and lower the overall impact of the energy grid
3635451 people tend to focus on cars but buildings are key and a critical component to curbing global warming
3635452 sustainability is a wise business practice in an environment of increasing energy costs and is the first step toward preserving the environment for future generations
3635453 the bluestar executive one on one cocktail reception held at rspas retailnow show this year was a great success it allowed attending vendors to discuss business strategies face to face with value added resellers
3635454 mpact is very excited about winning the 15 000 fusion business development package at the rspa show this will help us to put together and initiate our first major effort at marketing weve been in the industry for 15 years and have only run a yellow pages ad that whole time we have essentially depended on word of mouth prior to this weve been a bluestar customer for several years and are looking at using bluestars fusion to push our proprietary casino product
3635455 we were very impressed with the caliber of people we met from bluestar during the recent 2008 retailnow event and were equally impressed with the products and services offered as a brand new customer winning the toshiba tec system was the icing on the cake we hope to develop a successful business relationship with bluestar going forward
3635456 our one on one executive reception at rspa enabled bluestar as a solution based distributor to offer our value added resellers a wonderful venue to discuss bundled hospitality and retail business solutions with the executives of our hardware and software partners our global business development and marketing teams were present to assist our partners in registering for our fusion program which enables our value added resellers to custom design drip marketing campaigns to grow their business in their respective verticals and metro markets throughout the americas
3635457 the united states has 2 trillion barrels of oil shale
3635458 this is more than seven times the amount of crude oil reserves found in saudi arabia and is enough to meet current u s demand for over 250 years
3635459 the u s could completely end its dependence on opec by 2020
3635460 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3635461 we are asking that she bring our american energy act up for a vote
3635462 if she brings it up under regular order then amendments will be allowed and well have that debated what we want is a chance to have that debate and have a vote
3635463 ipnetzone has come to rely on linmin for both the provisioning and imaging of servers in our various co location sites
3635464 linmins new api will enable us to offer even better responsiveness to customer requests for additional and or differently configured linux and windows servers
3635465 having a best of breed provisioning and imaging solution was a great starting point but being a standalone product didnt maximize the potential of linmin bare metal provisioning now with the new linmin api customers can optimize it resources physical virtual and human around business processes not the other way around
3635466 linmins ability to install applications and management agents during the provisioning process is even more valuable with the api bringing a closed loop process to customers existing environments automatically select an appropriate and available physical or virtual system invoke the linmin api and after the system is provisioned these agents identify themselves to their respective management monitoring policy enforcement availability compliance and other applications that then take control of the system this is it application integration at its best
3635467 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3635468 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3635469 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3635470 we have established our new company here because we are convinced that the usa is the next country to develop a new large csp capacity far larger eventually than the one in spain the country and the different states seem to be convinced of the need to minimise the use of fossil fuels
3635471 and sener can offer here the technology and the experience we are developing with our plants in spain very unique technologies in some cases like the large capacity thermal storage and within the frame of an bankable epc contract that will facilitate limited recourse financing
3635472 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3635473 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3635474 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3635475 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3635476 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3635477 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3635478 like it or not our children are in a full scale battle where their health and their lives are at stake as parents we need to actively arm our children with valuable life lessons so they can flourish as adults thats why we created wisenhimer
3635479 wisenhimer takes childrens natural love of learning through creativity and discovery into the 21st century the most exciting feature of wisenhimer is that it teaches the user as they play children earn points and advance by learning about healthy living and practicing healthy habits in the real world
3635480 our team created the concept of the site but it was our children and their friends who actually refined the site to what it is today
3635481 they pushed us and the site is better for their efforts my nine year old son sam is one of the members of our childrens advisory team cat and my seven year old daughter sallie both gave us great insight into what was fun interesting and attractive for kids
3635482 aside from the workshops the conference gave us the exciting opportunity to be a featured guest speaker at a breakfast table presentation
3635483 entitled the shocking truth they dont want us to tell you you dont need an agency to succeed my presentation allowed me to talk with the attendees and provide them pointers with do it yourself initiatives for their online recruitment strategies as well as explain some of the benefits of working with an agency like emg
3635484 what was really great is that the attendees truly understood how vital bridging information technology strategy and business basically what emg does is to their institution
3635485 it was also impressive how this newer conference was right up our alley and that every single speaking engagement and lecture was relevant to the work we do at emg
3635486 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3635487 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3635488 it is a tremendous honor for the msr communications team to be named by the editorial community as one of the top five small pr firms in the nation

3635490 we were really impressed by the if teams ability to create compelling stories for the properties they work with
3635491 i think we have a great deal to learn from them and were looking forward to a successful partnership
3635492 bay creek is one of the most beautiful and peaceful properties ive ever had a chance to market and sell there are countless people all along the east coast who would love to reconnect with a simpler time with nature and with each other and our goal is to make sure that they know bay creek offers them the opportunity to do just that

3635495 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3635496 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3635497 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3635498 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3635499 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3635500 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3635501 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3635502 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3635503 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3635504 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3635505 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3635506 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3635507 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3635508 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3635509 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3635510 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3635511 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3635512 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3635513 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3635514 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3635515 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3635516 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3635517 nearly all of our clients are asking us what they should do about social ecommerce in 2009 this planning guide is the result of significant research and catalogs the best of what retailers are doing with social ecommerce to help our clients answer that question
3635518 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3635519 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3635520 working in a regulated environment dictates the need for a compliant training program to ensure that regulatory and key business goals are realized in a controlled manner
3635521 setting up a formalized training program that incorporates the essential elements provides assurance that employees are qualified and fully trained in the particular operations that they perform in accordance with the current good manufacturing practice cgmp and applicable global regulations
3635522 weve always maintained that ours is the largest dominos pizza franchise
3635523 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3635524 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3635525 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry
3635526 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
3635527 russia now flush with cash wants to rebuild its 19th century imperial sphere of influence in the former soviet union
3635528 it also wants to make an example out of georgia to other nato aspirants what the chinese call kill the chicken to take care of the monkey so the ukrainians will think russia would use force to prevent them from joining nato
3635529 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3635530 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3635531 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3635532 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3635533 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3635534 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3635535 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3635536 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3635537 throughout my years of experience in this sector ive witnessed how bluestar has emerged and developed into a powerful leader in the technology industry in the united states canada and soon enough in latin america and the caribbean
3635538 since joining bluestar n stor has introduced our suppliers to key vars in puerto rico and the caribbean islands
3635539 we are very pleased to have n stor talavera as part of our business development team we foresee an outstanding growth in our caribbean market with the implementation of n stors expertise and strategic tactics to approach new vars and enhance our relationship with our existing customers and vendors
3635540 when allen got shot i felt real sad but more than sad i just felt like doing anything to somebody who wasnt from deuce 8
3635541 i wish i knew who did it cause i would have did something before i got locked up but thats one reason ive thought about not being in a gang because i didnt want to have to do something cause what i was thinking about wasnt cool
3635542 shes a beautiful beautiful beautiful person in a very ugly position and i really feel for her
3635543 i think that i really have never known someone so insistent upon integrity and honesty and openness
3635544 but someone who has an affair with a married man you say has integrity and honesty
3635545 i think she thought that he had quite a bit of integrity and i think that that appealed to her about him sometimes we make mistakes sometimes we pick people to fall in love with that maybe arent the greatest choice at the time i cant judge her in that i cant fault her in that
3635546 a very keenly intellectually engaged woman shes very insistent upon rigorous dialogue

3635563 we face unique networking challenges when deploying on moving trains omnivex was able to address these challenges by interfacing with the evdo cellular network that the digital signage is managed through

3635565 i basically said heres my boring life on saturday nights its a double feature with my parents dinner and a movie
3635566 i was just tired of going out to bars to meet guys
3635567 rob now 29 said he had been looking at rings but couldnt decide on the right one kelly now 27 had worn her late grandmothers engagement ring on her right hand since the third grade that night the couple put it on her left hand and made plans to go ring shopping

3635569 that was the most important part of the day for us
3635570 although the tiniest bacterial cells are incredibly small weighing less than 10 12 grams each is in effect a veritable micro miniaturized factory containing thousands of exquisitely designed pieces of intricate molecular machinery made up altogether of one hundred thousand million atoms far more complicated than any machinery built by man and absolutely without parallel in the non living world
3635571 he was a brave soldier who made the greatest sacrifice anyone could make for everyone elses freedom
3635572 he realized that by being over there he was going to make a difference in the lives of those people
3635573 he always looked out for the other guy never thought of himself he volunteered to go to c co before our first deployment so that one of the guys from our platoon didnt have to deploy early and would have a chance to marry his fiance thats koch for you always looking out for his buddies
3635574 he had no problem he was dedicated to the fact that people over there needed help he was always concerned about other people he loved children he was a nice soft hearted kid

3635576 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3635577 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3635578 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3635579 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3635580 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3635581 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3635582 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3635583 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3635584 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3635585 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3635586 the london theater scene is stale theyre looking to shake things up weve always wanted to do a show where the actor had a singing voice that sound like the noise a fat guy makes when he lifts something heavy and this could be that magical time
3635587 hes a builder underwire and support are as important to him as rebar its all about stability and construction
3635588 trump was completely in the wrong the enquirer had photos of him swimming a couple months ago hes the one with the rack that needs remedial help
3635589 my strategy was not to go right to the limit in the climbs so that i could push on the descents
3635590 open standards and in particular semantic web standards can help lower the cost of government make it easier for independent agencies to work together and increase flexibility in the face of change publishing linked data on the web enables creative re use of it citizen mashups and commercial mashups which combine the data from many sources to stunning new uses

3635592 the petition lacks merit and is premature since no motion for reconsideration of the assailed order was filed prior to the availment of this special civil action and there are no sufficient allegations to bring the case within the recognized exceptions to this rule
3635593 in any event the petition failed to sufficiently show that the assailed judgment is tainted with grave abuse of discretion
3635594 with the san fernando bypass road extension motorists can travel in a safe and convenient manner ensuring satisfaction among our stakeholders through our thriving city and province
3635595 we were not actually playing against the georgian team we were playing against our brazilian friends here
3635596 if they were georgian they certainly would be influenced but they are not georgian
3635597 it was very stupid for georgia to start a war with russia because russia is very big and georgia very small
3635598 i feel like a georgian i have a georgian passport and a brazilian passport we have fought for the past two years to be here as one of the 24 teams
3635599 i dont want this to be a war between us i appreciate them and respect them as players
3635600 the muntinlupa city government will provide them financial assistance in addition to food blankets and other supplies that they need
3635601 this is the most important gold medal the great atmosphere here in china allowed everyone to be filled with enthusiasm and good morale
3635602 we really worked hard and we were well prepared but unfortunately we made two mistakes and you cant win a gold with two mistakes
3635603 its a disappointment totally because the fight was extremely close equal to equal two very strong teams unfortunately we had this break otherwise we would have come out the winner
3635604 mr bush please accept my regrets i am sure you understand there are some things that even a queen cannot control
3635605 your majesty do not give the matter another thought until you mentioned it i thought it was one of the horses
3635606 until the investigation is complete we cannot say what caused the fire or whether it was arson or accidental
3635607 the fumes were toxic because most of the burning materials were garments
3635608 you must indicate the nature of the pleadings parties case number and date filed for proper identification
3635609 in our master list we do indicate that but we will now do the same with our logbook as per your instruction
3635610 there is nothing in the rollo records of the case i cant find any transcript
3635611 it is the duty of the stenographer to attach the notes to the rollo of the case you do not find any
3635612 it appears that the rollo is always with justice roxas isnt it strange imagine if he has 300 cases and all the cases rollo are in his office how many justices in your division keep the rollo
3635613 imagine if the supreme court will ask for records of this case how can you comply if the rollo is with the justice what kind of performance is this and with so many pleadings submitted in this case all this is with justice roxas
3635614 corner shops in deprived areas of england are to be given money to help boost sales of beer the money is expected to be used to help buy new shelving chiller cabinets and promotional material to get people eating more healthily
3635615 its really not that big of an imposition to ask them to do this
3635616 but it is a mind set change to take that extra step of putting leftover food into our kitchen pail rather than the regular trash bin
3635617 i live in woodland hills and would do it in a heartbeat
3635618 first of all im concerned about the environment i think too much goes to waste and too much sits in landfills
3635619 it certainly covered some issues in which tokofsky was involved
3635620 im not really at liberty to discuss the confidential research project but suffice it to say it was not research done in connection with any election
3635621 a lot of people think when they give money to the office holder account it will help the local boys and girls club so im sort of shocked at what the office holder account ended up doing
3635622 my father was like you know what just let them do what they want if thats gonna get the kids to stop tagging
3635623 unfortunately this ordinance was not crafted with countywide consensus nor does it provide an acceptable standard of long term equity for all regions of los angeles county which will be paying this new sales tax
3635624 theres a stereotype that students from east l a dont want to finish high school and it was a chance to show everyone that we do want to go to college
3635625 we need more to be done we cannot let this lack of effective implementation continue
3635626 instead of things moving forward they seemed to have moved back hes probably going to have to do the same things i did
3635627 the students were saying set higher expectations for us and ill meet them
3635628 it was a huge deal probably one of the most important policy shifts in the district
3635629 there must have been an absence of checks and balances for this to occur
3635630 but there should be systems in place so they dont have such a dramatic effect on the departments efforts to take on such critical issues
3635631 the employee did not understand the ramifications of what she was doing and truthfully neither did anyone else thats the reality of a bureaucracy one clerk can cause something like this to happen
3635632 to the bureaucrat a thousand dollars is a line item to me it is a rape victim who wont know the identity of their attacker
3635633 this problem could have been averted by making dna testing a priority for the last several years the department needs to understand that scientists are just as important as officers

3635635 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3635636 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3635637 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3635638 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3635639 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3635640 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3635641 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3635642 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3635643 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3635644 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3635645 its a struggle going off to college not having your mother help you unpack
3635646 it was a struggle to focus to not think about her and the way that she died
3635647 i want to be the one to solve these cases
3635648 i think i started to learn how to motivate myself
3635649 it kind of felt good to do it for her because i couldnt do it for myself
3635650 im struggling to take care of myself and my sister financially and make sure we have what we need to continue in life
3635651 just to have something that we can call our own
3635652 its the only thing they cant take away from you
3635653 after owning race tracks and having race teams now i think its a side of me i really enjoy
3635654 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3635655 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3635656 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3635657 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3635658 i felt a little sick last night but i was up for the challenge and tried to get the best out of myself
3635659 it was so great for me to have her pushing me along
3635660 now i have got one of each colour so im happy
3635661 i knew her race tactics to race at a moderate pace and then really go for it
3635662 my coach told me to follow my instincts and that was the best way for me

3635664 i would absolutely be willing to allow the public to decide
3635665 its fodder for talk shows but does it accomplish anything
3635666 weve transformed a polluted eyesore into a vibrant retail center for a community much in need of retail opportunities
3635667 that does not even count the wages and other benefits that will accrue to the community
3635668 the downturn in real estate values has severely affected the companys ability to pay investors
3635669 this is incredibly stressful for mr rangel his concern is for the investors in his various companies

3635677 keane and torres are clever players they scored plenty of goals last season and when they have played a lot more games together for us they will score here too
3635678 these two strikers are top class and they can be at the level of anyone in this competition they will get better and better
3635679 they will need time it has been a difficult summer with players arriving for training at different stages but i have no worries about them in the future
3635680 liege are in good form they beat anderlecht last weekend in the belgian super cup and last season in their league they barely lost a game and went over 30 without defeat at one stage
3635681 this is the most extensive campaign of telemarketing calls to consumers on the do not call list ever investigated by my office
3635682 they invaded the homes of thousands of pennsylvania residents with unsolicited and unwanted phone calls marketing mortgage loans that they were not licensed to sell
3635683 this is a business matter that my son cory is working through with his attorney i have no involvement in his company
3635684 we believe that the younger ruppersberger was the sole proprietor of these businesses
3635685 very disturbing because were dealing with an extremely large violation of the do not call list
3635686 the majority of our cases deal with hundreds or thousands of calls
3635687 contact clients that arent being reached by other telemarketing lists because of dnc do not call scrubbing
3635688 it is my understanding that this particular company is on the federal trade commission list of major violators
3635689 if any of these entities are violating the federal do not call rule we want to know about it
3635690 as i pray for the guidance of the spirit and seek to rise to the responsibility which has been given me i dont ask for any special endowment i ask only to go where the lord would have me go and only to receive what the lord would have me receive knowing that more important than sight is the witness that one may have by the witness of the holy ghost to his soul that things are so and that jesus is the christ a living personage it is that which guides me through many of the experiences of life

3635695 the growth of latino communities in the second half of the twentieth century should have fostered significant increase in latino participation in the formal political process this was not the case because of their dissimilar culture latinos themselves were blamed for their own low levels of electoral participation baretto 297
3635696 latino elected officials think that it is more difficult to get people to believe in themselves to increase registration and turnout to persuade voters that latino candidates are qualified and trustworthy to develop a statewide political strategy to muster enough confidence to participate and to manage conflict among elites cruz 248

3635719 the loss of dale steyn after the second test was tough
3635720 he has been a huge performer for us during the year so it will be nice to see him hopefully performing well in the one dayers
3635721 it just makes us think a little more about what we need to do to beat australia
3635722 its about getting all things working in the same direction and getting the confidence up
3635723 there is no doubt that we have got the skills to be a lot better than what we are
3635724 i think they need him desperately in one day cricket
3635725 especially in the last couple of overs of the powerplays and then going through the middle period where guys are getting ones and twos if they get in they generally play it how they want it but hes the guy who can let you still attack as a captain
3635726 it would give you a totally different option to a lot of sides they dont have that
3635727 i think hes got a lot to offer in the one day set up but im not sure what his feelings are on that
3635728 i think the way they are thinking is that now is a perfect opportunity to keep him going for the rest of durhams championship campaign
3635729 he is not going to be bowling every day you dont want to overdo it but in general hes been under bowled
3635730 i think he does realise that and wants to keep on top of it wants to make sure hes in good form when he gets out and plays
3635731 i cant get the ball out of his hands which is amazing often the plan is to give him three or four overs nothing happens but he gets two wickets in his 13th which is just amazing credit to him
3635732 a lot of guys have maybe questioned his heart or whatever when the teams needed him and hes either been a bit off the boil or just maybe a lack of confidence at times
3635733 but when it comes to major situations against really good players he wants to be involved
3635734 hes never shied out of any competition he really backs himself which is something you cant coach or teach

3635946 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3635947 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit

3635970 u s food and drug administration fda confirmed that concerns had been raised after the cases of the 20 girls who had received gardasil and who had later died were reported to the vaccine adverse event reporting system
3635971 we all know any drug any vaccine can cause complications and before you require that an entire general population receive it people should at least be aware of what kinds of complications could come from it
3635972 there needs to be research to see if there is a connection but with that number of complaints and with so many of them being serious complaints this ought to give pause to any legislator before he even considers mandating that every little girl get a shot of this vaccine
3635973 before the shot i was fine and there is no reason i should have had a stroke

3635982 the claw is extended by pushing up under the footpad or by grasping it with allis tissue forceps a scalpel blade is used to sharply dissect between the second and third phalanx over the top of the ungual crest the distal interphalangeal joint is disarticulated disjointed and the deep digital flexor tendon is incised severed the digital footpad is not incised if a nail trimmer is used the ring of the instrument is placed in the groove between the second phalanx and the ungual crest the blade is positioned just in front of the footpad the blade is pushed through the soft tissues over the flexor process with the ring of the nail trimmer in position behind the ungual crest the blade is released just slightly so that traction applied to the claw causes the flexor process to slip out and above the blade at this point the flexor tendon can be incised and disarticulation of the joint disjointing completed both techniques effectively remove the entire third phalanx
3635983 declawing is actually an amputation of the last joint of your cats
3635984 general anesthesia is used for this surgery which always has a certain degree of risk of disability or death associated with it because declawing provides no medical benefits to cats even slight risk can be considered unacceptable in addition the recovery from declawing can be painful and lengthy and may involve postoperative complications such as infections hemorrhage and nail regrowth the latter may subject the cat to additional surgery
3635985 fifty percent of the cats had one or more complications immediately after surgery 19 8 developed complications after release
3635986 owners should be aware of the high complication rate for both procedures
3635987 one hundred sixty three cats underwent onychectomy fifty percent of the cats had one or more complications immediately after surgery early postoperative complications included pain hemorrhage lameness swelling or non weight bearing follow up was available in 121 cats 19 8 developed complications after release late postoperative complications included infection regrowth p2 protrusion palmagrade stance and prolonged intermittent lameness
3635988 objective to compare short and long term complications after tenectomy of the deep digital flexor tendons or onychectomy animals 20 cats undergoing tenectomy and 18 cats undergoing onychectomy procedure cats undergoingtenectomy or onychectomy were monitored for a minimum of 5 months to enable comparison of type and frequency of complications type and frequency of complications did not differ between procedures clinical implications owners should be aware of the high complication rate for both procedures
3635989 among 218 cats relinquished to a shelter more 52 4 declawed cats than non declawed cats 29 1 were reported by owners to have inappropriate elimination problems
3635990 17 9 had an increase in biting habits or intensity
3635991 the consequences of declawing are often pathetic changes in behavior can occur a declawed cat frequently resorts to biting when confronted with even minor threats biting becomes an overcompensation for the insecurity of having no claws bungled surgery can result in the regrowth of deformed claws or in an infection leading to gangrene balance is affected by the inability to grasp with their claws chronic physical ailments such as cystitis or skin disorders can be manifestations of a declawed cats frustration and stress
3635992 the association of veterinarians for animal rights is opposed to cosmetic surgeries and to those performed to correct vices declawing generally is unacceptable because the suffering and disfigurement it causes is not offset by any benefits to the cat declawing is done strictly to provide convenience for people the association of veterinarians for animal rights avar some veterinarians have argued that some people would have their cats killed if declawing was not an option we should not however allow ourselves to taken emotional hostage like this if a person really would kill her or his cat in this case it is reasonable to question the suitability of that person as a feline guardian especially when there are millions of non declawed cats living in harmony with people
3635993 the operative removal of the claws as is sometimes practiced to protect furniture and curtains is an act of abuse and should be forbidden by law in all not just a few countries
3635994 cfas health committee proposed the following guidance statement on the declawing of cats after review of the canadian veterinary medical associations cvma position concerning declawing and after research of scientific articles and information from the cornell feline health center from joan millers files of cat fancy and animal shelter materials and by talking with veterinarians feline behavioral specialists the american veterinary medical association avma the president of the american college of behaviorists and the director of ethical studies at the san francisco spca at the october 1996 meeting the cfa board unanimously approved this guidance statement on the declawing of cats cfa perceives the declawing of cats onychectomy and the severing of digital tendons tendonectomy to be elective surgical procedures which are without benefit to the cat because of post operative discomfort or pain and potential future behavioral or physical effects cfa disapproves of declawing or tendonectomy surgery
3635995 a major concern that the avar has about declawing is the attitude that is evident in this situation the cat is treated as if he or she is an inanimate object who can be modified even to the point of surgical mutilation to suit a persons perception of what a cat should be it would seem more ethical and humane to accept that claws and scratching are inherent feline attributes and to adjust ones life accordingly if a cat is desired as a companion if this is unacceptable then perhaps a different companion would be in order
3635996 the inhumanity of the procedure is clearly demonstrated by the nature of cats recovery from anesthesia following the surgery unlike routine recoveries including recovery from neutering surgeries which are fairly peaceful declawing surgery results in cats bouncing off the walls of the recovery cage because of excruciating pain cats that are more stoic huddle in the corner of the recovery cage immobilized in a state of helplessness presumably by overwhelming pain declawing fits the dictionary definition of mutilation to a tee words such as deform disfigure disjoint and dismember all apply to this surgery partial digital amputation is so horrible that it has been employed for torture of prisoners of war and in veterinary medicine the clinical procedure serves as model of severe pain for testing the efficacy of analgesic drugs even though analgesic drugs can be used postoperatively they rarely are and their effects are incomplete and transient anyway so sooner or later the pain will emerge

3636206 the presidency thinks right now its better to focus on problem solving rather than trying to go into characterisation of the war who started what who reacted and the eu is united behind the idea
3636207 the presidency wants to preserve as much room for manoeuvre for future mediation as possible
3636208 the situation is still evolving its not black and white of course georgia made some mistakes russia made some mistakes but the idea now is to help mediation to see what we can do from a humanitarian point of view
3636209 the eu should say no to russias subjugation of georgia and push russia out this means tough language sanctions against russia and quick eu humanitarian intervention
3636210 the first lesson of this crisis is that the old policy of eu non engagement has encouraged both parties to escalate their actions

3636254 when i was an it support rep i used multiple ways of supporting my clients vnc rdp etc it was confusing and time intensive to keep up with all the logins and to support people through slow tools that were insecure bomgar is an awesome one stop tool that is super fast and easy to use for both the rep and the client and it solved my clients security issues
3636255 we see nothing but a bright future ahead with bomgar remote access software in place at our company the bomgar platform has enabled us to very easily take on the role of a virtual it department for many of our existing customers and we are able to leverage that service to other new prospects as well the productivity and efficiency gains that we have experienced with bomgar are paramount in todays fast paced help desk environment this puts us in an excellent position to continually expand our support service levels and offerings
3636256 my experiences with bomgar from hardware to software to sales to support has been outstanding it has dramatically simplified our remote access support protocol
3636257 our computer support contractor uses this remote access software and its truly revolutionary in the hands of the right practitioner i can be on the golf course on a saturday and let someone know that there is a problem they wont be in the office either but can often fix it from their own remote location within a matter of minutes all while not bringing our network security down

3636260 the terra cotta army bears silent witness to one mans colossal yet vain endeavors to conquer death the first emperor of china failed like all others who have tried he did not become a god nor did he conquer death the afterlife or the universe

3636267 its baffling to me theres no reason why we would not go to court
3636268 its rather silly to turn over physical evidence on an unsolved murder to a person who has no business conducting an investigation

3636272 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry
3636273 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
3636274 russia now flush with cash wants to rebuild its 19th century imperial sphere of influence in the former soviet union
3636275 it also wants to make an example out of georgia to other nato aspirants what the chinese call kill the chicken to take care of the monkey so the ukrainians will think russia would use force to prevent them from joining nato

3636280 theres a stereotype that students from east l a dont want to finish high school and it was a chance to show everyone that we do want to go to college

3636340 the previous site dealt mainly with international audience and was not structured to cater for the local community

3636346 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3636347 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

3636353 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3636354 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3636355 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3636356 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3636384 this is definitely a time when we can make a lot of improvement with the conditioning we are doing and the double days this is where you make more improvement because some may wilt under pressure other teams will come together under pressure and work harder thats what makes you a better team in the long run the goal is consistent improvement but we can get a leg up during two a days

3636464 los ajustes se har a sobre la mitad de las jubilaciones m nimas ahora de 690 pesos que representan el 76 por ciento de todos los jubilados y pensionados
3636465 esto va a ser tanto para la jubilaci n m nima y la m xima si no est claro se escribe claramente
3636466 los sucesivos aumentos otorgados por el poder ejecutivo han ido achatando la pir mide trabajadores pasivos que antes ten an ingresos mayores ahora cobran el haber m nimo habr a que desenganchar de la m nima a todo aquel jubilado que antes no cobraba el haber m nimo
3636467 obligando a los jubilados a resignar el 10 por ciento para financiar su propio aumento
3636468 si el haber m nimo se va a ajustar con el mismo ndice habr que hacer modificaciones en los art culos 2 4 y 8 del proyecto

3636570 they have great athletes when they go through more experiences like this youre going to see a rise
3636571 were playing at our home and the crowd was going wild
3636572 we were a little bit nervous weve had other international games but this was the olympics
3636573 its been a lot of buildup five years of buildup to this one day im proud of my team
3636574 i dedicate this to the people closest to me and to alberto
3636575 we have a great relationship hes not just a coach hes someone you can talk to hes like a second father to me
3636576 i told him he doesnt need to worry to trust me and in the end it turned out ok
3636577 it definitely helps to be in a relationship it provides serenity and allows you time to get away from it all once in a while
3636578 the 400 final was only a tactical problem my form was there and i showed that today
3636579 thats my best asset knowing how to bounce back right away
3636580 sometimes they can break very easily and in order to avoid problems and show myself naked i put on another suit
3636581 if anyone thinks im upset with the silver this is a huge achievement for me
3636582 theres lot of pressure on us especially because of our history of being on top its hard when theres a tradition of gold behind you
3636583 its my best time so im happy about that but obviously its frustrating that im not going to be in the final
3636584 im not going to let it weigh me down too much because ive got a much bigger battle to take care of in about two weeks
3636585 i am so happy i came here and did this its been an amazing experience its everything i hoped it would be now ive got to take care of my life
3636586 eric has a better understanding of what i have been through in the last year
3636587 i need to talk to you about a health issue
3636588 i told him you can look at it one of two ways
3636589 now ive got a much bigger battle and i know im going to win that one
3636590 i dont sit there in my office and dream hes going to go 7 0 or 6 0 whatever hes just been almost unhittable or unscorable since hes been here
3636591 the starters success will let you play a long time
3636592 keep playing well now and then get an opportunity to play into the late fall
3636593 the overall economic outlook for the group remainsuncertain due primarily to the unpredictability of feedcommodity prices and demand for fuels in the light of recentrecord oil prices
3636594 we are still very cash rich indeed and are starting tolook for opportunities to invest
3636595 so far there hasnt been much of a change in our asset basebut you can see us taking a more active view of investmentopportunities as we move into the third and fourth quarter ofthis year
3636596 frankly i didnt think investors would react to the gdpdata this much
3636597 but it probably made them reconfirm that the recession willcontinue throughout this year or even until the end of thisbusiness year the data could be used as an excuse to run awayfrom risk assets
3636598 development in all fields is often two steps forward and sometimes two steps back
3636599 we used to have a programme which we started some years ago where we would send in rowing in a box
3636600 we would have these containers and they can be made into a small boathouses with say six boats and oars in there and we send them out
3636601 then they can put them out at the side of a lake open them and then start rowing
3636602 i feel guilty sometimes when you want these people to train because they need peace food and security and then i ask them to go rowing and they do it and they love it but still i feel like an idiot
3636603 even to participate in the olympics is a great progress for any country and it gives them local exposure
3636604 they get publicity and the sport is recognised even if the results are poor they are coming back as heroes
3636605 and we are happy for all the small steps we can take it will come but probably not in my time and that doesnt mean i want to die tomorrow
3636606 they have great athletes when they go through more experiences like this youre going to see a rise
3636607 were playing at our home and the crowd was going wild
3636608 we were a little bit nervous weve had other international games but this was the olympics

3636617 if anyone thinks im upset with the silver this is a huge achievement for me
3636618 someone told me at the top that i had the best time but i really couldnt celebrate until the last person crossed the finish line
3636619 if youre less aerodynamic but more comfortable and you can go faster then its worth it
3636620 i knew when i came here in december when it was freezing and snowing that it was a hard climb
3636621 i knew when i was four seconds down from emma that i had to turn it on in a big way i knew they would both be strong on the downhill
3636622 i heard on my radio earpiece that i was behind emma
3636623 i knew she was a strong rider but i wasnt too worried i knew the best part for me was still to come
3636624 this course was uphill so it didnt really suit me
3636625 you have to change a lot of gears and change the rhythm a lot so its really demanding
3636626 theres lot of pressure on us especially because of our history of being on top its hard when theres a tradition of gold behind you
3636627 the international baseball federation has confirmed the test it was done outside the olympic period starting on july 27
3636628 we learned about the news yesterday afternoon and it is very regrettable
3636629 i have already notified all the players on our team and told them that since now we only have 23 players we should give even better performance during the games
3636630 i feel today they did their job and did a good job
3636631 the medications are not illegal but theyre banned for olympics athletes
3636632 im not clear on what happened im not a doctor
3636633 we expect to also be able to set ourselves apart from thenegative development of the sector as a whole during the secondhalf of the year
3636634 despite the gloomy economic outlook we will continue tofocus on cross media integration to profit from acceleratedinternationalisation and to achieve our goals for the year as awhole
3636635 what is the most important thing for me to focus on at the moment
3636636 what would enable me to use my time more effectively
3636637 what is the next step for me in this moment
3636638 what do i want my life to look like in five years
3636639 in den letzten tagen wurde viel dar ber spekuliert in welchem ausma russland auch f r computer und internet angriffe gegen georgien verantwortlich zu machen ist

3636642 is disappointing but our remediation plan as approved by our joint venture partners recognized the risk and included specific actions to be taken at various levels of inflow
3636643 it is appalling and it reflects the underlying prejudice and a discriminating attitude towards travellers
3636644 this decision is being taken on the assumption that travellers will misbehave or wreck the place its appalling in this day and age and it sends a very bad message to a wider society youd imagine it would be a business opportunity and it makes the decision all the more bizarre
3636645 the front of borris house which has been beautifully landscaped with trees has been fenced off
3636646 people do like the one day fair if the traders take all their unsold goods and litter and use the skips provided
3636647 its when traders and travellers come in three days before the fair that it puts huge pressure on the village
3636648 everybody loves walking up and down the town for the fair but what we dont want are the headlines the next day we hope borris wont be left in a poor state
3636649 shouldnt be allowed to go ahead it just messes up the whole place
3636650 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
3636651 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
3636652 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
3636653 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
3636654 that the conflicts we have with our siblings when were children inevitably blow up again when were adults dont all brothers and sisters end up at some level hating each other
3636655 but the main thrust isnt new at all the main point is that there are very few absolutes in parenting parents need to know how children develop and how different parenting choices are likely to affect that development but in the end its the parents who have to make the choices baby and child care has never been about telling parents what to do

3636696 opposition leader dr kizza besigye has another problem you did not bring out he is a westerner from the same region as president yoweri museveni many people especially from the north and east would not want to see another person from the west sitting in state house soon after another westerner during the 2006 elections there were people who voted for museveni because voting for besigye would not have made any difference to the status quo
3636697 besigye is the only opposition leader who can make any credible challenge to museveni and he is able to do this for two reasons first he is naturally a brave man as well as cerebral secondly he is from the same region as museveni a non westerner challenger of besigyes standing would not have lived to see another day

3636731 i told her it was my right leg and she said ok were going to drop you down gently and you need to touch it with your left leg and i said ok thank you very much
3636732 she said you deserve it you hit it over the fence and we all kind of just laughed
3636733 i said i wonder what this must look like to other people
3636734 we didnt know that she was a senior or that this was her first home run
3636735 that makes the story more touching than it was we just wanted to help her
3636736 i really didnt say too much i was trying to breathe
3636737 i didnt realize what was going on until i had time to sit down and let the pain relax a little bit
3636738 then i realized the extent of what i actually did
3636739 i hope i would do the same for her in the same situation
3636740 she was going to kill me if we sub and take the home run away but at the same time i was concerned for her i didnt know what to do

3636759 and if you come on down everywhere you look its asians
3636760 here in america people think of it as this backyard sport where people are just dinking it around but they forget that when played professionally its the fastest of all racket sports
3636761 at top speed the shuttlecock is traveling at 200 miles per hour and its also the no 2 most played competitive sport in the world next to soccer admittedly thats because its so tremendously popular in china a billion person country really does a lot to bring up the par
3636762 ping pong is as influential in china as the nba is in america
3636763 everybody had a ping pong table growing up but us asian kids were expected to actually be good at it
3636764 i remember ours was in the garage and we had a long downward sloping driveway and i feel like i spent half our summers chasing balls down that driveway it was a rite of passage
3636765 ping pong doesnt require major muscular development but rather speed and fine tuned skills
3636766 it demands a more delicate kind of mastery than large field sports or body contact sports
3636767 in taiwanese circles in the greater new york area people still remember me as the girl who used to compete on the mens side at church tournaments
3636768 i have a second cousin whos a nationally ranked ping pong player in china myself
3636769 the games are just that much a part of us i guess theyre in our blood

3636771 we are extending full support to the agitation but our protest is symbolic as we are concentrating on the forthcoming polls for the urbal local bodies
3636772 im proud of whatever he has achieved and i want him to grab another olympic medal to add to his atlanta games bronze
3636773 like a good teacher would always want his student to achieve more than what he or she has achieved i too want him to do that im both his teacher and father im proud of his achievement but more than that im more proud because he is such an amazingly joyful boy
3636774 the only time i dont like it is when im introduced as leanders father
3636775 when he started we decided that he has to better leslie claudius four olympic appearances though he went on to do that i then realised someone has played in more
3636776 his bronze in atlanta was a huge surprise for all now he is in his fifth olympic and still hungry for a medal
3636777 after south korea won a gold in the mens doubles in athens badminton has become very important in korea
3636778 we will go for the gold medal but we want to focus on the semifinal first
3636779 we were playing well as a team today showing good unity and encouraging each other
3636780 a large number of vhp activists participated in the agitation at various places
3636781 if the ligaments are damaged then it could take several months to heal
3636782 its everything i ever dreamed about on the podium i kept thinking back at it im almost at a loss for words
3636783 im just really pumped about the relay we talked about breaking seven minutes and we did it
3636784 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3636785 going into the 150m turn and the finish i couldnt see the wall they were getting more and more full of water throughout the race i was kind of upset it happened and then thats why i ripped those goggles off pretty quickly at the end
3636786 it fall in crude prices is a happy sign it is a welcome development but there is no scope for reduction in domestic retail prices
3636787 there still are huge under recoveries on fuel sales i dont see how we can reduce retail prices when our companies continue to lose money

3636849 researchers who have read the paper that dowd and sotirov wrote on the techniques say their work is a major breakthrough and there is little that microsoft can do to address the problems

3636910 a tax cut war is spreading across europe as leaders of the continents biggest economies give up criticizing smaller neighbors for slashing business rates and decide to join them instead
3636911 a survey by kpmg found that the average corporate tax rate in a sample of 86 countries had fallen from 38 to 27 percent from 1992 to 2006
3636912 rate reductions have been particularly common in europe a may 2006 european union eu report found that 22 of the 25 eu countries had reduced their statutory rates between 1995 and 2004 the unweighted average of the countries tax rates had fallen from 35 to 26 percent when weighted by country size the average rate had fallen from 43 to 33 percent

3636916 the board of directors has a fiduciary duty to shareholders
3636917 if environmentally responsible investments eri i e voluntary capital expenditure decisions aimed at reducing the pollution of the firm and in particular investments related to climate change conflict with this fiduciary duty
3636918 estimate the cumulative abnormal stock returns car for a sample of firms announcing their voluntary participation in one of two programs that involve commitments to environmental standards the epa climate leaders cl and ceres contrary to earlier results related to compliance we find that firms becoming members in climate leaders experience a significant drop in their stock price on average 0 9 percent moreover when firms as part of the cl program subsequently announce a specific goal for the reduction of their greenhouse gas emissions their stock price declines further 1 3 percent on average
3636919 have insignificant announcement cars possibly because this program implies less stringent environmental performance goals compared to the climate leaders program
3636920 the share of national income going to employees is at approximately the same level now as it was in 1970
3636921 two principal measurement mistakes have led some analysts to conclude that the rise in labor income has not kept up with the growth in productivity
3636922 the first of these is a focus on wages rather than total compensation because of the rise in fringe benefits and other non cash payments wages have not risen as rapidly as total compensation it is important therefore to compare the productivity rise with the increase of total compensation rather than with the increase of the narrower measure of just wages and salaries
3636923 real compensation per hour rose at 1 7 percent per year when nominal compensation is deflated using the same non farm business sector output price index in the more recent period between 2000 and 2007 productivity rose much more rapidly 2 9 percent a year and compensation per hour rose nearly as fast 2 5 percent a year
3636924 the tax would cost shareholders of oil company stocks an average of between 21 3 billion per year and 121 9 billion per year in foregone increases in the value of their stock and foregone dividend pay outs these foregone gains would represent between 2 7 percent and 10 9 percent of the total projected value of oil company stocks in 2010
3636925 since 41 percent of oil company stocks are currently held in various forms of pension plans and retirement accounts retirees and those currently saving for retirement would bear much of the burden of those foregone gains the foregone gains for all pension plans and retirement accounts would total between 8 7 billion a year and 50 billion a year depending on the price of oil and inflation rate

3636928 a large number of people owe their lives to the thousands of coast guard rescues and the resources that private sector firms such as wal mart made available
3636929 decentralized organizational culture and relative political independence enabled the coast guard to grant a large degree of discretion to on the spot actors who could take advantage of their access to local knowledge these same benefits of decentralization explain the success of private sector firms
3636930 between august 29 when katrina made landfall and september 16
3636931 wal mart shipped almost 2 500 truckloads of merchandise to the affected areas and had drivers and trucks in place to ship relief supplies to community members and organizations wishing to help home depot provided more than 800 truckloads worth of supplies to the hard hit areas and also used buses to transport 1 000 employees from other areas into the region wal mart also provided a large amount of free merchandise including prescription drugs to those in the worst hit areas of the gulf coast most importantly wal mart and home depot were able to get this assistance to the disaster areas almost immediately after the storm had passed in comparison to the days in some cases weeks that residents waited for government agencies to provide relief
3636932 the only lifeline in kenner was the wal mart stores we didnt have looting on a mass scale because wal mart showed up with food and water so our people could survive
3636933 if the lesson of katrina is that the private sector is better at marshalling resources and delivering them quickly then disaster relief policy should remove the barriers that hinder the private sector from getting the job done
3636934 making hurricane response more effective lessons from the private sector and the coast guard during hurricane katrina
3636935 a dramatic decline in new claims for unemployment benefits since the 1970s and early 1980s new claims average 0 24 percent of employment per week from january 2004 to november 2007 slightly below the 0 26 percent average from january 1996 to december 1999 and well below any earlier period covered by the data
3636936 a variety of indicators based on household surveys establishment surveys and administrative records show a long term decline in the risk of job loss facing american workers
3636937 many observers interpret declines in the durability of employment relationships e g declines in median job tenure as evidence of an increased risk of unwelcome job loss and a decline in job security this interpretation is unwarranted job tenure statistics do not inform us about job security or the risk of job loss for the simple reason that most employment relationships do not end with an employer initiated separation
3636938 layoffs and discharges for cause account for only 36 percent of worker employer separations in the 2001 to 2006 period
3636939 scientific authorities have repeatedly asserted there is not yet any credible evidence of new risks to human health or the environment from any of the gm foods or crops approved by regulators and placed on the market so far
3636940 roughly 70 percent of all supermarket products in the united states have at least some gm content
3636941 approximately 25 percent of all new drugs approved for the market in rich countries
3636942 by 2006 farmers in the united states were using gm varieties on 89 percent of their acreage planted to soybeans on 83 percent of their acreage planted to cotton and on 61 percent of their acreage planted to corn
3636943 no peer reviewed scientific article has yet appeared which reports adverse effects on human health as a consequence of eating gm food
3636944 who is not aware of scientifically documented cases in which the consumption of these foods has negative human health effects these foods may therefore be eaten
3636945 all the criticisms against gmos can be set aside based for the most part on strictly scientific criteria
3636946 to date no verifiable untoward toxic or nutritionally deleterious effects resulting from the consumption of foods derived from genetically modified foods have been discovered anywhere in the world
3636947 the data available so far provide no scientific evidence that the cultivation of the presently commercialized gm crops has caused environmental harm
3636948 starved for science how biotechnology is being kept out of africa
3636949 states counties and municipalities that have individually passed bans at different points in time the vast majority of which were implemented over the past six years this presents a natural laboratory to demonstrate the effects of smoking bans
3636950 our estimates reveal a significant increase in the danger posed by drunk drivers following the passage of bans
3636951 specifically our preferred estimate indicates that fatal accidents involving a drunk driver increase by about 13 percent this is approximately 2 5 fatal accidents a year for a typical county
3636952 these estimates are robust to the inclusion of controls for area and time fixed effects changes in population changes in other policies that may impact drunk driving behavior e g beer taxes blood alcohol content regulation as well as changes in factors that may influence overall driving risk separate from drinking behavior e g construction weather etc
3636953 our evidence is consistent with two mechanisms smokers searching for alternative locations to drink within a locality and smokers driving to nearby jurisdictions that allow smoking in bars
3636954 from a policy perspective i dont really have a stance
3636955 i would stress that any increase in drunk driving estimated in the paper will eventually have to be weighed against the potential positive health impacts of smoking bans my instincts tell me that after all of the pros and cons are weighed the net effect of smoking bans will be positive in the long run moreover much of the concern about drunk driving raised in our paper could be alleviated if smoke free communities increase dui enforcement measures to provide drivers with appropriate disincentives

3636958 the common denominator is that we absolutely have no idea where we stand and why we are going into special session

3636985 today with the affirmative vote of both chambers of the alaska state legislature we now begin a lifelong partnership with a company that has shown its true commitment to alaskas future
3636986 the legislatures decision represents a significant milestone in advancing this major natural gas pipeline project to connect stranded u s natural gas reserves to alaskan and lower 48 consumers
3636987 this ratification of our license under agia will facilitate transcanadas continuing commercial negotiations with potential shippers improving the likelihood of a successful open season and the construction of a natural gas delivery system from prudhoe bay to lower 48 markets
3636988 when the producers would come in theyd talk about how big the project was how difficult it was going to be how hard it was to get the financing and all the reasons why it was going to be so so hard to get this pipeline built
3636989 i never heard any enthusiasm from them but when we heard from transcanada what we heard was this project is integral to their future this project is integral to alaskas future

3637009 its driven by gdp growth and the food drivers we have talked about for a very long time its accelerating and it is not going away
3637010 these new announcements of additional work really are going to piggy back on what we are already doing
3637011 we are just going to have a little more scale
3637012 csa has received initial support from several stakeholders including the canadian construction association
3637013 we are currently working to find additional stakeholders to establish resources to begin full development of the proposed standard
3637014 the standard would potentially be designed for contractors but could benefit others such as architects owners and specification writers
3637015 although the publication provided sustainable design principles for new projects the need for a national consensus based standard for deconstruction of existing buildings was identified
3637016 but im not sure we would actually lead the charge
3637017 contractors have a lot of other things to do these days
3637018 this positive feasibility study is a material step forward for the company in the restart of this past copper and precious metals producer
3637019 the production start at the end of 2010 meets our initial target and equipment deliveries have been arranged to match this schedule
3637020 the project basically involves the construction of a new five bay truck shop that will handle 240 ton trucks
3637021 there will be a primary crusher or a 60 inch gyratory crusher conveyor belts a storage facility for crushed rocks a concentrator fresh water and reclaimed water pipelines and a pumping station
3637022 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead

3637025 we did not achieve our ambitious target of moving across five million customers before the end of june
3637026 we will migrate five million by the end of september and well be moving from five to seven million by the end of the year
3637027 i cant give you a number off the top of my head because youll quote me on it and next year youll say sol you said thered be this many
3637028 that process is going to begin in the month of august and will be part of both tr1 and tr2 as we think about the systems the business side will continue into the next calendar year
3637029 some of us were brand new to the company and in october we did an inventory with people that had been here 20 to 30 years with telstra and we identified we had 1250 systems
3637030 as we got into it six nine twelve months later we found out we had 1 500 systems
3637031 theres a lot of complexity to this and the variability of plus or minus ten or twenty months that could be part of the story
3637032 theyre going to be close whether were off by five to ten to twenty here or there i dont know whether thats going to be the case
3637033 the second half of the year youll start seeing a bit of a diminution but itll be close to that figure

3637040 well then its absolutely necessary and dont even think of breaking the diet
3637041 yeah once a week or so only with my wife
3637042 as soon as you get out of here you are going to buy twin beds no more sex for you none
3637043 doc are you sure im going to live longer this way
3637044 i have no idea but whatever you live i assure you it is going to seem like an eternity

3637054 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3637055 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3637056 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3637057 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3637058 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3637059 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3637060 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3637061 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3637062 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3637063 the distance doesnt matter it is only the first step that is difficult
3637064 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3637065 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3637066 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3637067 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3637068 im very excited about this opportunity and im looking forward to the challenge of sustaining such a high performing public school

3637070 the forest service in an attempt to bolster an outgoing presidents environmental legacy rammed through an environmental agenda that itself violates the countrys well established environmental laws
3637071 it is not in any way overturned or compromised by judge brimmers decision in wyoming today
3637072 what it does do is create two conflicting court decisions in different federal courts different states both issuing decisions with nationwide impact
3637073 in light of the potential harm the roadless rule poses to our national forests due to beetle infestation and forest fires
3637074 we anticipate an appeal by either the united states or one or more of the interveners
3637075 this is a parting gift from the bush administration to its timber friends
3637076 it flies in the face of the science that says we need to protect more habitat not less
3637077 after almost 20 years of relying on a static regulatory approach which has led to continual inaction and further decline of the owl it is clear we should be using active management to improve the health of our forests and the spotted owl

3637087 hunting has been a part of the uae and gcc countries for generations skills and knowledge are passed down from father to son the skills learnt from hunting we want to keep that going
3637088 one of the greatest achievements of the exhibition is that we are able to promote the use of hybrid captive bred birds for falconry instead of endangered wild falcons and activate plans to maintain a balance between heritage and environmental protection
3637089 we are honoured to be able to pass our teachings onto the younger generation our future leaders in a fun and interactive environment this is important so that we maintain community confidence and adopt the best international practices to protect public safety and control crime in abu dhabi

3637117 he feels that ivan didnt tell the truth on the witness stand and basically denied having anything to do with the contract other than witnessing it
3637118 i dont think my nephew did any harm or hurt to the man physically
3637119 tell bates to give me my money back and we will be straight
3637120 its hard to pinpoint exactly what has gotten everybody so concerned
3637121 no one is alleging that the company did anything deliberate
3637122 but it hurts confidence to see an error that is of this magnitude
3637123 we look forward to the company providing answers to accounting questions at its august 28 2008 analyst meeting in baltimore
3637124 im scratching my head a little bit at the magnitude
3637125 especially given jareds deep pockets and his willingness to go so negative
3637126 he could have taken every voter in the 2nd congressional to the finest restaurant in the district and still had a lot of money left over
3637127 we all knew that this was an important congressional seat so it made sense that the race would be a competitive one
3637128 what we never counted on was that joan would run as negative a campaign as she did it left us no choice but to come back the tone was set by her
3637129 he made a conscious decision not to descend into negativity but to run a 100 percent positive campaign
3637130 i think there are a number of lessons to be learned in this report and there are things we ought to take a look at in this county

3637160 the sufa nahal oz and erez crossings were reopened this morning
3637161 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3637162 the referees have to be in unison but there was a lot of doubt about a lot of the shots out there
3637163 im glad it wasnt for a gold medal because that is all that this games would have been remembered for unfortunately
3637164 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it
3637165 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3637166 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3637167 the position i finished in is well above the position i am in the world
3637168 unfortunately the chinese shooter was in front of me so i had to wait every time after he shot before the noise died down
3637169 i am not using this as an excuse but i dont have much opportunity to practice in front of a crowd of 10 000
3637170 but i have learnt a lot today it proves you can teach an old dog new tricks
3637171 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3637172 from now on its just a downward slope the end is close i love it
3637173 we were not actually playing against the georgian team we were playing against our brazilian friends here
3637174 there is a text it has been accepted in moscow it was accepted here in georgia i have the agreement of all the protagonists
3637175 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3637176 it immediately became clear that in fact the confrontation was hardly finished
3637177 it is too early to reach unequivocal conclusions about whether the agreement reached by medvedev and sarkozy will really put an end to military actions in south ossetia
3637178 saakashvili is characterised by his unpredictability and a lack of willingness to respect agreements
3637179 those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3637180 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time

3637183 in uganda there are about 300 000 hiv aids patients who require arvs the 60 million tablets we make everyday is a good beginning
3637184 the government is the biggest client we also sell to several charity organisations which deal in hiv aids a dose costs 8 about sh12 800
3637185 officials from the world health organisation inspected our premises they said they were impressed but are yet to grant us their licence
3637186 for any tablet we sell we store a sample and use it to examine the drugs quality basing on the feedback we get from our clients
3637187 ive known erik olsen and joels company for years joel had been interested in the concept of the ferryman and the river styx he wanted to do something contemporary with it so thats what i was given from there i brought to the table people selling their soul to the devil eventually the devil is going to collect on that so the ferrymen carry the souls to hell
3637188 hes a cop who in the 70s lost his wife to a serial killer he winds up killing the serial killer in court and killing himself
3637189 in the morgue the devil says youre good at your job so if you work for me youll see your wife one more time
3637190 hes quitting the devil says hes got one more job for him and as they say hilarity ensues
3637191 their notes have been fantastic theyve suggested great things doing something like this with a quasi license can be nightmarish in the wrong hands and this has been one of the most easy gigs ive had a good editor helps you see the forest through the trees when youre a writer theres a lot of stuff in there that i think is in there because the idea is in my head but i dont realize i have to explain it sometimes
3637192 its been a great working with jon when i look at the pages im like oh my god this is awesome he just took my words and brought them to vivid life which im just thrilled with the book will sell because of the art it just draws you into this world
3637193 there are definite thoughts that this would be cool to live on in other media im writing it as a comic book story though they say dont write what you think is commercial right what you feel so im writing the story in the confines of a comic book with the pluses of a comic book that being said it could easily be translated into film but im not doing this to make it into a movie
3637194 abusing the right of freedom and democracy to violate the interests of the state
3637195 in this past week the prime minister seems to have stepped on the accelerator once again urging the ministry of public security to work on corruption cases and get quick results
3637196 when we first started to do this analysis we did it the same way they did but we worried and worried about selection bias that we might be missing
3637197 when new technology comes out people tend to use it cautiously at first they tend to use it in people in whom they are likely to get a good result
3637198 so what we think was happening was an important selection bias with a sicker patient population getting the bare metal stent instead of the des so all of a sudden the mortality for bare metal stent treated patients seems to go up the only explanation that i can come up with for that mortality pattern is that somehow the patients who were getting des must have been healthier or more likely to survive than patients who got a bare metal stent
3637199 i think it clearly shows that whatever risk des pose associated with late stent thrombosis by decreasing the risk of restenosis and the associated adverse events related to restenosis des have a net benefit we probably should be using them more but with the appropriate caveats that people need to be on long term antiplatelet therapy and we need to make sure we are identifying the patients who will be compliant and can afford it
3637200 you never see the magnitude of effect in the real world that you see in a randomized trial this is still a clinically meaningful difference
3637201 i think its very hard for some clinicians and certainly many patients to wrap their minds around competing risks and benefits
3637202 this study very clearly demonstrates that the benefit of des in terms of decreasing repeat revascularization and the associated morbidity and mortality clearly outweighs the risk of late stent thrombosis
3637203 that doesnt mean we shouldnt strive to create a new generation of des that endothelialize more reliably and it doesnt mean we should forget about the need for long term plavix therapy with des which will be an issue for some patients but i think this provides tremendous reassurance and solid evidence that on average des are effective
3637204 its not immediately clear why the malenka groups results were different other than they were comparing all patients who received stents from october 2002 to march 2003 with all patients who received stents from october to december 2003
3637205 the survival of these two groups was the essentially same so they concluded that des must not improve survival
3637206 i have some problems with this since it presumes that exactly the same kinds of patients were getting pci before and after des entered the market in fact we know based on the significant decline in cabg rates after des that numerous patients were getting pci after april 2003 who would have received cabg before des came along its possible that the october december 2003 cohort was sicker than the october 2002 march 2003 cohort in ways that malenka and colleagues could not observe and thus the beneficial effect of des in this cohort was blunted
3637207 trying to reproduce the malenka analysis and delve into these issues
3637208 gt 3 comments jun 4 2008 13 00 edt given the success of pci the transcatheter management of cardiac disease has expanded into new frontiers the area of valvular intervention has rapidly evolved in recent years dr philipp bonhoeffer a pioneer in the field discusses current and future developments in the percutaneous management of valvular disease drs hamm rothman and waksman discuss the state of des pci in the us and europe

3637210 it is known that stent thrombosis is associated with poor outcome
3637211 clinical consequences of stent thrombosis are generally catastrophic including short term mortality rates of up to 20 to 25 major myocardial infarction in 60 to 70 of cases and six month mortality rates among survivors of stent thrombosis of up to 20 to 25 however limited data are available on procedural characteristics during pci for stent thrombosis compared with pci for de novo stemi
3637212 since acute coronary syndromes and stemi have been associated with increased rates of stent thrombosis it would be recommendable when possible not to use des during primary pci and to use them when necessary during pci for acs only when glycoprotein gp iib iiia inhibitors can be administered and when there is no angiographic evidence of thrombosis
3637213 further studies are urgently required to improve stent selection according to the clinical and anatomic setting to optimize deployment techniques to better identify vulnerable stents and last but not least to elucidate the best antiplatelet regimen and its duration to prevent stent thrombosis
3637214 in patients suffering from this dreadful complication improved interventional strategies should be developed to ensure optimal results after these challenging procedures
3637215 should be congratulated on compiling a large series regarding an issue on all of our minds
3637216 of significant concern is the fact that stent thrombosis particularly early stent thrombosis is often due to mechanical factors that can be identified by ivus
3637217 the authors astutely recognize the potential utility of ivus to identify these issues and help prevent recurrent stent thrombosis but we would take it one step further and recommend routine ivus at the initial procedure to help prevent stent thrombosis altogether

3637221 despite study shortcomings the authors are to be commended for their efforts to provide initial data concerning the role of ct imaging in asymptomatic subjects they provided new insights into the prevalence extent and severity of coronary atherosclerosis before it has become clinically manifest but we agree with choi et al that we are far away from recommending ct screening in asymptomatic individuals
3637222 mass media and market forces have facilitated self referral within the general public
3637223 show that the strength of cta is the fact that this noninvasive technique can identify significant cad of the left main or three vessel disease known to carry worse prognosis which can be improved by revascularization
3637224 this does not necessarily apply to low risk symptomatic individuals
3637225 it is of note that no hard events death nonfatal mi occurred but more importantly the revascularization procedures were triggered by the fact that both physicians and patients were unblinded to the cta outcome data
3637226 other outcome data should follow with physicians and patients blinded to ct outcome to provide reliable data about the predictive value of ct coronary imaging with respect to hard outcomes
3637227 but before embracing ct coronary imaging as a routine screening procedure it needs to be shown that the potential benefits of screening outweigh the harmful effects of cta
3637228 the report by choi et al will hopefully be the first of a large number of studies regarding the establishment of the use of cta in asymptomatic individuals
3637229 we abide by the recommendation statement of the us preventive services task force against routine screening with resting electrocardiography exercise treadmill test and electron beam ct in adults at low risk which should also apply to cta screening

3637231 the triton investigators reported that with exclusion of patients with prior stroke transient ischemic attack and dose reduction in the elderly gt
3637232 a credible risk minimization or management strategy that reliably identifies patients at high risk of bleeding and mitigates this risk is key for regulatory approval and clinical practice i am not sure if this has been accomplished based on triton data alone additional pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies might be needed to clarify the benefit risk profile of prasugrel
3637233 if a large number of patients were excluded presumably due to increased bleeding risk then it has implications for benefit risk profile of prasugrel in real world clinical practice
3637234 daiichi sankyo and lilly remain confident in both the prasugrel study results and the overall submission package and will continue working with the fda and other regulatory agencies to bring prasugrel to market for the benefit of patients with acute coronary syndromes managed with pci

3637247 my parents had a pineapple farm when i was younger and that was what inspired me to venture into the pineapple business
3637248 we are from batu pahat which is a popular place to cultivate pineapples so the business is close to our hearts
3637249 maybe because my booth is placed far from the main exhibition area so the visitors dont really get to see it
3637250 the josaphine pineapple is special because it is a crossbreed between the johor and sarawak pineapple
3637251 we also ferry the pineapples to the selayang market but during this exhibition period it will be available for sale here
3637252 these guys were totally out of control they were worse than any thugs that ive seen
3637253 it was like back in the civil rights movement in the 1960s when martin luther king jr was marching women and children were maced and beaten kids are crying and these cops were laughing
3637254 they get the guns off the street they get the drugs off the street they are out there aggressively fighting crime and youre going to have complaints police officers have a right to use force youre dealing with people who dont want to be arrested
3637255 some of the allegations seem very serious and we want to take a thorough look at the matter and determined what went on
3637256 every time he heard a police siren he just screamed and screamed and screamed and said wheres my dad
3637257 hes on third base but so far he cant seem to find a way to get home
3637258 look at the underlying trends the economy is a huge issue bushs ratings are terrible but too many voters are concerned about obamas experience and dont yet have enough confidence in his ability to lead
3637259 no ones figured out how race affects this election but you cannot rule out race as a problem for some voters
3637260 obamas hurdles with voters are questions about his experience some policy differences and the feeling among some that he may be too liberal
3637261 the story of this fall campaign will be whether voters can get comfortable enough with him to trust him to lead the nation it really is about barack obama
3637262 their window was open up there and i heard a lot of cussing

3637268 the money is being spent to improve the overall operations of the school and for the future of the school and it is being spent appropriately
3637269 ultimately we would like to see and im sure renaissance would like to see that money go into their program
3637270 but if theyre shut down they wont have a program for it to go into
3637271 this is costing people a lot of time money and heartache
3637272 its our responsibility to gather all the information thats available to us to determine whether our initial decision to not to renew should be sustained
3637273 thats really our responsibility im looking at this from our position as the school reform commission
3637274 when youre placed in a situation by the school district where you are under attack and your charter is not being renewed based on what we think is faulty data you have no choice but to defend the school
3637275 they need to defend themselves against some of the accusations that have been made
3637276 if you look at some of the studies renaissances academics are as good if not better than some charter schools that were renewed without question
3637277 the renaissance charter is not looking for this whole issue to go away
3637278 they understand they need corrective action and they are taking steps towards that

3637317 there was very much a break away from the morning after girls early last year aimee and i decided to just get in and start recording the circumstance put us there and we made the decision to immediately head into something else rather than sit there and wonder what to do it definitely was a great catalyst
3637318 after our time in tmag wed really played enough shows we werent being particularly creative and i really missed that i was very happy to spend even if it took a year to sit in the studio and play when the right opportunities presented themselves we never wanted to go okay lets play the circuit and get our name out there that was never the plan
3637319 i think the intimacy comes from us being able to translate it directly to a recorded form almost as soon as we write it
3637320 often well come up with an idea hit record and go straight away and write as were recording also the lack of hand changing in terms of getting another four or five people to come and add their parts then getting someone to produce and someone else to engineer ensures that intimacy is there were able to control it and it very much is our sound that weve created right from the start plus having the studio at home were never on the clock
3637321 the basis of the recording and writing is aimee and i
3637322 for the most part its not an organised event to have others play on the recording with us
3637323 usually when we have guests staying with us at the house where were listening to music sometimes the mood takes us we never really set forth hey why dont you come over and do the guitars on the songs though we still like to make sure the basis of the song is still us playing
3637324 we have guests come in and they tend to add things that we havent thought of aimee and i are kind of generalists in a way we do what we do on a couple of instruments and by no means are we masters of any thats why its great to have people come in who havent heard the song a hundred times before or have a different playing style they can bring something a little different to the track
3637325 we had ricky maymi from the brian jonestown massacre staying with us earlier in the year and he knows graham from way back he played on one of the early bjm albums graham was in the country we asked him to come and stay at the house and he jumped on for the ride of course youd be an absolute idiot not to take the opportunity to go and record some drums when someone like graham is around
3637326 we were lucky enough to get a couple of drum tracks out of graham im starting to work through them now and its real nice to have those drums on there
3637327 itd be great if we could tour and have friends in other bands who play overseas to come and play tours with us when we tour through its a nice sense of community and creativity playing with different people on different tours at other times theyve got their own band and theyre off doing their own thing but it creates a little window to come in and out of if they feel like they want to do that
3637328 nice and scary to have a show like that as your first
3637329 weve just been really lucky that theres been other bands that are aware of us and like us whove reached out and asked us to play with them
3637330 well theres certainly not going to be any kind of getting to know you stage rickys already here and staying with us and we know the other guys well so itll be a way to catch up and get to see them play because theyre obviously an awesome live band
3637331 well i do think that our music is very visual its because of the light and shade and the different elements it carries the same mood all the way through and feels like a long road trip it has in many ways been a trip for aimee and i in both developing our writing and playing skills and our ability to do a whole bunch of things like recording mixing producing
3637332 theres a constant sense of evolution when you continue to write songs and the scope of your sound keeps expanding i think that opens you up for different ways to be creative

3637343 nico sailed really well on the first two legs on the first i was close to him when he managed to get away i was tired and he still had the willpower and clear mindedness to try anything to go and search and grab the opportunities this does not come down to good luck this comes down to pure talent
3637344 i believe in myself and my strategy and not necessarily just intuition i try and see the long term situation when it works out it is a bit like a spiral and that is were i do well i am also confident in my ability which has just grown over the years
3637345 even though i came to win i still feel i have had a great solitaire
3637346 it all came down to the first leg when nicolas troussel pretty much killed the race he has sailed brilliantly i have finished 3rd so many times so finishing 2nd it great now i have to come back next year to win it
3637347 it is funny nicolas troussel wins the first leg and overall gildas morvan wins the second leg and is second overall and i win the third leg and am third overall we have had to work hard but then what is really self assuring is that i have been very regular and finished on the podium on all the legs i think that i have become more of an all rounder and more consistent
3637348 i was expecting lots of things but then none of them where what i actually experienced you have to do this race to understand it i found out lots of things about myself about what drives me to want to win about what i am good at i tried to keep going the whole way the only little fright i had was on the second leg when i crossed paths with whale and we missed colliding by just a couple of centimetres on the third leg i went hell for leather it was a real sprint and even broke things on the boat i thought i was going to enjoy it and i just loved it
3637349 we have had two legs where low pressure systems have meant we could not sail the planned courses but then we just have to adapt
3637350 i am so happy now to see all the boats safely back and think that everyone is pleased now and when you see the level of these competitors you understand why this solitaire has such a high standard
3637351 it is no fluke that you see these very talented and experienced sailors on top of the podium i am also truly surprised by the rookies the first three are of extraordinary ability fran ois gabart adrien hardy and isabelle joschke but then they are good sailors who train hard and perform well all year long

3637386 our central problem is not finding good people its finding good ideas
3637387 we realized that if you take a good idea to a mediocre team theyll screw it up and if you take a mediocre idea and give it to a good team theyll either fix it or throw it out and do something else so the important thing was to find good people

3637391 naturally this helped me to maintain a laser like focus throughout the negotiations
3637392 if at any point i felt a peace deal was in jeopardy i simply pictured my wife soaping herself worked like a charm
3637393 it goes without saying there will also be many many hours of conventional intercourse with carla bruni did i mention that

3637395 through zaabiz we intend to provide the indian communities with a credible business networking platform that connects people and facilitates quick solutions to complex problems a unique platform zaabiz offers an innovative way to market and promote brands india has one of the highest numbers of networkers and almost half the members on the platform are indians zaabiz has entered the indian market because we see a great opportunity the challenge however is to bring out the true efficacies and benefits of our platform which can then be optimized to achieve greater benefits
3637396 networking today is an industry that has become a fiber of our being as far as accessing information is concerned businesses depend on networking to garner better efficacies and find the right fit business networking is fast catching up among serious networkers who are looking to leverage these platforms to seek and provide jobs to gain better access to solutions and solution providers and to gain an edge over competitors
3637397 our perception is that indians are the best networkers and the ones who use networks most efficiently

3637405 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3637406 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3637407 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3637408 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3637409 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3637410 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3637411 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race

3637414 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3637415 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future
3637416 i know a little bit about his character and everything is as advertised it is evidenced by the way his teams have played that he is very structured in the defensive zone
3637417 if you take a close look at what scott has done with young players at providence you dont have that kind of success without patience
3637418 i just felt he was the best fit for our organization just because youre in the nhl doesnt mean youre done developing scott has a track record of developing young players
3637419 we kind of had a pretty good idea we could break seven minutes
3637420 and it definitely feels good to be the first group first country to dip under the seven minute barrier
3637421 when i was on the awards ceremony for the 200 fly i started thinking about it and thats when i started tearing up to be at the top with so many great athletes who have walked in these olympic games is a pretty amazing feeling
3637422 i couldnt see anything for the last 100 my goggles were pretty much filling up with water
3637423 it kept getting worse and worse through the race to be honest i was having trouble seeing the walls
3637424 i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstance i guess its not too bad
3637425 we stand proudly for a womans right to choose consistent with roe v wade and regardless of her ability to pay at the same time we strongly support family planning and adoption incentives abortion should be safe legal and rare
3637426 the democratic party strongly supports access to affordable family planning services and comprehensive age appropriate sex education which help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies and thereby also reduce the need for abortions
3637427 when the actual language of the new proposal is read it still sounds stridently pro abortion
3637428 were going to be caught in that price squeeze again
3637429 we either have to increase yields or increase the price and we dont have power over either one of those things
3637430 you should be expecting to see higher prices in 2009 on the grocery shelves but the good news is it might not be as severe because the weather has been so good
3637431 i think they are telling investors that in the long term the days of 2 a bushel corn are behind us
3637432 if the harvest turns out to be what the usda predicted the government will have dodged a bullet
3637433 on the other hand grcs personnel will participate in different training courses that will strengthen national society response capacity
3637434 i will be very grateful if you take this patient under your care for further management and treatment because it not possible in the gambia
3637435 before we start doing major excavations we want to know exactly what is down there because we dont want to start digging it up and then suddenly find we are walloped with a far greater cost because we havent done our homework
3637436 we will be putting considerable weight in relation to putting seating around all the terraced areas that are there
3637437 they would all have to be stabilised seating put on possibly to the capacity of 4 500 people so we need to know exactly what is under there
3637438 with fuelly you can compare and compete with other users for mileage bragging rights does that matter it could help you research real world mileage on a car model youre thinking of buying and it might be something you want if youre a competitive hypermiler
3637439 overall the point of fuelly is to make saving fuel more fun by connecting your stats with your friends and at this early point in its life it does a pretty great job
3637440 im looking forward to seeing how fuelly helps me and my family reduce our fuel consumption
3637441 fuelly taps the power of the masses to compile real fuel efficiency data so that users can find ways to save money
3637442 infatti dovranno fotografare in modo originale e creativo un ricercatore e il suo ambiente di lavoro
3637443 at some point youre thinking about going for a field goal theres a lot to be said for playing the game and continuing to play because that had a chance to be a really frustrating night and in the end the musics playing and we won thats what we set out to do thats not exactly how we drew it up
3637444 i can say i never have been in a game like that
3637445 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in this ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought the game was over right there but one thing i can always say about my guys is they play nine innings and they certainly did that tonight
3637446 we were just hoping you could get somebody to come in there and put up some zeroes but it just didnt happen
3637447 there were a couple of times where i put pitches where i wanted to throw it and they put good swings on it theyre a good hitting team but nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning off you its pretty embarrassing actually
3637448 our pitchers tried to get it done but the other side has a good swinging team youve got to come up with your big hits
3637449 we needed that we need that type of game the way everybody relaxed loosened up weve got two more months to decide where were going to be at the end of the season thats the kind of game that puts you in the mood and gets you going right away
3637450 that was pretty tiring especially getting in so late in the morning
3637451 but it was a huge win for us to be up 10 runs twice and have them come back they can flat out swing the bats but it was a huge win for us
3637452 theres been some crazy games here in boston but usually its like a college type game with those runs scored
3637453 but it was definitely a good game for us to pull out in the end and huge for us to get that win
3637454 it certainly will be a memorable one for more reasons than one
3637455 it just means that youre old and doing this and somebody keeps being silly enough to give you a job
3637456 but ive never gotten caught up in stuff like this because i figured the time to do this is when im not doing this anymore and then you sort of look back and hopefully admire a lot of things
3637457 in new york joe mccarthy had a pretty good track record obviously
3637458 the thing that impressed me is when you start getting named in the same breath as casey stengel and ralph houk and mccarthy and miller huggins guys like that then it becomes something that gets your attention
3637459 not bad for a nation with no swimming pools and very little soap

3637461 this goes a long way to help those survivors in their recovery
3637462 they have begun the process of coming clean and transparent in a way they have never done before its now no longer about secrets its about protection
3637463 in the sense im responsible for this archdiocese i have to accept the blame
3637464 entrepreneurs are no longer limited to high dollar opportunities where the investment can take years to return now there are cost effective opportunities where entrepreneurs can jump out on their own without needing hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it times are changing
3637465 today prospective franchisees are awakening to a new reality no longer do they need to invest 300 000 plus in brick and mortar concepts to fulfill their dreams concepts like retrotax offer very real and viable opportunities to invest less with all of the upside potential that everyone dreams of
3637466 the judges had no reasons to hold her up but they were not allowed to start
3637467 they got a signal from somewhere that it was not time to start it was totally unusual that is all i can say
3637468 i was nervous and wanted to get the show on the road and i let my nerves get the best of me there was no sign with her name on the scoreboard signaling she could start her routine just a blank screen it felt like it took forever for my name to come up
3637469 the department received a number of proposals from several companies and appointed the companies that offered the most suitable offers and quality of services in order to streamline the procedures for all visitors and ensure a comfortable stay in the country
3637470 why did that man tell me always listen to your mamma
3637471 now she has some kind of time scale for blakes release it has given her some focus she wants something to impress him with because he has accused her of just sitting around doing nothing while he has been serving time
3637472 hes my first true love since rod and the age difference isnt an issue
3637473 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3637474 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3637475 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3637476 they have spoken on the phone since the split and are trying to remain on good terms but unless john has a dramatic change of heart its unlikely theyll rekindle their romance
3637477 velvet revolvers new album will draw heavily on their messy split with scott the band wanted a big name who could easily hold his own and reckon lenny is just the man for the job
3637478 this band is all about its fans and its music and scott weiland isnt 100 per cent committed to either among other things his increasingly erratic onstage behaviour and personal problems have forced us to move on
3637479 i think they did it issue an arrest warrant to pretty much scare us from coming back
3637480 i went and had a meeting with the foreign minister and he said i was welcome anytime very kind man very welcoming and he said i was his most welcome guest so theres a shocker
3637481 the culture is such that its one of the kindest most polite most welcoming cultures you can ever run across
3637482 there was a huge fight on july 18 at the romo home
3637483 we dont know if the victim is going to pursue the charges
3637484 the victim did have visible injuries and we also believe alcohol was involved that will be part of the investigation
3637485 alan and lesley told me it was all a big misunderstanding and that nothing actually happened in fact lesley wasnt even aware that alan had been arrested hayden found out about her dads arrest when he called her from jail they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion

3637495 abundant experience and our technologies enable us to integrate optimal solutions into customers business processes a striking example is the installation of x tones at vimpelcom the solution was launched in the network of the telecom holding company whose subscriber base exceeds 52 million subscribers
3637496 were giving our fleet based small and medium size customers the tools to keep their workforce more productive for longer
3637497 less time spent on admin means more time spent with customers coupling mobile forms with the 240 traffic alert and free 4mb data allowance means the net effect of mobile fleet is reduced travel increased productivity and improved customer satisfaction a positive result all round
3637498 for courier companies service engineers or companies with fleets of tradesmen mobile fleet is an easy to use easy to deploy solution which gives instant and obvious time saving benefits
3637499 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3637500 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3637501 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3637502 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3637503 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3637504 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3637505 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3637506 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3637507 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3637508 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3637509 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3637510 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3637511 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3637512 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3637513 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3637514 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3637515 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3637516 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3637517 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3637518 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3637519 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3637520 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3637521 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3637522 all documents views and metadata at all significant levels of granularity and composition should be available in the best formats practical from their own permanent hierarchical uris
3637523 mit der zulassung und dem beginn der klinischen studie mit mgn1703 haben wir bereits wesentliche ziele f r das gesch ftsjahr 2008 erreicht wir werden in den kommenden monaten unser entwicklungsprogramm weiter intensiv vorantreiben
3637524 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3637525 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3637526 over recent weeks the 90 day bank bill rate has fallen considerably this rates often used as an indicator of banks marginal cost of funds particularly at the short end
3637527 looking over the last two or three weeks the 90 day bill rates down around half a per cent so thats significantly reduced the banks marginal cost of short term funding
3637528 i think that means that theres no obvious reason that the banks could not pass through any change in the cash rate
3637529 with permission for the clinical study with mgn1703 and the beginning of the study itself we have already reached important goals for the 2008 fiscal year we will press forward with our development program intensively in the coming months
3637530 uspa executives were victims of the rampant road carnage in uganda and we believe through our campaigns more lives can be saved no accident has happened at that spot since then which proof that our campaign has been worthy

3637532 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3637533 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3637534 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3637535 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3637536 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3637537 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3637538 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3637539 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

3637541 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3637542 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3637543 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3637544 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3637545 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3637546 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3637547 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3637548 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3637549 it is uncommon for a healthy middle aged man to die from pneumonia
3637550 usually there is an underlying factor damage to the immune system of some sort
3637551 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3637552 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3637553 it was in remission but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
3637554 it is uncommon for a healthy middle aged man to die from pneumonia
3637555 usually there is an underlying factor damage to the immune system of some sort
3637556 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3637557 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3637558 it is uncommon for a healthy middle aged man to die from pneumonia
3637559 usually there is an underlying factor damage to the immune system of some sort
3637560 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3637561 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3637562 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3637563 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3637564 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3637565 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3637566 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3637567 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3637568 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3637569 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3637570 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3637571 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3637572 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3637573 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3637574 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3637575 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3637576 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3637577 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3637578 no seriously its a great zoo and i can get you in to see the kimodo dragon
3637579 i dont know whether we do it with a credit card number a drivers license or passport but i think making people responsible would raise the level of discourse
3637580 chris messina and will norris two leading community figures working on distributed social networking identity and data portability are joining the staff of openid provider vidoop the company will announce soon messina and norris have been working on a project called diso an umbrella group working to bring open source distributed social networking technologies to market they will continue the same work now as a part of vidoop the company provides user login functionality to both consumer and enterprise web publishers using an innovative system based on image recognition to replace passwords
3637581 one of the most interesting projects to me as of late has been diso diso is short for distributed social networking and is the work of several developers working out in the open developing real solutions for real users the mantra of the diso team has been one that i can relate to coming from the open source world lead with code this touches me right where my open source roots come from and i love it
3637582 if we really want to see openid adoption take off we should look less at throwing up a multiplicity of buttons to ease the flow and look more at how we can build the links between authentication brand and communications
3637583 scott has been one of the top up and coming coaches in hockey and with good reason
3637584 through his work in the minor leagues and most recently with providence over the last eight years he has gained an impeccable reputation the entire islanders organization looks forward to working with scott
3637585 garth has given me an unbelievable opportunity to coach in the nhl with the islanders
3637586 from my time coaching in providence ive seen firsthand the talented young players in this organization i look at the direction and the vision for this team and see a bright future

3637589 saya jadwalkan pengerjaan infrastruktur subway sudah dapat dimulai awal tahun 2009 atau pertengahan tahun 2009
3637590 pekerjaan tidak mudah sebab kereta api di luar kekuasaan pemerintah provinsi dki jakarta tapi nantinya kita akan terus melakukan koordinasi dan kerja sama dengan pt kereta api indonesia untuk pengadaan transportasi massal berbasis rel di jakarta
3637591 jadi cara perhitungan akan menjadi lebih efisien dalam penggunaan bahan bakar minyak dan juga mengurangi tingkat polusi di ibu kota yang semakin parah
3637592 tahu sendiri kan sekarang harga minyak tinggi di samping itu persediaannya juga semakin menipis dengan adanya subway masalah tersebut akan teratasi
3637593 it was just interesting to me that here we are you know trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place

3637596 i feel the education ministry should be more sensitive to matters like this where a whole community was insulted by a teacher who is a government servant
3637597 todays gas price decrease continues to see less of a decrease proportional to the drop in crude oil and nymex gasoline
3637598 the effect of a weakening canadian dollar accounts for some of this but the ability of toronto marketers to pad their wholesale margins have increased three cents per litre the past few weeks alone and the increase in retail margins by 1 5 cents explains the remainder
3637599 our customers will likely notice some of our sites will run out of gasoline temporarily gasoline is still being delivered but there will be for petro canada customers an inconvenience factor
3637600 the gasoline will be available at other petro canada sites it just might not be available where you normally fill up
3637601 thats kind of the finishing unit for gas at the plant its kind of like running a doughnut factory without a deep fryer we just cant produce product right now
3637602 people are somewhat brand loyal but people tend to look for the lower price so at this point another factor in their decision making may be well they have gas and they dont so theyll go there
3637603 wax coated cardboard boxes for example used for packaging fruit arent recyclable
3637604 we have a different kind of process for separating the sugarcane into its component parts so that the lignin is still useful
3637605 it can be put back into the pulping process to make recycled paper
3637606 we also get the advantage of replacing a wax material from a petroleum resource a finite resource with biomass a renewable resource
3637607 the chinese government is actively waging an olympics propaganda campaign to showcase tibet as legitimately theirs and tibetans as happy under chinese rule but the reality is much different
3637608 while tibetan song and dance is on display in beijing in tibet our culture is under siege and our people are being forcibly kept from speaking out about their repression at the hands of the chinese authorities
3637609 mon espoir est que cet accord aidera les victimes et leurs familles gu rir et aller de lavant

3637612 president mugabe and the leader of the opposition mdc have signed the agreement tsvangirai refused to do so at the last moment but this does not affect progress
3637613 the principals of the other two parties have agreed that they cannot wait any longer and the nation demands progress as such president mugabe will go ahead and form the next government and parliament will soon sit
3637614 president mbeki understands that the negotiations cannot be stalled any longer
3637615 president mbeki will brief angola as the chair of the organ on defence the negotiators found it unfortunate that tsvangirai pulled out at the eleventh hour but the talks are not over
3637616 after presenting it he could not even defend it and this led the parties to the negotiations to believe that he was not its author
3637617 the paper came as a surprise even to tsvangirais negotiators and everyone objected to its introduction as it sought to override the agreements that had already been reached by the three parties
3637618 it seemed that reason would prevail for the sake of progress but at the last minute tsvangirai declined to sign that is why you saw tendai biti saying afterwards that he was confident the negotiations would continue
3637619 the fear is that tsvangirai might take too long to sign the agreement in which case the other two parties will simply go ahead and form the next government
3637620 the talks have not collapsed we are on a time out and we are most likely to continue tomorrow today there are some sticking points still there
3637621 as long as we have tongues we will continue talking
3637622 let me check our schedule im sorry but im already booked that day or time maybe next time

3637631 i couldnt see anything for the last 100 my goggles were pretty much filling up with water
3637632 it kept getting worse and worse through the race to be honest i was having trouble seeing the walls
3637633 being at the top with so many great athletes who have walked in these olympic games is a pretty amazing feeling
3637634 i wanted to go 1 51 or better but for the circumstance i guess its not too bad
3637635 i would have liked to have medaled but i got my first personal best of the meet
3637636 your kingdom come your will be done on earth as in heaven
3637637 god im putting myself on record as wanting earth to be like heaven and as soon as im done praying im going to start making it so
3637638 love god with all our heart soul strength and mind and love our neighbor as yourself
3637639 if you are being led by the spirit you are not under the law
3637640 at the very beginning my parents didnt approve of weight lifting but my coach was very persistent he came to my house three times to persuade my parents that i was good weight lifting material i really appreciate him
3637641 i saw on the tv that he successfully lifted 187
3637642 he looked to lift it easily so when he was about to lift 197 i was worried i was really nervous
3637643 if i dont do what they say then i wont be able to sell here anymore
3637644 i got the ball about 40 yards out and took a touch and just went for it usually i wouldnt take an outside shot but the keeper was off her line and i just hit it good things happen when you take chances
3637645 i think its fantastic that we bounced back from the first 15 minutes against norway
3637646 you look at the first 15 minutes of that game to the last 15 minutes of this game and many things have happened the whole team and myself has gained confidence every minute weve been together
3637647 he hurt the thumb on his glove hand but to what extent i dont know but hes been playing with an injured finger ankle hes always going out there and giving it his all
3637648 the brain trust didnt agree so ill do it again tomorrow
3637649 i didnt want my season to end on the doctors table
3637650 its something sabes and i have talked about ill leave it at that
3637651 hes got to adjust a little better hes got to discipline himself a little better
3637652 its hard enough when youre facing major league pitchers when youre chasing pitches out of the zone it gives the pitchers a lot more options

3637656 the most important is the final tomorrow i knew that it was going to start fast i was concentrating on myself and at the end i was just ecstatic and now im elated
3637657 i hope that people werent too disappointed because really i was the most disappointed
3637658 but now i am satisfied that i swam the race just like i wanted
3637659 i would have liked to medal but i got my first personal best of the meet and i think thats a good effort
3637660 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next heat

3637663 without the extra track there is a real danger that the growth in new housing will far outstrip new jobs leading to a slowdown in the local economy more people commuting out of the area and the inevitable knock on effect of more congestion
3637664 the route suffers from regular delays and cancellations to passenger services as a result of the limitations of the infrastructure
3637665 at peak times it operates at full capacity but the infrastructure is unable to support an hourly timetable
3637666 the united states has experienced an anthrax attack and security experts repeatedly express concern that future attacks with biological weapons are likely if not inevitable
3637667 you take what you can get not many people with his abilities show up very often
3637668 there are 15 000 to 16 000 people now working in labs on select agents thats many more possibilities of another bizarre individual doing illicit work

3637670 ok i accept the fact that slaughtering my wife in front of my kids wasnt really right but to handcuff me for it to take me to court and send a tv crew dont you think youre overdoing it a little
3637671 catherine heeft nagenoeg nog niet gewonnen van dit meisje maar ons tactisch plan werkte dat plan was om haar lam te leggen en haar technieken zijn ook niet doorgekomen maar na 3 minuten in de golden score zijn beide meisjes dood en dan is het wachten tot er een valt jammer genoeg draait het niet in ons voordeel uit maar catherine heeft alles gegeven en het was misschien wel haar beste wedstrijd ooit tegen scapin
3637672 ik ben er klaar voor en heb zin om te beginnen
3637673 we hebben een goede stage in yantai achter de rug en ik ben blij dat ik het kunnen zeggen heb dat ik ermee stop op die manier is die druk al van mijn schouders en kan ik proberen echt te genieten van deze spelen ook met mijn achillespezen zit het goed al ben ik altijd bang om dat te zeggen want ze kunnen nogal eens wispelturig zijn soms spelen ze nog een klein beetje op maar het probleem is van de baan
3637674 op het wk vorig jaar in osaka was het ook heel warm ik vind dat het hier nog gaat ook met de zenuwen gaat het ik ben altijd nerveuzer in aanloop naar maar eens ik er ben en zie dat iedereen bezig is dan gaat het
3637675 onder meer de amerikanen en de jamaicanen hebben alweer heel snelle tijden neergezet maar van die tijden trek ik me niet te veel aan vaak worden die namelijk gelopen in superomstandigheden en ik krijg niet zo veel de kans om in zon omstandigheden te lopen hier is alles voor iedereen hetzelfde
3637676 in mn hoofd ben ik opnieuw klaar voor alle drie de afstanden ik moet natuurlijk afwachten hoe mijn lichaam reageert en we zullen het dag per dag bekijken maar ik zit in de beste vorm van het seizoen mijn doel is finales en als dat op twee afstanden lukt dan zal ik al heel tevreden zijn
3637677 its ridiculous how many times ive got to see your ugly face
3637678 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it it started sinking in a little bit after the butterfly its a pretty cool title
3637679 when my goggles filled i knew there was nothing i could do i just had to swim i tried to see something but i was more or less counting strokes i know i can go faster than that it does disappoint me

3637688 but once i got started and had my family and friends cheering for me i was good
3637689 i am here today because of my dad and my family
3637690 when i went to colorado springs i was around people who had one goal in mind to train and become the best they could be
3637691 it was a positive environment it changed my life around
3637692 definitely there is an advantage to being tall in singles
3637693 we were expecting and preparing for hard shots all the time and then they played soft shots
3637694 the whole purpose was to draw attention to badminton and that was good
3637695 they have a different approach to wine beer and spirits than other generations
3637696 in this generation there is an acceptability of wine as the alcohol of choice and they drink for drinkings sake for pleasure and conviviality less in concert with foods and eating
3637697 they are drinking wine completely different than the previous generation
3637698 they are fearless they are the imac generation they click and try something new if they dont like that they click and try something else
3637699 they just want to try something taste it and if its good post it to a friend they learn from their tribe not the so called wine critics
3637700 we have found that 21 percent of people who drink wine regularly are in that age group
3637701 beverages like coffee have become a vehicle where you can travel the world jamaica columbia brazil its an adventure
3637702 wine is something that has a living soul its about history land geography people its cross cultural when its in the bottle wine changes every day and when you pour it in the glass it will have a personality its so complex wine is always presenting you with a challenge
3637703 i dont feel any pressure to pick a date when it happens it happens
3637704 but at some point youve got to start narrowing it down you cant get three guys ready for your opening game
3637705 i say tavita but we are not talking about a huge difference
3637706 we feel like weve got three guys we believe we can win with and i know thats a luxury in college football these days
3637707 its helped him very much in terms of running the team all the little things like the new 40 second clock for example
3637708 its game experience he knows the speed of the game and that helps him
3637709 in the back of your mind you always know that football is a volatile game and i think its great that our team will have complete confidence that we have three quarterbacks who can play
3637710 get back to playing the way we did last year
3637711 we realized we still have a lot of work to do
3637712 they felt that its faster and they liked the tempo
3637713 its something we need to practice more it was good to see that we need to use it in our practices
3637714 i dont think lebron is going to get any sleep
3637715 theyve been talking about this game since training camp in las vegas im going to get some sleep but ill tell you what thats the game i got marked on my calendar its been circled on my calendar for two years since we left japan
3637716 we want to get them back we were really young and i think a lot of us have grown and matured since then and gotten stronger thats the great thing about competition you beat us and it comes right back around
3637717 the judges had no reasons to hold her up but they were not allowed to start
3637718 they got a signal from somewhere that it was not time to start it was totally unusual that is all i can say
3637719 i was nervous and wanted to get the show on the road and i let my nerves get the best of me there was no sign with her name on the scoreboard signaling she could start her routine just a blank screen it felt like it took forever for my name to come up
3637720 we win two games in the olympics we get a parade
3637721 and on the cutting edge you get criticized chinese sports leaders listened and they went along with his ideas we were allowed to be more innovative and creative
3637722 that all good things start at the bottom and work up dont be afraid to be innovative respect the christmas tree
3637723 i will return to sort out whatever needs sorting out now i am at the olympic games where i have to give everything to brazil
3637724 we will just have to wait and see what happens with betis because i have already been told that around 30 teams want me
3637725 these things are normal in football though so it will all be sorted out when i go back
3637726 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3637727 but im friends with becky she had a decision to make and she made it
3637728 i think that people with contract negotiation problems will go to europe and thats good
3637729 its a great experience it was great for me so it would be hard for me to criticize anyone doing that
3637730 heres a guy whos a good player averages 11 12 points in atlanta a playoff team he gets offered a lot more money per year than any nba team is offering so he goes to greece
3637731 he has enough money so he can take his family probably he plays maybe two games a week in a shorter season has the summers off i dont see why an nba guy if its more money and less playing im sure its attractive to them
3637732 just seeing how wine is a natural part of life not forced not pompous just very simple that was very appealing to me
3637733 i would like to see wine integrated into everybodys life it just makes the quality of life better i want people to see it as natural i think its the best complement to sociability which is something i love to do
3637734 its fun you get to taste a lot of wines thats why im here to satisfy my curiosity
3637735 people dont think twice about spending 80 on a kosta browne russian river or a sea smoke santa rita they buy an ungodly amount of pinot noir but not burgundy
3637736 wine has definitely caught on in a serious way with my generation hopefully it will continue to become more of an everyday occasion and lose a bit of the pretense
3637737 i couldnt get this education anywhere else if i cant find an answer to a question in a book i will ask darrell corti he will know
3637738 a lot of young people are making the switch from quantity to quality they are drinking more variety its not just cabernet and chardonnay they are drinking things they havent heard of before or hadnt tried
3637739 right now i am drinking a lot of greek wines which i think are some of the best in the world
3637740 this is the business i want to work in i have a passion for it i have a love for it this is a job where you can learn and experience something new every day i will be here at corti brothers for as long as darrell will have me
3637741 this is a hands on job from start to finish it has given me a whole new perspective on wine
3637742 there are a lot more young people drinking wine in napa at tastings i have met many winemakers sommeliers and wine professionals
3637743 the first thing i tried that got me pumped up was a barolo whoa a light went off in my head i finally understood the difference between good wine and great wine a wine that awakens all your senses
3637744 im only 23 but people tell me i have an old soul my idea of a fun night is cognac and a fine cigar i have been through a war now i have found something i love i love wine and i love people every day i want to surround myself with something i love wine has absolutely changed my life
3637745 pengadilan negeri jakarta selatan mengukuhkan dirinya menjadi kuburan bagi kebebasan pers
3637746 are a number of reasons to be skeptical of the report
3637747 initial tests conducted by internet evolution of deep packet inspection equipment indicated that the devices that were put forward for testing had difficulty identifying the protocol being used if simple encryption techniques were used
3637748 thats a far cry from being able to identify the contents with sufficient resolution to pick out the artist and label the system would also have to avoid red carding legitimate song purchases and noninfringing snippets of copyrighted works
3637749 so the roller coaster ride in bostons always fun luckily we got the cheers at the end
3637750 after that first inning when they had us down 10 0 i think everybody in the ballpark and everybody in all of massachusetts thought that the game was over
3637751 nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning its embarrassing
3637752 but we know our team is capable of fighting back
3637753 the history of behavior of these men including the current matter does not reflect the standard of excellence we aspire to on and off the mat
3637754 we have outstanding student athletes in our program and we will move forward in a positive manner toward our goals
3637755 i want to personally apologize for any embarrassment that may have been caused for our athletic department the university and our fans
3637756 ive got a little broken bone in there i dont even feel like i should even be out here practicing on it or even going into preseason
3637757 but its something that no one else seems to feel like its affecting everything so im out there practicing and playing the game
3637758 a lot of guys would hold themselves out of that period the goal line period with a cast on but he stepped right up
3637759 im employee no 23 so i do what im told
3637760 hes a warrior that makes me feel like if i have any knick knack injuries everybody has something bothering them
3637761 if hes pushing through it still catching interceptions with the half hand looking like the penguin then i can play through it
3637762 i wish we had more time the reality is i dont think were very good right now as a team
3637763 if we dont have our stuff right and our guys arent right well get run out of that stadium real quick
3637764 any coach is going to say that but i think were ready
3637765 i dont think a lot of guys are ready to do a lot of things in life but when they get thrown in the fire theyve to man up or b up
3637766 learning that my husband and i had diabetes was very nerve wracking i didnt know what to do next
3637767 most of the people that take the class knew they had diabetes but didnt know what to do about it
3637768 the health system in the united states focuses on diagnosis and treatment but if we educate people on prevention they can take charge of their health
3637769 although we didnt evaluate the quality of the information presented by the media 41 percent of people said they acted on that information changing their diet and exercising or seeking more information from their physician
3637770 japanese police have arrested a 20 year old man who attacked and robbed two people after they stared at his winnie the pooh costume officials said on tuesday
3637771 recently congress passed the american housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act also known as the housing bill its passage was lauded by many who are legitimately concerned about foreclosures and the housing market in our countrys economy i was asked how i could vote against a bill to help american homeowners but i found this bill to have more to do with helping big banks than helping average americans

3637789 go and check every one of the 10 500 athletes present
3637790 you dont wake up in the morning wondering how many ice buckets you need today you dont have as much pounding going on
3637791 if we win only one gold again in beijing i will jump off the highest building
3637792 you go to lanzhou capital of gansu province and the dolce and gabbana is d amp c you expect them to fall apart the very next day but because they look so good you still buy them and if you can get four pairs of fakes for what it would normally cost for one pair then its worth it
3637793 you have to go to about five places to get a deal you really like
3637794 you can be so aggressive in china shouting and pointing and saying this is a completely crap product but i still want it for a cheap price
3637795 and at the end after youve made a deal everyone is smiling
3637796 i keep them all alive still until i say differently im going to keep them all alive
3637797 we havent made any decision yet were embarking on a national debate but i certainly wouldnt envisage any family on 100 000 a year in joint income having to pay third level fees and in fact i would envisage the bar being set much higher than that
3637798 what i am saying quite clearly is that i would never bring within the band people who can ill afford to pay i would rather be looking at people who can afford to pay and there are many millionaires in this country who can afford to pay
3637799 there are so many millionaires in this country at the present time and the question is being asked of me on a regular basis by ordinary people why would they pay for their young kids going into private college at second level and then go off free into third level institutions
3637800 i dont think any ordinary person out there on the street would disagree with me that people who are extremely well off should be asked to pay a contribution i certainly wouldnt want people who are struggling already to keep their children in third level to be asked to pay fees
3637801 it is the policy of the party that we would not support the going back to that simple flat fee structure
3637802 that is not to say that we wouldnt be supporting a more innovative and creative approach to funding
3637803 the final abandonment by fianna f il of any pretence of a commitment to the principle of equal citizenship
3637804 it should be an elementary principle of any democratic republic that there is universal access to basic services like education
3637805 if mr okeeffe and his colleagues wants to ensure that the wealthy make a fair financial contribution to irish society then the way to do it is by broadening the tax base and closing off the tax shelters
3637806 i heard kurt suzuki yell home and thank god jason bartlett stopped if not there would have been a collision and i think i would have been the one on the floor
3637807 we need to turn the page and to come here and beat tampa bay is a step in the right direction we didnt rip the cover off the ball but we got what we needed and gio pitched great for us
3637808 obviously the more time im there ill be better and feel more comfortable its a reaction position
3637809 i heard kurt suzuki yell home and thank god jason bartlett stopped if not there would have been a collision and i think i would have been the one on the floor
3637810 we need to turn the page and to come here and beat tampa bay is a step in the right direction we didnt rip the cover off the ball but we got what we needed and gio pitched great for us
3637811 obviously the more time im there ill be better and feel more comfortable its a reaction position
3637812 i wish we were in the light a little bit i guess thats how it is
3637813 emotional roller coaster as well as a professional roller coaster
3637814 hes a little more relaxed and comfortable with what were doing the other guys will come along
3637815 were letting j t go at it here a little bit and well see how he does
3637816 little bit better command of the huddle and line of scrimmage
3637817 its up to the coaches and up to the quarterbacks to separate themselves
3637818 you want to say youre constantly getting better with it but unfortunately there are going to be days
3637819 the three of us arent sure at times whats going on
3637820 i try not to worry about that the more you do that the more its going to hurt you and your play
3637821 but im trying to keep a good attitude and wait for my chance again
3637822 ive never been in a training camp where this many receivers went down
3637823 but i think were doing a good job fighting through it
3637824 as much as its tough on them out here in the heat its extremely important for them going forward because they must be in great condition
3637825 aaron and i have always gotten along well when weve been around each other especially through the draft stuff
3637826 he was always good to me so ive always respected him for that
3637827 go and check every one of the 10 500 athletes present
3637828 you dont wake up in the morning wondering how many ice buckets you need today you dont have as much pounding going on

3637830 this is my third olympics one of the biggest privileges is wearing the stars and stripes now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it sounds weird to say it it started settling in after the butterfly
3637831 i kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3637832 ive been on this relay for the past four years
3637833 thats something we talked about getting under seven minutes to do it here is very special its a great feeling it was a goal
3637834 i knew there was nothing i could do i had two caps on i couldnt rip them off i just had to swim for the finish and the 150 wall i couldnt see i was more or less counting strokes i know how many strokes i take for a 50 i was disappointed i know i can go faster than that its disappointing to me that i did have a goggle malfunction
3637835 record labels have been screwing us for so long with high cd prices and albums with only one or two good songs those record exec fatcats with their expense accounts and private jets they deserve this im just sticking it to the man

3637840 without the extra track there is a real danger that the growth in new housing will far outstrip new jobs leading to a slowdown in the local economy more people commuting out of the area and the inevitable knock on effect of more congestion
3637841 the route suffers from regular delays and cancellations to passenger services as a result of the limitations of the infrastructure
3637842 at peak times it operates at full capacity but the infrastructure is unable to support an hourly timetable
3637843 i struggled for rhythm and the format did not allow me get into the groove in practice we shoot six arrows one by one but here i had to shoot one leave the lane for the opponent to fire one before i could go and have my second go at it
3637844 its not that i lost to someone who is a world beater but i think it simply was not my day i had high hopes since finishing second in the ranking round and this is surely not my best performance

3637851 all these players whove gone abroad its a loss of talent for the team but its also a source of pride for chinese people
3637852 were representing singapore and even though were chinese when we play we give it our all
3637853 anyhow were just not capable of posing a threat against china
3637854 this is just going to help us to make the next generation stronger to build up a very solid system domestically

3637856 after the rugby world cup last year you notice we didnt win
3637857 you may know who won and they won well the new zealand media wanted some blood and they havent had any blood so theyre still looking for it i guess
3637858 i have now had an assurance from the department of defence and the department of state that once the tender has been issued to one of the two bidders for our planes they will face track the process
3637859 ill only breathe a sigh of relief when i receive the cheque but so far the assurance given to me by the american government is very welcome
3637860 water is seeping in between the layers of the latex its pooling the so called maintenance is somebody going around after rain with a pin or sharp object piercing the latex covering so that the water drains out and thats it
3637861 its hard to absorb that information at first and then when you do you panic
3637862 what really surprised me is how thankful i was for what i do have
3637863 when i went to camp i saw a lot of kids with the same thing i had but they had amputations
3637864 i think this accentuated her character but it was there
3637865 we knew we would just have to fight it harder
3637866 im really looking forward to not being treated so special
3637867 g men and journalists top news stories of the fbis first century
3637868 since the advertisement states that the cabin is from fbi vault it is clear that the government is responsible for the public exhibition of the cabin this has obvious relevance to the victims objection to publicity connected with the unabom case
3637869 i think whats interesting is after all these years that ted kaczynski would be concerned about the exhibits impact on his victims
3637870 the congressman obviously has an interest in this he wants to see whats been done and whats left to do
3637871 students and teachers should never have to compromise their health and safety to attend school and this legislation will help prevent this from happening
3637872 where there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing we vigorously investigate it and where there is enough evidence to charge someone with a crime we vigorously prosecute
3637873 but not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3637874 the attorney general the nations top law enforcement officer seems intent on insulating this administration from accountability
3637875 the officials most directly implicated in the misconduct left the department to the accompaniment of substantial negative publicity
3637876 their misconduct has now been laid bare by the justice department for all to see
3637877 people are always getting older and in the next five years theres definitely going to be an increase in the need for mechanics
3637878 people used to come here and used to go out and work in the commercial industry

3637880 we wanted to establish a relation with a local amp technical college
3637881 you might have to relocate but theres job out there
3637882 the condo conversion market peaked in 2006 and it pretty much died quickly in the first quarter of 2007
3637883 part of it was that the valley experienced units converting at the same time and the demand just couldnt meet the exposure on top of that 2006 was a hot market for single family homes
3637884 it makes sense right now if someone is looking to build apartments to rent them out as apartments until the market comes back for condos what were seeing right now doesnt mean there wont be a market for condos in the future
3637885 that he was the driver and that everybody involved in the collision were his family members from agua prieta
3637886 if you take the view that the worst is over as far as the oil prices are concerned and therefore as a corollary inflation and interest rates would come down then the strategy to which it has to be that either you be equal weight or slightly underweight and in line with that i think infosys and some of the other top tier it companies one could go a bit underweight maybe look at selling off a little bit at these levels and win more in some of the rate sensitive which would benefit instantly once we see oil prices cooling off further and interest rates and inflation coming down
3637887 if one has a trading position then my sense is that even to book the loss at this point of time but if its an investment then maybe one could wait for about 2 3 months and then you should see a price of around rs 1800 and at that time it makes good sense to switch out of infosys and may be into some other midcap stocks in the infrastructure banking and financial services
3637888 sel manufacturing has got a final support of about rs 370 the person needs to either get out on a rally or if rs 370 breaks is certainly not looking strong and the kind of fall it has had does not potent too well for the stock in the coming future
3637889 if crude comes back cairn india will come back as well the next resistance here could be around rs 248 one should keep a stop loss of about rs 215 220 and try to ride it back up to rs 275 280 thats assuming crude starts moving up at some point or even if it has a small upward move one will see cairn moving sharply so its a good investment at a good price

3637909 it literally feels like youre a rocket coming off the wall the water completely runs off the suit
3637910 theres been a lot of talk in the swimming community trying to say this is getting out of hand the suits are having too much effect
3637911 as long as were not providing propulsion for the swimmers theyre still reliant on generating all that themselves

3637915 weve got two projects coming where theres a live action element but our view is not that were trying to diversify its more that weve got a creative vision to try something different and we want to support that vision
3637916 whether or not it goes beyond that we dont know but we dont want to turn pixar into a live action studio in fact the intent is that the special effects will not be done at pixar we are not trying to become a special effects company

3637918 the downturn in real estate values has severely affected the companys ability to pay investors
3637919 this is incredibly stressful for mr rangel his concern is for the investors in his various companies
3637920 mr fournier has done nothing but look out for the financial interests of all of his clients and expects to be fully vindicated in the upcoming finra arbitration hearing
3637921 both the timing of ms austins lawsuit and its filing in the los angeles superior court are highly suspect
3637922 any lawyer who commonly practices in this area of the law knows that ms austin is required to pursue her claims before a securities arbitration tribunal and cannot proceed in state or federal court
3637923 the court filing therefore suggests nothing more than a litigation tactic

3637935 we will try and play our natural game against him and see how it goes he does not bowl at 150 kmph so there is no reason to be frightened of him when murali was new to international cricket even he bothered many top batsmen and is still bothering them but with time batsmen learn more and adjust to the situations

3637949 se vieron las se as de identidad propias de espa a con una defensa muy agresiva para partirse literalmente la cara con el rival y no hay m s que mirar a nuria mart nez a partir de esa defensa con mucha actividad por parte de las cinco jugadoras fuimos inteligentes en ataque y funcionamos como bloque porque como individualidades no podemos
3637950 los xitos tienen que venir con la aportaci n de cada una de las jugadoras y ante la checas se vio que todas desde la primera hasta la duod cima aportaron algo

3637956 if you dont have a source of primary care then when you get service its going to occur in the emergency room and its going to be more expensive

3637965 it was mainly my family and we just started picking up a few neighbors here and there
3637966 we dont tell them no we see what we can do
3637967 it has been stable for at least the last five or six years
3637968 we dont have all the statements yet but i know no checks have been written on it in at least for the last five or six years judging from the lack of transactions it was more of a forgotten account
3637969 i was on the board at that time and i understood this matter had been dealt with and i want the members to know and the people here to know i want to know the truth and get it out to the public as quickly as possible
3637970 they need to re write the bylaws the problem is that they had the authority to do everything they did
3637971 we are trying to create another greatest generation of heroes and leaders
3637972 this allows a service member to choose what they want to do with their life rather than figuring out what they can afford
3637973 this is a different class of veteran its not the old days when they drafted people
3637974 if someone gives up a leg i think the government can afford to give them an education
3637975 i have gotten a lot of calls from recruiters saying not only does this make my job easier but it makes me feel better about doing my job
3637976 they can complete the degree in a shorter amount of time with less stress and a better experience

3637988 this is a complete departure from the forecast we were presented in may it is a 180 degree turn from what we were told but a pleasant 180
3637989 the manager has asked me to not go over details
3637990 she wants to do that at the public meeting thursday when she will present her entire report not only to council but to the world
3637991 we try to buy fuel at the lowest possible price but this summer we have seen a hefty increase in the cost of fuel over last year that is just like what we all are experiencing at the gas pump when we were paying about half what we are today for a gallon of gas
3637992 it was the perfect time to do this and they dont have to pay for advertising and promotion and they need that
3637993 he came and shook my hand and i guess he was mad cause i called myself the president im the president of h town i run this city after we shook our hands and had our words i went my way and the next thing you know he snuck up behind me and hit me on my side
3637994 then someone else jumped in and tried to hit me in my nose but i still got up there on the ozone awards and performed
3637995 its gonna get handled in the streets i came to the ozone awards for my song cutty buddy and he came from behind my back like a coward its sad we have to talk about this
3637996 fresh credit worries and the subsequent share falls on wall street are weighing on sentiment
3637997 despite oils falls investors remain cautious as concerns about fundamentals such as economies and corporate earnings pervade the markets
3637998 we remain wary of any rebound in oil and commodity prices as it could trigger a partial reversal of recent moves
3637999 although markets have moved quickly we expect further consolidation of new ranges up ahead and shift our euro dollar forecasts to 1 51 and 1 47 for 1 month and 3 months respectively

3638001 it is at this point that all parties lost sight of the young boy
3638002 the family are currently receiving care and support from a police family liaison officer
3638003 both the boy and his father are experienced padi approved divers and it is unknown why the boy went missing having initially surfaced with no apparent problems

3638005 the council has an agreement with dell to provide us with new equipment and dispose of the old equipment properly the vast majority of it has a resale value and they will be reconditioned and sold on any that have no resale value will be disposed of according to eu recycling standards
3638006 we are transforming the council to deliver excellent customer services and having the right it systems is crucial
3638007 the crucial question is whether the decision not to prosecute relied on the misconception that the dispatches film was inaccurate if it did the issue becomes whether wmp or the dpp were ultimately responsible for that misconception
3638008 i have argued that we are owed an enquiry into what has gone on and indeed why it happened and that to bury the matter would lead to confidence in the police being further undermined
3638009 i hope west midlands police can accept they have a problem with policing in the gay village area
3638010 the fact that i am not the only person this has happened to in the last year suggests they have a serious problem with homophobic police officers taking opportunities to abuse and harass gay men
3638011 i believe a frank and transparent public enquiry into the attitudes and activities of west midlands police is the only way forward to ensure that the gay community in the city gets the protection and service they deserve from the police
3638012 now out of the bottom 10 lowest performing education services in the country
3638013 im extremely pleased the government has upheld the objection we lodged the lack of consultation with the public and the affected property owners which is legally required has been disturbing
3638014 im not surprised by the governments decision we expected a public inquiry whilst the scheme will deliver 21st century library facilities for the town we must now await the inspectors decision
3638015 the black country has a proud heritage and was the cradle of the industrial revolution renowned world wide for engineering products
3638016 we now anticipate that the black country will be incorporated in the map title when ordnance survey next publish the map for this area when this occurs it will be a major boost to commerce and businesses
3638017 now necessary and unavoidable if we are going to feed the world in the future
3638018 gm foods will solve starvation among shareholders but not in the developing world
3638019 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3638020 appear premature based on the facts and evidence that congressional investigators and the inspector general have uncovered so far
3638021 i have made repeatedly clear that it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees
3638022 even if it is true they didnt commit a crime it would be appropriate to make what they did a misdemeanor so that in the future those who violate the civil service laws cannot escape unscathed

3638032 our buyers are almost all from china russia the gulf thailand india and the european union and we can barely keep up with their demand

3638039 when women feel like crying they tend to hide it what this kind of delicate feeling and lingerie have in common is that both are only revealed to the important person in a womans life
3638040 i designed my lingerie to look like the face of a crying woman to illustrate this similar trait
3638041 for my showpiece i was inspired by the glamour of the 30s i used a lot of high quality fabric such as silk and lace my main inspiration came from the little black dress which vogue magazine in 1935 described as nothing in fashion is as new

3638049 i cannot believe that i am here at this international award ceremony and that im meeting so many other designers and sharing experiences i am very happy and grateful for this opportunity

3638160 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3638161 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3638162 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3638206 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3638207 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades

3638242 wat me in elk geval erg is bijgebleven is hoezeer boston zich bij alles wat hij doet of wil gaan doen afvraagt wat de heere wil dat hij doen zal steeds weer gaat hij gods handelen gods voorzienigheid na
3638243 ik heb het idee dat mensen tegenwoordig heel slordig zijn als het gaat om gods voorzienigheid dat er vaak sprake is van hoe moet je dat zeggen wishful thinking zo van ik heb hier een goed gevoel bij dus moet dit gods weg wel zijn ik geloof dat we op dit punt veel van boston kunnen leren
3638244 vind ik ook altijd weer het bezig zijn van predikers als boston met het zielenheil van hun gemeenteleden
3638245 vanaf het moment dat ik mij hier in ettrick vestigde was de grote zaak waarnaar ik in mijn prediking streefde het volk het gevoel van hun behoefte aan christus in te prenten en hen ertoe te brengen over de grondslagen van de praktikale godsdienst na te denken
3638246 ik heb wel eens lopen denken over het boek van solomon stoddard
3638247 naar het heilig en rechtvaardig welbehagen van de soevereine formeerder van alles een dubbele hazenlip waardoor ze niet in staat was om te zuigen
3638248 erdoor getroffen als een aangeschoten vogel die uit een boom valt
3638249 desondanks droeg ik het waardig en mijn bezochte vrouw droeg de beproeving zeer christelijk en wijs zoals zij gewend was zo behaagde het mijn god mij terecht te wijzen vanwege mijn zonden tegenwicht te geven tegen mijn genoegens en mij te leren om hem voor het formeren van kinderen in de baarmoeder te erkennen

3638312 just after the track world cup last december i was out here with dan hunt womens coach and doug dailey logisitics manager in the cold and snow
3638313 i thought thats a hard hill i said that if id been on my road bike id be on the hoods a lot of the time
3638314 so we then thought about riding and designing a time trial bike with hoods so it was like a road bike its not as aerodynamic but if you can put more power down then its worth doing it
3638315 then i got back here and nobody else had dodgy handlebars and then i thought oh heck maybe id better change back
3638316 i had my gears on the hoods and i think actually that was the right choice because then i could imagine i was in a road race and off the front
3638317 in laymans terms it means you can go a lot faster
3638318 if youre less aerodymanic but you can go faster because youre more comfortable then its worth doing it

3638321 you want to know who theyre blaming for women voters breaking for hillary clinton over barack obama
3638322 theyre blaming chris matthews people are citing specifically chris not only for his own views but also as a symbol of what the mainstream media has done to hillary clinton
3638323 for matthews whod been enjoying near rapturous pleasure over the presumptive early season thumping of his personal hobgoblin there could not have been worse news than that his own commentary might have paved the way for clintons triumph yet here was just this headline delivered by maddow looking like sylvester the cat practically licking yellow feathers from the corners of her mouth
3638324 love is too weak a word to describe how some people feel about rachel maddow they lurve her loave her luff her
3638325 whats remarkable about maddows ascension is not its velocity hurricane katrina made anderson cooper in less than a week but the shifts in media it may demarcate maddow is one of the few left liberal women to bust open the world of tv punditry which has made icons of right wing commentators like ann coulter and michelle malkin unlike her beautiful bilious conservative female counterparts or the cocksure boys on the bus analysts however maddow didnt get here by bluster and bravado but with a combination of crisp thinking and galumphing good cheer

3638375 weve been acclimatizing to the altitude everyone is in good spirits and weve certainly confirmed that the race will be very very hard
3638376 the tour of utah is one that we can realistically win
3638377 we not only have a team of good climbers but a group of guys who perform very well at high altitude and those two things dont always go hand in hand
3638378 they have been kind of teasing that ive been director for the camp but obviously theres a lot more to being a team director than picking a few routes
3638379 seriously though i have been so excited for this camp and the race that i have been planning for months what i want to show the guys it is very motivating to have a race of this calibre in your own backyard
3638380 this is really more about acclimating than hard core training
3638381 the people at the place where we have been staying have taken great care of us so now all we have to do is worry about riding our bikes
3638382 i think the guys will see the benefit of having really done our homework
3638383 im pretty optimistic about utah it is a stage race where we should be able to perform very well
3638384 the courses are charismatic enough to make a real difference
3638385 there are some really big hard stages during the event and on a sporting level the race will be extremely interesting and difficult
3638386 the 2006 race was really a breakout race for both of them it was the first time they demonstrated themselves on a national stage and showed that even as 8 guys in a van they could put in really solid performances
3638387 the race in 2006 was pretty special for me as i was trying very hard to get a pro contract
3638388 this year will be different since i will race hard and focus on whats best for the team but the riding in utah really suits me so im excited
3638389 we are really motivated as a squad to work for each other and everyone on the team is riding very well
3638390 darren also lives in utah and is such a good climber he has to be considered a top favourite for the win
3638391 jonathan has been extremely impressive particularly because he has been injured a lot lately but is still riding so strongly bovay and nydam have come from wallonie with amazing form and are excellent climbers while brent bookwalter and ian mckissick were both training at altitude even before our camp so they are also tip top
3638392 with the team we have here wed ultimately like to win it
3638393 the winner should be pretty clear after saturdays queen stage with jeff and darren absolutely flying were ready
3638394 we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3638395 this goes a long way to help those survivors in their recovery
3638396 after all these years burying it deep inside suicide attempts i know that is wasnt my fault
3638397 i now can have a life without the fear and shame that surrounds the abuse that we victims have gone through
3638398 the best way i can express this is you never get over this you get used to it

3638406 discerning travellers expect the highest level of service and comfort the choices we have made for transport experiences accommodation and food and nz wine ensure that these are all inclusive in the tour thus providing maximum value for money
3638407 we are the first to do this on a sustainable platform with our coaches rated by vehicle testing new zealand as the cleanest running tour coaches in country and all of them fitted out with re cycling bins this means our customers can enjoy their vacation knowing that we are doing our up most to protect what they have largely come to experience the new zealand environment
3638408 the effort that tim and his team have put into promoting and spreading the word about these first and best in class tours is commendable it has been exciting challenging and incredibly hard work but the rewards are emerging in the form of excellent customer feedback and a strengthening forward booking pattern
3638409 like many new ventures we have experienced and felt pretty much every emotion from the excitement of launching through some disappointments to the satisfaction from our first bookings and receiving exceptional customer feedback all of which leaves us very optimistic about the future
3638410 in the end we will judge our success by our team spirit the new zealand luxury vacations and tour experiences we deliver the level of customers satisfaction we provide and the financial returns to the shareholders who have been so supportive in the launch of our company

3638441 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3638442 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3638443 this shows the risk of not going with a tried and tested solution
3638444 if our private health insurance system depends on one capped incentive or penalty to survive then weve got far more serious problems than people let on
3638445 i think its a much more delicate and complex balance than people are painting
3638446 we are happy to look at changes that might enable insurers to provide more attractive products
3638447 there are some regulatory constraints that are often raised with us
3638448 there is plenty of fertile ground for ensuring that there are more attractive products for consumers which i think ultimately is the most important way to attract people into private health insurance than a tax penalty

3638486 the chinese womens gymnastics team made history today showing the world the china womens gymnastics team is the greatest
3638487 before they go out there i want them to believe in themselves and they all did
3638488 i didnt have to say anything to them even though they are very young they have a lot of experience as well and they have their own ways to learn from their own experiences and they used those ways
3638489 we are human when it comes down to it we make mistakes and it came down to china had a better day today give us another day we could probably come out on top
3638490 i was just eager to do my routine and get the show on the road
3638491 the judges decided to hold me and i guess i just let my nerves get the best of me
3638492 just shake it off thats all you can do shake it off

3638503 i really didnt expect it im really excited people always used to call me either cute or pretty but no one ever called me sexy i take it as a compliment
3638504 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3638505 stardom has not changed me i believe i am the same person i am too new in the industry i like being in front of the camera and i love acting
3638506 im very close to my parents and they handle my money i even discuss my work with them every evening
3638507 gayatri is an independent girl who knows what she wants she is focussed she is modern as well as traditional in her thoughts the role is very similar to the person i am
3638508 right now we are focussing on our career and what we are doing in front of the camera at the end of the day we are both actors one plays a certain character in a film and so we cannot let possessiveness come in between we have to understand each other
3638509 i want to focus on commercial cinema as of now but if i find any offbeat film or a small production house with a good role i would love to go for it
3638510 im not the least ashamed of being almost 50 because i know i dont look it id like to think my physical fitness and my health consciousness would inspire more people once they know how old i actually i am therefore yes i can say proudly i am 47 and almost 50

3638524 i came up wanting to contribute and i hadnt been doing it peterson said

3638528 international experience has shown that as companies have become larger and their activities global and as society has become more litigious auditors have faced an increasing number of claims including many which if successful would be beyond their financial resources
3638529 without a means of limiting auditor liability audit fees might increase to cover the risks or firms would not be willing to accept appointments as auditors of higher risk entities
3638530 without protection auditors might also adopt a defensive risk averse approach to auditing

3638540 all broadcasters undertaking technically complex transmissions run the risk of occasional switching failures but the company says everyone involved is distressed at the timing of the glitch
3638541 though there are three most beautiful girls in the film ranbir simply rocks in the film be it the music video or the khuda jaane song
3638542 ranbirs dresses and looks change with time and have been worked upon a lot he can be seen trying all sorts of clothes that one can expect a guy from the age of 19 to 30 to wear
3638543 styling was very exciting and challenging as all three actresses are of different types and come at different times in ranbirs life so the styling had to be unique for everyone with no overlapping but one thing i can assure you all the looks would be unique and will have an aki stamp on it
3638544 minissha plays a small town girl from amritsar so i kept in mind the influences on fashion in amritsar her look in the film with the patiala salwars ganjee tops and jackets have already become a rage
3638545 she is the most fashionable girl from a metro with all the latest trends in fashion she can be seen wearing shorts jeans and other trendy dresses
3638546 there is always a bonus if we have an actress like bipasha in the film she is one of the best looking women with great attitude and an amazing body and her fashion background does makes a difference
3638547 her clothes are very functional its shirts high waist skinny jeans white legged jeans and has a tough look deepikas skinny jeans are the hottest thing right now
3638548 siddharth anand the director asked me to keep the look of the film young trendy and vibrant he said it has to be a hip hot and sexy looking film which it has finally turned out to be
3638549 kareena has a fantastic sense of attitude and style and she can carry off anything in the world
3638550 it must be centuries ago that i did my last tour
3638551 many many years ago i stopped doing shows at age 66 its not advisable to get back on the stage but the organisers managers and other artistes involved particularly aishwarya were very keen that i come along
3638552 what we do onstage is a reproduction of what we do on film so obviously music dancing and singing are an integral part
3638553 well perform huge choreographed numbers to recorded pieces but well also sing along and recite some dialogue from the films and interact with the audience
3638554 i think we all grew up hearing songs from amitabh bachchan movies in the car with our parents and film music and copying the movies choreographed dancing is really popular at indian pakistani weddings
3638555 that industry is a big part of our lives so i guess this show is a really big deal especially because who knows if amitabh will ever tour again
3638556 i thought of that 20 years ago and im back so one never knows im just thankful people still consider me a performer its very gratifying
3638557 there were some scenes that we thought to be too dangerous but she insisted on doing away with the body double and also the wirings
3638558 shes very athletic it runs in her family then there was akshay kumar to inspire her akshay had done so much on screen action it was a novel experience for deepika and she sailed through the action she worked really hard to get the posture and power in the action scenes those whove seen her in om shanti om will be shocked
3638559 the films flavour comes from akshays real life hes a boy from chandni chowk in old delhi who went to bangkok as a cook my writer sridhar raghavan wrote the role with akshays real life story in mind
3638560 the characters personality comes alive through akshay thanks to him we finished ahead of schedule
3638561 chandni chowk to china is a childrens film i dont think kids will try to attempt to climb the nearest wall to fight after watching the film but well have lots of kids joining karate classes
3638562 before i started making this film my interest in the martial arts was restricted to jackie chan et li bruce lee and the crouching tigers of the world but akshay brought out the hidden dragon in me
3638563 he made me watch a lot of action scenes before we left for china hed make me sit down every morning and make me watch one kung fu film and explain the subtexts by the time we left to shoot i understood the martial arts much better
3638564 all the shooting is done finally we indians have invaded china we were gone for 95 days we shot for 89 days in shanghai and in the interiors of china and lots of action sequences on top of the great wall of china

3638567 dan jika mereka cenderung kepada perdamaian maka cenderunglah kepadanya dan bertawakkallah kepada allah sesungguhnya dialah yang maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
3638568 dan jika mereka bermaksud hendak menipumu maka sesungguhnya cukuplah allah dia lah yang menguatkan mu dengan pertolongannya dan dengan orang orang yang beriman

3638587 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3638588 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat

3638622 the plucked dinner series has always been about plucking the best from literature theatre and other arts and im sure burroughss wry sense of humour wont disappoint
3638623 on a national level ive heard that there have been a number of pets abandoned because of foreclosure issues and the crisis i think those owners are in dire straits and need to do something and sometimes they just panic
3638624 the humane society has seen a huge increase this year of abandoned animals due to foreclosure or people just having to relocate because they cant afford their rent our numbers right now are over 140 cats at the shelter and we normally comfortably house 40
3638625 if you want to take an animal in its a lifelong commitment so make sure youre committed to that animal for 10 15 years and if at that time youre no longer able to keep that animal you need to start contacting local shelter as soon as possible

3638631 the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are obviously a crime it is a crime against its own people first and foremost
3638632 the aggression has resulted in numerous victims including those among civilians and has virtually led to a humanitarian catastrophe
3638633 the city itself is ruined there is no food or water
3638634 there are so many dead bodies lying on the streets it reminds me of the world war ii
3638635 the position of the western media mirrors the public opinion in the west u s and british media outlets lay the entire blame for the conflict on russia and ossetian separatists whereas german and italian publications tend to take a more reasonable stance in their reports
3638636 since georgia launched a major ground and air offensive to seize control of south ossetia on friday
3638637 president medvedev has issued a decree declaring aug 13 a day of mourning in russia for the humanitarian disaster in south ossetia
3638638 the general staff of the russian armed forces believes georgias reports on alleged bombing of the baku tbilisi ceyhan pipeline were aimed at drawing other states into the conflict as anatoly nogovitsyn deputy chief of general staff of russias armed forces stated today the reports aimed to get a response from turkey while a pipeline is not a worthy target for bombs
3638639 russias peacekeepers didnt enter georgia but for unrecognized abkhazia and south ossetia general staff deputy chief general colonel anatoly nogovitsyn specified during a briefing in moscow by making this statement the general refuted allegations of tbilisi about the capture of georgian towns by russian military

3638643 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3638644 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3638645 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3638646 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3638647 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent

3638654 i think those guys are so disgusting i would never fuck them as a matter of fact i would rather let a dog fuck me than fuck any of those guys i would rather have a dog eat me out than see those guys naked
3638655 we developed a connection with ice in charlotte on mills manufacturing i am grateful for their follow through and will continue to press this issue
3638656 it is wrong that this company has so flagrantly ignored immigration law and the importance of employing american workers
3638657 i dont know if its an innate thing or maybe it was bred into me but all of my life my parents were involved with charitable activities and we were brought up with the knowledge that one should spend some time giving back but doing it in a way which was a joy rather than a burden
3638658 everything i have ever done for the community has given me the greatest joy so it is always a surprise to be rewarded for something that you love doing anyway
3638659 it has been exciting to watch the way the community has evolved particularly in the eyes of the media who now give positive coverage to gay and lesbian activities
3638660 ive felt great pride watching aurora grow over the years and i still find it incredibly warming to see new people continue to dedicate their time and energy to fundraising for the community
3638661 as a professional publicist i dont really feel comfortable being the centre of attention but it is a great honour and i am very humbled and touched by it
3638662 for having done something i have truly enjoyed over a number of years and just having been a part of the community it is just a complete bonus to receive an award as well

3638665 it is ridiculous to ask us to do this because georgia will never use force against its own people it is as simple as that
3638666 when a married man is getting 400 haircuts you can bet a bottle of brandy he is cheating on his wife

3638668 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3638669 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3638670 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3638671 i dont know whether it is an appreciation to the teacher for the derogatory words
3638672 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3638673 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3638674 to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird i am speechless
3638675 it started to sink in a little after the butterfly i was trying to focus on my next race but i kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty neat title and im definitely honoured
3638676 when you have an olympic gold medal it stays with you forever it never gets old listening to your national anthem with a gold medal around your neck
3638677 i couldnt see anything for the last 100m my goggles pretty much filled up with water
3638678 it just kept getting worse and worse through the race and i was having trouble seeing the walls to be honest but its fine i wanted to break the record and wanted to go 1 51 or better but in the circumstances i guess its not too bad
3638679 the other countries out there were very very fast and we gave them a good fight
3638680 it wasnt the result we were looking for but we have just got to keep our heads up and keep our eyes on the target
3638681 the world of swimming is going forward a lot and we have just got to keep going with it
3638682 i went into this not even ranked in the top 10 so to finish sixth is pretty good ive done a personal best time in my main event
3638683 its been such a great experience and ive really enjoyed being part of this team i would like to go to 2012 but four years is a long time
3638684 i gave it my best shot and thats all i can do
3638685 my plan was to go out fast yesterday i went out easier and my coach said i should go out faster and i think im back to my normal self
3638686 ive gone out under world record pace before i died a lot on the last length and on the last few metres my arms were really struggling
3638687 i am delighted with the win and the performance and the way we played but its only one win and we wont get carried away
3638688 weve tried to put together a committed honest and hardworking team allied with the talent that was on show tonight
3638689 weve got a genuine bunch here and were all growing together but this is only one win and were now concentrating on gillingham on saturday which is already a massive game for us
3638690 i am flattered by celtics interest they are one of the biggest teams in the world and their fans are the best in the world
3638691 but newcastle have very good fans and i am flattered by their interest also but we have to wait it does not depend on me
3638692 there is so much that needs to be done for a transfer but a move to the united kingdom is the one i want to move my career forward
3638693 the premier league is appealing but celtic are the biggest team in scotland and are known everywhere so i dont know i love the united kingdom and that is all i can say
3638694 we saw that the african american population has declined by 40 8 percent since 1990 and as a share of the population decreased from 10 9 percent in 1990 to 6 5 percent in 2005
3638695 a lot of people mentioned the notion of being an outsider looking in
3638696 people can see a chinatown and a little italy but there wasnt an area of town that seemed to celebrate the african american community
3638697 we could paper the walls of this building with reports that have been made on this issue
3638698 id like to see you coming to church on sunday to naacp meetings to be down in the trenches walking arm in arm
3638699 let me know next time theres a naacp meeting and ill be there
3638700 committee to stop the blank check a coalition of concerned consumers small businesses labor community organizations and pacific gas and electric company
3638701 the fact is this proposal is backed by many of the same supervisors who are trying to build fossil fuel power plants in san francisco
3638702 those are the things that create stability in the long run
3638703 it was funny at first making deposits none of the bankers knew what was going on ida what are you talking about they had to go get their supervisors
3638704 this reaches those folks who are at the edge of falling either way either building assets and being productive or falling the other direction and struggling needing other kinds of assistance
3638705 the goal is to lift families into a more stable and self sufficient situation so that after two years they will have a livable wage
3638706 is madonna the material girl now immaterial is she still relevant
3638707 most of the time spears didnt even try to hide the fact that she was faking it smacking her gum like a cow chewing its cud instead of mouthing words
3638708 you dont even think of stuff like this happening here its just crazy
3638709 at halloween they decorated a lot and loved the kids to come
3638710 he collected videos and would come and tell us he was selling them if we were interested
3638711 just on rare occasions id run into them outside and wed talk for a bit
3638712 it is exactly what it appears to be on the first day
3638713 right now there has been no previous contact that would indicate anything like that violence would occur
3638714 earlier in the summer we anticipated that she was going to appear in the show but those plans were postponed for personal reasons on ms spellings behalf
3638715 we did not achieve our ambitious target of moving across five million customers before the end of june
3638716 we will migrate five million by the end of september and well be moving from five to seven million by the end of the year
3638717 i cant give you a number off the top of my head because youll quote me on it and next year youll say sol you said thered be this many
3638718 that process is going to begin in the month of august and will be part of both tr1 and tr2 as we think about the systems the business side will continue into the next calendar year
3638719 some of us were brand new to the company and in october we did an inventory with people that had been here 20 to 30 years with telstra and we identified we had 1250 systems
3638720 as we got into it six nine twelve months later we found out we had 1 500 systems
3638721 theres a lot of complexity to this and the variability of plus or minus ten or twenty months that could be part of the story
3638722 theyre going to be close whether were off by five to ten to twenty here or there i dont know whether thats going to be the case
3638723 the second half of the year youll start seeing a bit of a diminution but itll be close to that figure
3638724 you forgot the lowpass and used a comb instead but look at your hair its full of kaviar ben
3638725 only for those who believe it and run after it for the rest of us we merely dream about it and wish we had the fairy wand to make it appear
3638726 at first you would seem to be correct for those who do recognize love as available and ready for their use they are the ones who choose to benefit from its spiritual intimacy giftedness and wealth of opportunity
3638727 is the follow up comment of how there seems to exist a fragment of the worlds populace who seem left to only dream and wish love would come riding in on a white horse in the form of prince valiant or that love somehow requires a magic wand and a few hocus pocus words
3638728 if what you are asserting are real feelings at present you might count your self among the minority whose dreams seem locked in a circular conversation alone before your mirror
3638729 we are not nor will we ever be aware of what defines love for you we do not know who might have helped define for you what you know about how love works but what we can say is that were as clueless about how love works as you each of us have learned a flawed version or vision for what defines love all of us have been where you seemingly feel your self to be in love limbo
3638730 is to be willing to understand appreciate and accept how much of a part of showing your self you are both loving and lovable all have some measure of how that is expressed each of us to some extent recognize a certain peace we might call happiness glowing within
3638731 happiness is not a place you arrive at it is where you are
3638732 councils decision to endorse a homophobia free zone on oxford st is yet another token pr effort from this lord mayor
3638733 the best response to homophobia and gay bashing is more and tougher high visibility policing applying an aggressive zero tolerance policy the last thing we need is homophobia free zone signs along oxford st it will not prevent one bashing and may even attract more violence
3638734 homophobic violence is based on ignorance and fear around homosexuality so even though some people say that its tokenism i dont think an initiative like this in an area like oxford st could be a bad thing because if promoted well its really about consciousness raising
3638735 as for all the other ideas that have been proposed i think we should do them all shayne mallard moved a motion a while ago to trial some extra police and i supported that i would also like to see a return of the safety bus which used to run along oxford st
3638736 this will be an action packed event with non stop games
3638737 freezone conducts two annual tournaments as well as playing in melbourne and adelaide events with the melbourne spikers and the adelaide spikers
3638738 this will be a great chance to see our state league teams mixed into a more social setting which everyone can enjoy
3638739 to be a cheerleader you have to be there on time be outrageously dressed with a focus on glitter and pom poms and begin your cheering choreography as the day begins loud is good
3638740 if you are not in a team we will endeavour to place you in one there are always gaps and extras required on the day
3638741 both parties have been looking at forming some type of relationship for some years now there are natural synergies in relation to readership of the sso and its community roots and the sglbas demographic which is corporate and small business employers and employees who want to be involved in the wider gay and lesbian community
3638742 we are looking forward to being able to provide our small business members with add on benefits like advertising discounts as well as being able to donate monies to worthy gay and lesbian community charities
3638743 the sso has a strong history and sense of commitment to recording the people events and organisations which shape the glbt community in sydney and australia
3638744 a partnership like this not only enables us to create strong ties with the business leaders from our community but also helps the wider community as a whole
3638745 we are so annoyed because we knew we had to be spot on with the wording but someone at the agency changed it we should have picked it up
3638746 this was a genuine human error and was an innocent oversight
3638747 four points is all about lifes simple pleasures uncomplicated comfort and the small things that make people smile when we set out to design our retail site our goal was to curate a unique selection of items that truly bring to life the brands personality and core values
3638748 even with the challenging market conditions and current oil prices we remain confident about the long term success of both our asian and australian based airlines
3638749 clearly oil has been a challenge for all airlines but were not seeing the impact that some other airlines are seeing in europe and north america of reducing demand
3638750 i think a three year period from start to profitability is reasonable and certainly that was our target
3638751 and were delighted that tiger singapore has delivered a very robust set of figures for the last financial year which was its third full year of operations i think the other thing to reinforce is that tiger singapore is an entirely independent carrier
3638752 unlike the relationship jetstar has with qantas we didnt benefit from passengers being forcibly moved from one airline to the other we didnt inherit routes and we dont network plan our services with majority shareholder singapore airlines or anyone else
3638753 its the united states post office and theres no flag just an empty pole
3638754 im going to send you away i can only discuss this with residents
3638755 if the pole belongs to us well make sure to put a flag there
3638756 obviously it would be a requirement to raise significant funds for the book we would be taking over
3638757 die erholung der buckelwal population ist direkt auf den walfang stopp zur ckzuf hren
3638758 das ist eigentlich eine ziemliche deutliche antwort von allen gro walen sind die buckelwale diejenigen die am besten gedeihen wenn man sie in ruhe l t
3638759 japans regierung hatte im november 2007 beschlossen eine quote von 50 buckelwalen zu fangen
3638760 die buckelwale die die japaner t ten wollten sind jene mit denen die staaten gutes geld beim wal beobachten erzielen
3638761 auch wenn sich die best nde erholt haben sind sie immer noch meilenweit davon entfernt auch nur ann hernd jene zahl zu erreichen die sie vor dem anfang des kommerziellen walfangs hatten
3638762 das ergebnis war erstaunlich denn diese sippschaft die aus rund 50 tieren bestand blieb unter sich
3638763 sebagai orang kuat indonesia selama 32 tahun terakhir soeharto membawa negaranya yang luas dari kemiskinan besar besaran menjadi lumayan sejahtera tahun tahun pertumbuhan ekonomi tinggi yang mantap nampaknya menjadikan jenderal purnawirawan itu cocok menyandang gelar bapak pembangunan
3638764 rakyat indonesia akan memperoleh kesempatan untuk menjatuhkan pilihan sesuai konstitusi tentu saja segenap rakyat akan menyambut baik gagasan pemilu
3638765 paling tidak pada pemilihan presiden tahun 2009 keadaan seperti itu masih akan terjadi sikap inferior akibat pemerintahan orde baru yang disokong sepenuhnya kekuatan militer berkuasa terlalu lama sehingga masih ada orang yang berpikir militer paling kompeten
3638766 dalam pemilihan langsung di indonesia mereka yang akan memenangi persaingan adalah yang dikenal disukai dan dianggap pantas oleh para pemilih
3638767 sebetulnya masalah petani adalah masalah kemerdekaan bagaimana kita mau merdeka bila lapar
3638768 setelah indosat lalu diumumkan bni 46 akan dijual ke pihak asing dulu kakek saya almarhum margono djojohadikusumo diperintahkan bung karno dan bung hatta untuk mendirikan bank milik indonesia yang pertama dan sekarang akan dijual artinya telekomunikasi dijual dan bank bank juga dijual kita akan jadi kacung di negara kita sendiri
3638769 kalau putus asa rakyat bisa terbawa oleh radikalisme kiri atau kanan atau demagog penghasut yang menggunakan fanatisme agama suku ataupun yang lain kalau demokrasi tidak bisa menghasilkan lapisan pemimpin yang kuat dan bersih dan hanya memunculkan koruptor maka demokrasi gagal kalau eksperimen demokrasi gagal maka yang muncul orang yang terus menerus memanfaatkan permainan korup
3638770 negara ini amat kaya hanya sekarang bagaimana me manage nya
3638771 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3638772 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3638773 sadly it was his childrens greed that precipitated his downfall but he has left a tremendous legacy for indonesia and his people
3638774 sedihnya keserakahan anak anaknyalah yang memicu kejatuhannya namun dia telah meninggalkan warisan yang luar biasa bagi indonesia dan rakyatnya
3638775 he was the one who from the start had the foresight to look for the positive traits in president soeharto hubert is right without president soeharto in the countrys driving seat he might never have come to indonesia for his work assignment and we would never have met
3638776 dialah yang dari awal sekali memiliki pandangan ke depan untuk mencari sisi positif dalam diri presiden soeharto
3638777 in fact one positive finding of my research is that over 950 mosques have been built thousands of orphanages have obtained financial assistance and thousands of students have received scholarships in addition to contributions towards the building of hospitals schools health centres and the like
3638778 no because i was busy looking for the gold hidden under tommys bed the whole night
3638779 tidak karena sepanjang malam saya sibuk mencari cari emas yang disembunyikan di bawah ranjang tommy
3638780 it was during that visit that pak harto agreed that i should write this book especially to clarify the concept underlying the foundations he had built he appeared to have been convinced by my fathers last words mas harto let her write the book for indonesias youngest generation so that they may understand our history from our perspective
3638781 pada saat itulah pak harto setuju bahwa saya harus menulis buku ini terutama untuk menjernihkan konsep di balik pendirian sejumlah yayasan yang dibangunnya
3638782 it was not surprising that pak harto and my father were never politically close
3638783 certainly my father had met with pak harto as the president on a regular basis but the meetings had been official and formal even though my father was appointed his advisor their relationships had been lukewarm during that period of time
3638784 her father indonesian statesman roeslan abdulgani had a close personal dan professional relationship with president soeharto
3638785 mao ruled for twenty seven years if the past as he believed is indeed a mirror for the present will the twenty first century mark the start of a third chinese golden age for which maoist dictatorship will have opened the way or will it be his fate to be remembered as a flawed colossus who brought fundamental change on a scale that only a handful of others had managed in all the years of chinas history but then failed to follow through
3638786 history is laid down slowly in china a final verdict on maos place in the annals of his countrys past is still a very long way off
3638787 um an der spitze zu bleiben ist es wichtig mit einem motivierten team zu arbeiten gute marktstrategien zu haben und durch perfekte serviceleistungen zu berzeugen

3638791 the fact that suvinil was selected as the best decorative paint brand at the paint e pintura competition recognizes our ongoing investment in our products we know exactly what our customers want and need and this allows us to offer them perfect support through our unique service and special programs the distinction confirms that the strategy were pursuing is the right one

3638793 wir stellen konsequent landesmittel f r unsere erfolgreiche struktur und regionalpolitik zur verf gung dank der aufhebung der haushaltssperren bei der regionalen wirtschaftsf rderung k nnen wir jetzt zus tzliche mittel des bundes in h he von derzeit knapp 10 mio euro in anspruch nehmen

3638801 all three are special they are amazing and awesome its great that i got to work with three beautiful women
3638802 i always believe i am not a good dancer i become nervous while shooting a dance sequence so its a collective effort that you see on screen
3638803 it is a journey of a young man raj and three women who enter in his life at different phases
3638804 it is a youthful character he is not a casanova
3638805 i had signed the movie when saawariya had not released
3638806 please dont compare me with dad our song is just a tribute to that song
3638807 i like dads flamboyant style i have been proud of his work and learnt a lot from him
3638808 consumption of premium internet video content to date has been low
3638809 services have been available only on less than optimal screens pcs and portable multimedia players but new connected products that link to premium internet video services are emerging at a rapid pace moving the internet video viewing experience into the living room this shift will help grow revenues considerably
3638810 a spirit had assembled all of earths creatures his task was to find the right animal to become a companion to human beings who had not yet been created he asked the animals how they would treat people some said they would tear human beings apart others said they would live near people to steal their food the dog said his only wish was to live with people share their food help them hunt guard their children and possessions even at risk to his own life another legend states that a dogs life originally spanned 20 years but that the dog willingly gave up 10 of his own years so people could live longer
3638811 wed been looking for my husband for six weeks and this isnt how we wanted it to end at least we can close this
3638812 i got the sense she was trying to tell me where her master was
3638813 i had no intention to take the photos i like a good pun and collecting the names and word play a drag name will lend itself to a visual representation its all subjective
3638814 ultimately it was a really joyful creative project im used to working in television and film where i would write the script and leave it to the mercy of other people to get it produced in this case it stayed in my hands so it was a really good project to see it through
3638815 it was a lot of work and nerve wracking especially in the beginning because i really had no idea of what i was doing
3638816 shooting drag queens in a variety of contexts is very funny and i admire their ability to create something out of a shoestring budget the picture with cher noble was very funny because we had to break into this walled off area at an oil refinery
3638817 it was raining we were trespassing and we had 10 minutes to get the shoot done so we broke into this hole in the fence and just went for it i was worried we were going to get arrested
3638818 the federation is hoping that thousands of messages of support will be sent to matthew as a sign of appreciation of all out athletes who practise sport at every level
3638819 we had a good response to the offer for members seating that we publicised earlier in the year which means for the first time there will be 13 gay and lesbian soccer fans seated together at every home game at the sydney football stadium
3638820 were still trying to raise awareness though for people who might want to join in and get involved we would ultimately like to establish a social network for gay supporters of all the a league clubs
3638821 this years agm is a significant event for the sglba
3638822 not only do we have several board positions open for election but we will also be launching our new website

3638824 the new website has enhanced features for our members will lead to increased traffic to the site and improves the operational efficiency of the sglba for future expansion its a great step
3638825 danny will discuss topics relating to getting started in small business in the environmental space and we will hear about his latest projects in this field
3638826 saya pikir mereka mencari lagu yang clean cut dan membosankan saat saya merilis single itu saya berencana untuk melakukannya di hari yang sama dengan premier ini akan menjadi hits besar jika mereka berubah pikiran saya menunggu
3638827 sekarang sedang kita bicarakan dengan kapolres untuk meminta sheila dipisahkan dengan tahanan yang lain mengingat usia sheila masih 18 jalan 19 tahun secara psikologis dia masih tergolong remaja atau anak yang masih membutuhkan dampingan

3638830 no doubt it would not have happened were you not so drunk that night but the fact you were drunk does not afford any real mitigation the fact you would not have done it had you been sober makes no difference to her

3638834 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3638835 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3638836 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3638837 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3638838 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3638839 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3638840 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3638841 from our perspective this fills a void in our lineup that has existed since we moved andy mcdonald
3638842 i intend to start skating here in mid august i dont think im really behind schedule that way barring a setback im right on target right now

3638851 the underlying driver of commodity intensive infrastructure investment in developing countries remains unchanged short term risks remain but the opportunities are there for investors corporates that can look through the haze of negativity
3638852 the super cycle bull market for commodity stocks that has been underway since early this decade has not been a one way street with a number of meaningful corrections that have tested the resolve of the market
3638853 trading these spikes and troughs in the mining stocks is not without risks but is undeniably a highly rewarding strategy for those that are nimble enough and have the courage to look through the current negative haze surrounding the sector
3638854 the only reason for not stepping up and buying the sector after this recent correction is a belief that the cycle is not well and truly over and commodity prices will fall further
3638855 this point is critical as china is after all the key driver of the commodity super cycle

3638879 today with global communications with the integration of the global economy with the ability of actors to operate at long distances
3638880 its possible that failed states at great distances from the united states and of course closer can represent a national security danger
3638881 over the past 20 years over the course of 17 significant stabilization and reconstruction missions in which the united states has been involved too much of the effort has been borne by our men and women in uniform

3638888 i have grave concern with the image of the united states as bad as it is around the world at this point that putting u s personnel on the ground will generate this kind of nationalist response against the united states and then imperil the people who weve deployed there
3638889 what will be the political outcry in washington if you have u s personnel from the state department being killed

3638892 there have been dozens and dozens and dozens of failed states that have existed throughout the world over the past 15 or 20 years and yet we have one data point to revert back to afghanistan in which there was actually a pressing threat to u s national security that happened to emerge from a failed state
3638893 anyone who looked at pictures of the twin towers on september 11 cannot say that failed states are not an issue

3639074 we are human when it comes down to it we make mistakes and it came down to china had a better day today give us another day we could probably come out on top
3639075 i was just eager to do my routine and get the show on the road
3639076 the judges decided to hold me and i guess i just let my nerves get the best of me
3639077 just shake it off thats all you can do shake it off
3639078 i guess it was a little too hard to get out of the funk
3639079 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry
3639080 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
3639081 russia now flush with cash wants to rebuild its 19th century imperial sphere of influence in the former soviet union
3639082 it also wants to make an example out of georgia to other nato aspirants what the chinese call kill the chicken to take care of the monkey so the ukrainians will think russia would use force to prevent them from joining nato

3639091 der umsatz fiel wie erwartet aus mit dem ebitda und dem berschuss hat kl co allerdings im vergleich zu den vorl ufigen zahlen positiv berrascht
3639092 gleichzeitig wird die marge auf basis des gewinns vor zinsen und steuern ebit leicht r ckl ufig sein sollte aber nicht unter das hohe niveau des gesch ftsjahres 2006 von rund 16 prozent sinken

3639096 dass jolie pitts kinder bekommt macht sie aber abh ngiger und verletzbarer die verantwortung f r ihre kinder hindert sie daran ihre fl gel auszubreiten und sich nach etwas anderem umzusehen weitere schwangerschaften sind vielleicht eine gute idee

3639100 the 100 a ranking of the most influential persons in history
3639101 ive got no reports of any border incidents any cross border incidents so it wasnt us
3639102 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3639103 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3639104 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3639105 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3639106 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3639107 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3639108 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3639109 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3639110 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3639111 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3639112 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3639113 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3639114 its just not responsible to be saying things like that

3639118 well i guess u guys dont know how much i mean when i say i dont get out much
3639119 no ha pasado nada de hecho lesley no quer a que arrestasen a alan hayden estaba fuera cuando su padre fue arrestado y luego ste la llam desde la c rcel ellos se mucho quieren el uno al otro y quieren que todos sepan que a los problemas se les ha dado una importancia desproporcionada
3639120 when i have my children ill get up and make them pancakes
3639121 i just dont know what six months from now will bring or three months but as it is right now the conservator is doing exactly what it is supposed to do this is the way i live one day at a time
3639122 that was special but it was also strange because jamie s always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool and she was happy when she got to the hospital we all thought it was going to be an all day thing and instead the baby just sort of popped out okay were happy now
3639123 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3639124 look at them they have the little bitty baby teeth
3639125 its as big a problem as doping it is more blatant cheating than doping its a slap in the face to the whole world shame on them but theres nothing you can do about it
3639126 the only thing they can do is abolish the age limit
3639127 we will continue to argue for fuelwatch well wait and see what happens
3639128 i mean nick xenophon with due respect hasnt yet been sworn in as a senator hasnt yet sat there in the senate
3639129 i cant support the governments scheme it just doesnt make sense
3639130 there are unintended consequences it could kill independent operators in terms of wiping them out and it will consolidate the big oil players
3639131 were still wanting to understand how it wont push petrol prices up and we also want to know how fuelwatch wont squeeze out independents
3639132 until we are satisfied with those two questions family first cant support fuelwatch
3639133 if senator xenophon or any other senator has suggestions that they can make to make the legislation more acceptable to them which dont undermine the governments fundamental policy objectives to give consumers and motorists a better go then wed be happy to consider it
3639134 youre dealing with the majors theyre big bureaucracies theyre slow
3639135 yes theyve got enormous power but a quick nimble independent can work around them
3639136 and certainly a number of the independents in perth have said theyve been able to gain an advantage
3639137 so theyre just able to go in and squeeze out the independents
3639138 why should the motorists of australia not have access to the same price information that the good motorists of western australia have had for many years
3639139 the liberals are the ones who control this in the senate and what the liberals have done federally is to side with big oil companies against consumers
3639140 the onus now is on mr rudd to deliver a scheme which will provide cheaper petrol to australian motorists
3639141 we wont stand in the way of a scheme which reduces petrol prices for motorists but we wont support fuelwatch as a political tool used by mr rudd to try and give himself some cover

3639159 it is casting it is a technical decision by the producers you have to put that in the context of the opening ceremony and the complexity of the 15 000 performers
3639160 i think it is a decision of the group of the directors together they are to achieve the most theatrical effect for the benefit of the whole performance the whole opening ceremony

3639166 wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3639167 i think we can close the gap because manchester united were at the very top of their game last season but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3639168 the new manager has come in and made a few changes hes made some great signings deco looks awesome so im excited to see him play

3639332 he felt like they were best friends then and felt like he should be able to chat with them after the concert
3639333 as soon as he got up this morning he had to blast the beach boys on the stereo

3639400 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3639401 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3639402 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3639403 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3639406 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3639407 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3639408 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3639409 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3639410 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3639411 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3639412 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3639413 it just shows all the things were doing in education are working and students are doing better
3639414 we still have a long way to go to have the number of students prepared to really compete in todays world economy
3639415 we still have far too many students graduating from high school without the skills necessary to succeed
3639416 i was kind of overwhelmed with a lot of the work that had to be done
3639417 shes changed her mind a couple of times one day shes against it one day shes for it what we need is consistent leadership
3639418 i dont think you give carte blanche to the oil companies i think you have to have some conditions
3639419 thats a more reasonable approach rather than porters approach which is just to say drill drill drill
3639420 i think its all a result of the great dissatisfaction people feel for the way the country is going people want to see change and i think people see dean heller as part of the problem and more of the same
3639421 i will continue to fight for a sensible energy policy that lowers gas prices fiscal responsibility and smaller government and secure our nations borders and the enforcement of our current immigration laws

3639430 this is horrible millions of americans are losing their houses and now theyre not even going to have cars to sleep in
3639431 when all is said and done we wouldnt be surprised to see very little global oil demand growth over this year and next
3639432 even if retail prices ease it seems unlikely that motorists who have purchased smaller cars will revert to gas guzzling vehicles
3639433 nevertheless the transition to a more fuel efficient u s fleet will take some time
3639434 in a couple of years time when things settle down well point back and say that was the peak and well all be trying to analyze when we get back to that peak again which i think we will
3639435 this is my third olympics one of the biggest privileges is wearing the stars and stripes now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it sounds weird to say it it started settling in after the butterfly
3639436 i kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title im definitely honored
3639437 ive been on this relay for the past four years
3639438 thats something we talked about getting under seven minutes to do it here is very special its a great feeling it was a goal
3639439 i knew there was nothing i could do i had two caps on i couldnt rip them off i just had to swim for the finish and the 150 wall i couldnt see i was more or less counting strokes i know how many strokes i take for a 50 i was disappointed i know i can go faster than that its disappointing to me that i did have a goggle malfunction
3639440 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration
3639441 we believe ubs investment bank will be not fully owned and even potentially disposed of by ubs over the next two years
3639442 we had a lot of work to do obviously to get in a position where apple and at amp t would feel good about best buy mobile carrying it and thats what weve done in the last 18 months
3639443 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3639444 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america to the middle class in the middle of the last century and talk about the basic bargain as about the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today
3639445 the presidential candidate would obviously like her to say this is just the greatest person in the world and ive seen the error of my ways and you should vote for him
3639446 but the other candidate may have other motives and sour feelings
3639447 with bill we dont ever know what hes going to do and he feels more attacked and unfairly treated than she does
3639448 the worst thing he could say is that youre nominating the wrong person and that well be back in four years
3639449 this is as close to the perfect storm as the bank can get
3639450 no company no matter how well managed can avoid being impacted by weaknesses in its core business
3639451 management expects continued deterioration in credit trends for the consumer portfolios which will likely require additions to the consumer loan loss allowance during the remainder of 2008
3639452 anybody who tells you they know when the housing market will bottom is delusional but anybody who denies there are some positives out there that could make the housing market bottom fairly soon is equally delusional

3639456 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3639457 in the wake of this conflict there is no way that we can proceed with this joint exercise at this time
3639458 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
3639459 russia has much more to lose than the soviet union had to lose in 1968

3639477 its that simple people want me to use johnson in the seventh inning and to be honest with you i dont think thats the right call your starting pitching dictates what you do youve got to play the game correctly and youve got to set your bullpen correctly
3639478 just executing pitches it doesnt matter how many innings ive thrown
3639479 i just didnt execute a couple of pitches by hitting choo i really didnt start the inning off the way i wanted to
3639480 probably wouldve gotten out of hand real quick if olson didnt settle down
3639481 im not pleased what happened that first inning i felt like when i got to two outs i should have closed it right there and i didnt as a result i put the team in a hole its hard to come back even though we did come back and tie the game it probably would have been a different story if that didnt happen

3639486 they made tsigns and one of them asked me for my views on tibet i said i was a journalist and had no views on tibet
3639487 i did not at any time try to unfurl a banner and i have never possessed any banner or protest material i was there simply to report on a demonstration not to take part in it in any way
3639488 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand
3639489 if they think this is the way to go we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness then you count me out i think it will be an absolute disaster

3639498 being at the top with so many great athletes who have walked in these olympic games is a pretty amazing feeling
3639499 i dove in and my goggles just filled right up with water
3639500 it got worse and worse through the race going into the 150 meter wall and the finish i couldnt see the wall i was just hoping i was winning and hoping i could get my hand on the wall first
3639501 hes competed against the past hes competed against the history books hes competed against time expectations and everyone who came before him
3639502 but most of all hes competed against himself congratulations michael on having won more gold medals than anybody ever
3639503 it might be once in a century youd see something like this
3639504 the way hes attacking this meet hes not just winning hes destroying it its awesome to watch its inspiring to me
3639505 one thing that separates michael from most people if they dont feel good they dont swim well
3639506 michael kind of performs independently of his feelings i think hes practiced it over a long time he knows exactly what he wants to accomplish and hes able to just compartmentalize whats important
3639507 that may be one of the reasons im swimming so fast ive never been this relaxed ive been through all this before and thats one of the reasons im able to be like this
3639508 the fact that its not done yet and we thought it would get done earlier that makes it a concern
3639509 we really dont have much in the way of progress to report at this present time

3639513 you never want that at the end of the day but fortunately youre not penalized as much as you used to be and your pick is more or less deferred but thats not the result you want on draft day
3639514 im more concerned with the starters going longer in the game than i am about making a move
3639515 well maybe get a good starting performance out of garrett olson tonight and that will take care of the other stuff
3639516 until im told otherwise or until a decision is made thats what it is
3639517 the rotation stays the way it is we have a couple of days yet before i have to make a decision on that one if something were to happen
3639518 look if your starter doesnt go deep its hard to win games
3639519 it really is it taxes the whole bullpen and we dont have that deep of a bullpen right now i dont mean that knocking on anybody its just not a deep bullpen as it was when it first started with the injuries and the trades its frustrating as hell you look up and you score eight runs and you lose it ticks me off as a pitcher you take pride in that
3639520 its the kind of thing you can get by with for a couple of days
3639521 but by the time you get to day 8 or 9 its a lot harder
3639522 physiologically phelps has obviously trained his body to do it
3639523 its basic stuff that frankly they should be getting right
3639524 they make up a substantial portion of our force and we couldnt function in afghanistan without them
3639525 individuals not only served in theatre but paid an extra price
3639526 it is the committees belief that canadian military personnel wounded in the service of their country should receive one standard of rehabilitative treatment when they return home first class
3639527 overt discouragement of attendance of a witness whos been summoned would constitute basis for contempt
3639528 would be a matter which should be or could be subject to its own investigation
3639529 thats what they told me they said you dont have to come
3639530 she said it but shes from the party she would contact whoever the executive director is those people would decide or doug finley the partys top political organizer hes the guy that would im sure all people would be spoken to yes
3639531 if thats part of a pattern then its some attempt to steer if not to interfere with the witnesses i resent it
3639532 mr lowry is a standup guy hes telling the truth i think theyre digging themselves into a deep deep hole everything the conservatives are doing has the stink of desperation all over it
3639533 we set out to create the most entertaining online golf experience possible with shot online and the game has a loyal following
3639534 with season 2 we have made enhancements that our players have told us would make their experience even more enjoyable we know that players will love the new characters courses and modes and more
3639535 its basic stuff that frankly they should be getting right
3639536 they make up a substantial portion of our force and we couldnt function in afghanistan without them
3639537 individuals not only served in theatre but paid an extra price
3639538 it is the committees belief that canadian military personnel wounded in the service of their country should receive one standard of rehabilitative treatment when they return home first class
3639539 if all provinces cannot or will not provide this first class level of treatment the federal government should step in and ensure that it is made available to every wounded returnee
3639540 im the doctor im a time lord im 903 years old and im the man whos going to save your lives and all six billion people on the planet below you got a problem with that
3639541 no one else made mistakes so its kind of my fault
3639542 look at them they have the little bitty baby teeth
3639543 its as big a problem as doping it is more blatant cheating than doping its a slap in the face to the whole world shame on them but theres nothing you can do about it
3639544 the only thing they can do is abolish the age limit
3639545 it was the image of our national music our national culture
3639546 mostly an animated three dimensional video that was made over a year it was not actually live footage except the final stage
3639547 i would really have liked a medal but i swam my best time
3639548 i cant be upset with that and im just moving on to the next race
3639549 i did this double at the trials so i was confident i could pull it off here
3639550 i wasnt as fast as i wanted in the 200 im
3639551 people say dont worry about it think of it as just another meet its not just another meet
3639552 if you had to peak there it is very fatiguing and difficult to get that peak back
3639553 michael didnt peak at trials and you can see what he is doing here
3639554 on the outside it looks like shes disappointed but she has her head up high now and shes a tough tough kid
3639555 the format isnt easy but every time she has been beaten its been by a great swim
3639556 the georgia crisis serves as a warning to countries such as ukraine and moldova that they should desist from petitioning for nato entry
3639557 otherwise moscow may intervene to protect the allegedly threatened interests of the russian population
3639558 russia now flush with cash wants to rebuild its 19th century imperial sphere of influence in the former soviet union
3639559 it also wants to make an example out of georgia to other nato aspirants what the chinese call kill the chicken to take care of the monkey so the ukrainians will think russia would use force to prevent them from joining nato
3639560 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
3639561 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
3639562 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
3639563 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
3639564 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early
3639565 instructions are being developed and being sent to boards of election across the state to make sure voting is consistent
3639566 there is no question that the huge effort to register and turn out voters at ohio state university is going to have a positive impact on our race
3639567 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the democratic party
3639568 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3639569 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3639570 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3639571 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3639572 its just not responsible to be saying things like that
3639573 was owned by hon amama mbabazi the minister of internal security and also secretary general of the nrm
3639574 that to manage conflict of interest arma ltd be advised to transfer their land to mr amos nzeyi for purposes of transacting with the fund
3639575 mr amos nzeyi be asked to present a resolution and powers of attorney issued by arma ltd authorising him on their behalf to transact with the fund in respect of their piece of land
3639576 objected to the decision to purchase the wakiso land on grounds that there was political pressure being exerted on the fund to purchase the land
3639577 despite assurances that there was no political influence on the transaction director cm olweny maintained his position and his objection was duly recorded
3639578 we didnt at all transact with mr amama but with a company called arma ltd
3639579 ppda was not meant to handle investment issues it deals mainly with procurements for consumption
3639580 call him and you will get nothing out of that story
3639581 i am going to do my best in beijing and improve where my mother did not reach
3639582 in adopting a negotiations strategy for epas with the european union uganda has to address some important regulatory issues related to quality control within the education sector
3639583 joint ventures and collaborations between well established institutions and universities in the eu with ugandan institutions will ease the market entry and consolidation challenge of the education sector for higher education in the regional market
3639584 judge williams essentially has the position that you cant do a long term offender designation without a period of community supervision
3639585 counsel for mr aylward and myself having reviewed the exact same provisions are of a different position were of the position that parliament has clearly mandated a regime that does allow for a long term offender designation without a period of community supervision
3639586 i would suspect that will weigh very heavily against him if and when he does make an application to be released on parole
3639587 mr aylward is very much aware of the fact that what he did was very wrong
3639588 he is remorseful one of the reasons there was a guilty plea was that he did not want the young victim of this crime to have to come to court and testify and that was one of the things that weighed very heavily on him
3639589 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip syncing now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3639590 but this time china is so big and growing so fast we are really concentrating on china

3639595 im going to try my best to get every medal
3639596 i missed the bar it happened im not going to think about it
3639597 but whatever happens were witnessing an incredible level of talent in this sport that we havent seen before the all around is going to be a great show to watch the difficulty is going to be incredible
3639598 fabian because of his fall and tomita after his first night here have something to prove so i expect them to have good performances
3639599 hes an incredible gymnast im pretty sure hes going to show the world he is someone to pay attention to for a long time to come
3639600 record labels have been screwing us for so long with high cd prices and albums with only one or two good songs those record exec fatcats with their expense accounts and private jets they deserve this im just sticking it to the man
3639601 i went into this competition different than any other competition ive done where i knew that i was already here i earned my spot at the olympics and now it was all for me
3639602 i didnt want to come here and me be the only one to lift and not give it everything i had
3639603 he was here to support me i needed to make some lifts i wanted to be happy i wanted him to be happy for me
3639604 you could tell she was out there having a good time and lifting her heart out
3639605 i was just thinking to myself this is the last lift girl you do this
3639606 thats what i kept telling myself dont let yourself be disappointed after youre done with this no matter happens if i make two lifts or six lifts whatever i just wanted to leave with a smile and i did exactly that
3639607 i was filled with just sheer joy knowing it was the last one of the
3639608 while i respect governor carters sensitivity to the needs of blacks and women i do not feel that the country is ready to accept a woman in the second highest office in the land
3639609 however when that time does come i plan to be ready
3639610 we made progress up to the 70s but so much more progress needs to be made to get america ready because the very question that is being raised there would be no reason for the question if we were ready nobody would ask are we ready we would just move along

3639620 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3639621 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3639622 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3639623 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3639624 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3639625 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3639626 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3639627 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

3639649 right then and there i just wanted to dedicate and put a lot of focus into getting into the best shape of my life
3639650 its going to go down to the wire and thats the way it should be
3639651 give both players every opportunity to show what theyve got
3639652 he always has to be talking has to be moving
3639653 back in the day i used to be a bit dirty under the piles
3639654 but the cameras see everything plus its just part of growing up and being smarter and not wanting to put your team in a bad situation get a penalty do anything that will hurt your chances of winning the game

3639657 every loss at home is a terrible loss but what are we going to do put our heads down then were only going to get more terrible losses
3639658 he has a very good engine he makes deep runs from the midfield which make it very complicated for people either you follow him through the midfield or you loosen up someone from the back to mark him
3639659 hed score three or four goals and hed come home and not talk about it
3639660 right off the bat you could see how much he loved playing with the ball
3639661 anyone who has seen him play will tell you he has what it takes to become a superstar
3639662 and i dont think it was easy for him either

3639674 this is a clear indication of the societys perception of the disease
3639675 these improved my quality of life i dont feel as if anything is missing in my body
3639676 we are facing problems with husbands of women living with breast cancer refusing to let their spouses to come for services at our office

3639696 find new ways of managing carbon emissions to limit climate change
3639697 but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas such as oil sands
3639698 im not sure if they are going to go through
3639699 if the iraqi government decides it wants international oil companies to partner with them in developing their resources exxon mobil would be interested in participating
3639700 es gibt mehr im leben als den t glichen verkehr zu beobachten und streunende katzen an sich urinieren zu lassen
3639701 der heinzelmann ging vor vielen vielen monaten verloren und ich habe ihn total vergessen
3639702 dann habe ich die t r aufgemacht und gesehen dass er zur ck war welch ein schock
3639703 i dont think i am beautiful i can look good and i can look ugly whats funny is that when i was younger i wanted everyone to look at me now i like to watch other people because you can learn a lot of interesting things
3639704 tera and angelina are friends and keep in touch via e mail
3639705 shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
3639706 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3639707 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true
3639708 i love the ronsons theyre close to my and i respect all the work they do
3639709 i had just watched scarface and i dont think i spoke
3639710 ich habe sehr diszipliniert gefochten es war vielleicht von den aktionen her nicht brillant aber ich war sehr kompakt und habe die spannung gehalten und seine fehler gut ausgen tzt
3639711 aber dieses mal war er vorbereitet auf mich und hat weniger fehler gemacht
3639712 es ist schon so hnlich verlaufen wie ich mir das erwartet habe er hat viel offensiver gefochten ich war schon bereit aber nur wissen dass es kommt reicht nicht
3639713 und da hat er dann ein bisschen mehr routine und ein bisschen mehr wille gezeigt ich war mir zu unsicher im infight ich wusste nicht wo ich hin will er hat keine zehntel gezweifelt deshalb hat er diese treffer gesetzt das war der unterschied
3639714 als ich einmal zu besuch in berlin war bin ich bei der suche nach einer toilette am alexanderplatz fast verzweifelt
3639715 die hygienestandards der toilette die ich nach langer suche gefunden hatte lie en zu w nschen brig aus diesem erlebnis ist dann die idee entstanden eine toilettensuchmaschine mit bewertungssystem zu erfinden
3639716 mein freund christian rohowski und ich haben vor dem start von lootogo de ungef hr hundert toiletten selbst getestet
3639717 mit der zeit entwickelt man einen kennerblick f r hochwertige wcs immer wenn ich irgendwo unterwegs bin halte ich ausschau nach toiletten und benutze sie auch gleich damit ich sie bewerten kann
3639718 but its a ferrarri ill be hes just using it wrong
3639719 our inquiry is being reviewed by higher authorities and will also accommodate the findings of the un
3639720 be promptly and thoroughly investigated and if proven strict and exemplary action would be taken
3639721 ive got no reports of any any cross border incidents so it wasnt us
3639722 han sido determinantes para que la antrop loga roxana ferllini haya confirmar la identidad del comandante
3639723 al ser un alto mando militar la ley ordenaba que previamente a su ejecuci n se celebrara un juicio que nunca ocurri y los responsables de la guardia civil en lugo y quienes los asesinaron lo sab an creemos que esa puede ser una de las razones de que los enterraran en la frontera pero fuera de su jurisdicci n as se lavaban las manos
3639724 resulta muy curioso que no existan diligencias abiertas sobre los ocurrido con un distinguido miembro de falange
3639725 es un caso curioso porque normalmente tienes los nombres de los desaparecidos y hay que localizar la fosa pero en este caso era todo lo contrario
3639726 primero descartamos los que se exiliaron enfermaron o de los que hay un certificado de defunci n posterior sab amos que adem s de militares eran anarquistas y el campo se redujo a unos 40
3639727 fue algo realmente emocionante darles la noticia y ver su reacci n
3639728 to have her die where she was built its completely weirding me out
3639729 the next trip was planned to maine to sail with my dad who is 93 who helped me dream of it but who hasnt ever stepped foot on the boat
3639730 this is going to be quite an exclamation point at the end of the book
3639731 the first firefighter had fire trucks pulled out of the hall just in case the hall would catch fire where we were so close
3639732 with the heavy fire load with epoxies glues resins and a boat in there burning we had to look at what we could save and what we couldnt save
3639733 the worst thing is when steel roofing comes down you cant get underneath to get the fire out
3639734 it sounded like a party going on down here with fireworks there was popping and banging and explosions
3639735 we all packed up and went up to the church on top of the hill there and stayed there until 7 a m
3639736 and where theres so much damage and devastation done here it may be undetermined
3639737 this has been a tragic loss to the community to employees to our customers as well as to the owners of the yard
3639738 weve lost a lot of things that are non replaceable a lot of historical and nautical artifacts our archives and drawings
3639739 we have been considering other locations that would allow us to build larger yachts and have local launching and hauling capabilities

3639746 his anti war posture might be attractive to obama but hes anathema to much of the progressive base of the
3639747 i think though it is impossible to predict with absolute confidence that the delegates would not deliver their votes unless at a minimum he switched political parties
3639748 hes not a good man when it comes to everything else and he hasnt voted well in any way shape or form that would gain any support from me or any other thinking democrat
3639749 hagel couldnt keep his mouth shut long enough to be somebodys no 2
3639750 its tough to be someones no 2 when youre used to making your own decisions
3639751 its just not responsible to be saying things like that
3639752 in terms of the number of students who are ready this year compared to last we are talking about genuine progress
3639753 more students are reaching at least a minimum level of readiness for college credit courses were keeping a lot of kids from having to take remedial level courses that translates to millions of dollars that are being saved at the state level
3639754 we have a more heterogeneous population of test takers so were including those kids who werent considering college or arent considering college

3639757 id be very surprised if this hasnt arrived in the uk by 2009
3639758 ive been farming for 33 years and this was probably one of the hardest springs ive had putting a crop in
3639759 i just planted it wet and hoped mother nature would keep sending the rain to get it up
3639760 the more severe their slowdown the greater the likelihood that it will begin to cool the boom in exports
3639761 the weak dollar has become a major driver of economic growth
3639762 the question is are we really on a rebounding curve or are we just seeing a little bit of strength in the october quarter and then more softness after that
3639763 its something sabes and i have talked about ill leave it at that
3639764 hes got to adjust a little better hes got to discipline himself a little better
3639765 its hard enough when youre facing major league pitchers when youre chasing pitches out of the zone it gives the pitchers a lot more options
3639766 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3639767 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3639768 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3639769 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3639770 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3639771 i didnt want to jump from one 20 hour technology day to another
3639772 and of course theres the parties the beautiful women the fun parts of it as well
3639773 a lot of folks when they have wealth find things that will be interesting and unique to their lives
3639774 whether youre a starlet or a rock star everybody wants to have their name on a label
3639775 the hump from startup to real company thats where they fall
3639776 the number of fashion parties ive been to has been small compared to the amount of time ive spent sending something back to the factory
3639777 for an industry so focused on the new and the next theyre very backward for things that will make them more efficient
3639778 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3639779 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
3639780 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick
3639781 the pool of individuals who are u s born and have insurance still make up a huge number
3639782 for individuals who have chronic issues this is a very serious problem
3639783 i feel healthy but two years ago i broke my ankle playing soccer and since that day i had to see a doctor and to buy health insurance
3639784 for latino people who watch a lot of tv everything that tv says is true
3639785 i dont feel comfortable because the exam is not in my language
3639786 anybody who has bought a property at one of these sites is being kept up to date but this is an issue between us and the buyer the reason is the downturn in the housing market
3639787 obviously once we start to see a pick up in the market things will start moving forward again
3639788 interest in the quayside apartments is already huge and its easy to see why you just cant beat the location it is superb
3639789 this is the latest but i fear not the last such blow to the cardiff economy many warned there were too many flats being built in the bay

3639793 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3639794 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3639795 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3639796 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3639797 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3639798 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about
3639799 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting
3639800 can you leave me alone im trying to get gas and this is really harassment please leave me alone
3639801 theres a lot of evidence that the more patients are required to pay more for their care the more that they make economic decisions about what to get or what not
3639802 while some of that may be perfectly reasonable and acceptable what i worry about is people not getting care that is really essential for their health
3639803 yes we know when people have comprehensive health insurance they have a tendency to overuse and access that care more than they absolutely need
3639804 a little bit of discipline may be all right but i would want to err on the side of making sure they can get sufficient care
3639805 we know from past economic downturns that employers and individuals tighten their budgets as a whole but they certainly tighten their health budgets
3639806 we in san francisco have been an island of prosperity but were starting to see things that are concerning
3639807 joining forces with the industry leader will enable us to improve our financial performance above and beyond what we could do independently
3639808 this acquisition accelerates our expansion into central and northern california and hawaii
3639809 site selection in northern and central california is pretty costly and time consuming we estimate the time frame needed to assemble a quality portfolio like the longs stores we are acquiring would be at least 10 years
3639810 there are opportunities for some relocations maybe 10 to 15 percent of the fleet over time but there is no rush in doing that
3639811 longs has done a lot of things to improve its operations and some make it more compatible with the way cvs does business

3639815 it was a dream come true just to race here
3639816 was to reach over the table and punch the doctor who was giving me the news
3639817 if certain tests had come back elevated my parents would have stepped in
3639818 they have great athletes when they go through more experiences like this youre going to see a rise
3639819 were playing at our home and the crowd was going wild
3639820 we were a little bit nervous weve had other international games but this was the olympics
3639821 its been a lot of buildup five years of buildup to this one day im proud of my team
3639822 record labels have been screwing us for so long with high cd prices and albums with only one or two good songs those record exec fatcats with their expense accounts and private jets they deserve this im just sticking it to the man

3639824 development in all fields is often two steps forward and sometimes two steps back
3639825 we used to have a programme which we started some years ago where we would send in rowing in a box
3639826 we would have these containers and they can be made into a small boathouses with say six boats and oars in there and we send them out
3639827 then they can put them out at the side of a lake open them and then start rowing
3639828 i feel guilty sometimes when you want these people to train because they need peace food and security and then i ask them to go rowing and they do it and they love it but still i feel like an idiot
3639829 even to participate in the olympics is a great progress for any country and it gives them local exposure
3639830 they get publicity and the sport is recognised even if the results are poor they are coming back as heroes
3639831 and we are happy for all the small steps we can take it will come but probably not in my time and that doesnt mean i want to die tomorrow
3639832 the international baseball federation has confirmed the test it was done outside the olympic period starting on july 27
3639833 we learned about the news yesterday afternoon and it is very regrettable
3639834 i have already notified all the players on our team and told them that since now we only have 23 players we should give even better performance during the games
3639835 i feel today they did their job and did a good job
3639836 the medications are not illegal but theyre banned for olympics athletes
3639837 im not clear on what happened im not a doctor
3639838 someone told me at the top that i had the best time but i really couldnt celebrate until the last person crossed the finish line
3639839 if youre less aerodynamic but more comfortable and you can go faster then its worth it
3639840 i knew when i came here in december when it was freezing and snowing that it was a hard climb
3639841 i knew when i was four seconds down from emma that i had to turn it on in a big way i knew they would both be strong on the downhill
3639842 i heard on my radio earpiece that i was behind emma
3639843 i knew she was a strong rider but i wasnt too worried i knew the best part for me was still to come
3639844 this course was uphill so it didnt really suit me

3639847 ranbirs dresses and looks change with time and have been worked upon a lot he can be seen trying all sorts of clothes that one can expect a guy from the age of 19 to 30 to wear
3639848 styling was very exciting and challenging as all three actresses are of different types and come at different times in ranbirs life so the styling had to be unique for everyone with no overlapping but one thing i can assure you all the looks would be unique and will have an aki stamp on it
3639849 minissha plays a small town girl from amritsar so i kept in mind the influences on fashion in amritsar her look in the film with the patiala salwars ganjee tops and jackets have already become a rage

3639851 there is always a bonus if we have an actress like bipasha in the film she is one of the best looking women with great attitude and an amazing body and her fashion background does makes a difference
3639852 her clothes are very functional its shirts high waist skinny jeans white legged jeans and has a tough look deepikas skinny jeans are the hottest thing right now

3639883 i really didnt expect it im really excited people always used to call me either cute or pretty but no one ever called me sexy i take it as a compliment
3639884 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense
3639885 stardom has not changed me i believe i am the same person i am too new in the industry i like being in front of the camera and i love acting

3639888 right now we are focussing on our career and what we are doing in front of the camera at the end of the day we are both actors one plays a certain character in a film and so we cannot let possessiveness come in between we have to understand each other
3639889 i want to focus on commercial cinema as of now but if i find any offbeat film or a small production house with a good role i would love to go for it

3639918 one of the reasons is that we have become more effective as new legislation at the beginning of the year gave us new possibilities
3639919 though he has made recommendations for the authorities to address this the unabated murders are a stark reality that none of his recommendations have so far been implemented
3639920 its going to be a battle weve played them so many times
3639921 we have a good feeling for them and familiarity with them but its always a battle well be prepared and excited for that game
3639922 we played canada many times so we know them very well and they know us very well
3639923 whoever can get that olympic spirit find that positive feeling and play good soccer will win the game
3639924 we bounced back and its exciting because we still havent played our best soccer
3639925 ive been a part of this team for a couple years and i feel like ive played them so much
3639926 we know how they play and its going to be a definite battle they are a strong team and have some really good players were going to forget about new zealand and keep trying to elevate our game

3639931 irrespective of who rules the country who is the prime minister or president there are no good rehabilitation programmes for street children and even those which exist dont reach the needy nobody is bothered about such people poverty is the biggest problem

3639933 discerning travellers expect the highest level of service and comfort the choices we have made for transport experiences accommodation and food and nz wine ensure that these are all inclusive in the tour thus providing maximum value for money
3639934 we are the first to do this on a sustainable platform with our coaches rated by vehicle testing new zealand as the cleanest running tour coaches in country and all of them fitted out with re cycling bins this means our customers can enjoy their vacation knowing that we are doing our up most to protect what they have largely come to experience the new zealand environment
3639935 the effort that tim and his team have put into promoting and spreading the word about these first and best in class tours is commendable it has been exciting challenging and incredibly hard work but the rewards are emerging in the form of excellent customer feedback and a strengthening forward booking pattern
3639936 like many new ventures we have experienced and felt pretty much every emotion from the excitement of launching through some disappointments to the satisfaction from our first bookings and receiving exceptional customer feedback all of which leaves us very optimistic about the future
3639937 in the end we will judge our success by our team spirit the new zealand luxury vacations and tour experiences we deliver the level of customers satisfaction we provide and the financial returns to the shareholders who have been so supportive in the launch of our company

3639947 what makes patty patricia heaton so important to us is that shes one of those rare actresses who can go toe to toe with kelsey who can be just as strong as he is in a way that doesnt make her seem un likable
