8520016 in abercromby street where my practice is the average male life expectancy is about 53 years old
8520017 there is a high incidence of mental illness like depression which leads to a number of organic problems
8520018 its not surprising that we see more cases of heart disease stroke diabetes asthma and bronchitis than areas like lenzie
8520019 one of the postal sectors here has the lowest income in the uk
8520020 that means people have less money to spend on basics like food clothes and travel to work
8520021 this is made worse by other social problems like poor housing and community safety
8520022 the area also has serious problems with gang and knife culture and of course drug and alcohol abuse which are colossal contributors to early death
8520023 over the last two or three years weve had more and more patients asking for help to stop smoking
8520024 thats great and we do all we can to help but there are other things which government can do
8520025 in recent times we have dealt with advertising of cigarettes and then with smoking in public places
8520026 but i believe that advertising for alcohol and junk food should also be tackled
8520027 steel production is a seasonal business with prices declining from year to year in the fourth quarter
8520028 i dont think the peak of steel prices has been passed prices for steel and rolled metal will be higher in 2009 than in 2008
8520029 in 2007 at least 26 states made efforts to expand coverage but as the economy has turned downward so have state efforts
8520030 reminds us that americans are suffering in a struggling economy too many of our neighbors are living in poverty and too many are living without health insurance
8520031 todays news confirms what americas struggling families already know that over the past seven years our economy has moved backwards
8520032 while this decline is a temporary victory for kids we fear next years data will paint a worse picture for americas children than ever before as the effects of a sluggish economy will be coupled with the inability of congress to pass renewal of schip over president bushs two vetoes
8520033 are expensive and when tax revenues fall it is going to be harder to keep them up
8520034 we have a much weaker economy than a year ago much higher inflation very unlikely that this trend will continue into 2008
8520035 an opportunity for the private sector and the government to work together
8520036 states such as massachusetts have also played an important role in stemming the rising tide of uninsured and thanks to their health reform law they now have one of the lowest uninsured rates
8520037 but 45 7 million uninsured people are far too many and we need a national solution to this crisis
8520038 were entirely attributable to an increase in the number of people enrolled in medicaid and other public programs
8520039 is clear is that economic growth alone will not cut it for most american families
8520040 means more progressive taxation increasing access to affordable health care investing more in public education
8520041 president bush was too busy cutting taxes on top earners to think about any of these priorities the next president must do much better
8520042 truth be told we already have a government funded health care system we just pretend we dont
8520043 theres this supposed mix of private and public insurance but the fact is the u s government you know we the taxpayers spend nearly a quarter more for government health care programs than say canada a country that is supposed to have government controlled health care
8520044 looks great until you see that whats declining is private insurance coverage and whats increasing is the number of people eligible for government programs such as medicaid
8520045 its time to organize government health care into a single payer system one that covers all u s residents
8520046 a closer inspection of the numbers shows some dark clouds around the silver lining
8520047 while total enrollment in private insurance remained stable due to population growth it eroded slightly in percentage terms continuing a downward trend
8520048 growth in coverage was mostly concentrated in public programs partially due to an aging population shifting to medicare but especially in medicaid
8520049 each year a significant portion of the uninsured qualifies for government assistance but hasnt signed up
8520050 in other words the latest batch of data shows again that the policy problem of the uninsured isnt as large as election year opportunism would have it
8520051 the genuine hardships that the fragmented health care system metes out to many families
8520052 insurance is more expensive than it needs to be thanks to regulation and other market interference
8520053 who typically have less generous plans as part of their compensation
8520054 restoring the tax parity of health dollars would allow individuals to buy policies themselves rather than rely on their employers and take those policies with them wherever they work
8520055 wir machen uns sorgen dass diese bewegung f r den n chsten da zu sein immer mehr in den hintergrund ger t

8520058 this is the first time im sounding a note of caution about the future i am afraid this time we see a kind of consumer strike now with people refusing to spend money

8520063 the overall site plan of this rectangle this sort of square and lets have a circle i frankly think its not a lot more than that
8520064 it also comes with huge limitations that come from conceiving a building as a pure circle

8520072 every expenditure we make can be looked at i dont expect everyone to agree with everything but its available

8520074 our ultimate goal is to see the university progress toward transparency on how student fees are spent
8520075 were sensitive to the heat and the stress its going to put on our fans
8520076 thats why we believe the two for one water is the right thing to do
8520077 it can alter blood pressure organ function and kidney function
8520078 if you combine alcohol with something that is getting it into the bloodstream even faster you get a higher amount of alcohol entering the bloodstream in less time thus higher intoxication levels and more risk
8520079 our goal is to keep the university up and running and safe

8520084 the bottom line is all the ingredients are there for this storm to really gain in intensity
8520085 the hurricane centers last track had it coming in just on the east side of new orleans

8520093 we aim to go through the major cities of the east coast
8520094 the greenway is a little bit of everything especially at this stage
8520095 one of the problems is that everybody wants the trail to go through their area because they see the economic benefit

8520107 obama has nothing he has no experience the democratic party doesnt care about us you couldnt treat clinton any worse
8520108 almost exactly two years after the d80 was announced comes its replacement the rather predictably named d90 the d80 has been one of nikons quiet successes and even today despite being positively methuselah like in digital camera terms it continues to sell and often makes its way into our top 10 most clicked on cameras because it looks so similar to the d80 the d90 appears at first glance to be one of those rather subdued incremental upgrades but dig a little deeper and youll find theres plenty to keep nikon fans happy

8520110 stop doing that nonsense you just did the thing you just did when we passed the temple
8520111 arre i was talking about the act of prostration you did in front of the temple that was the sixth time you were doing it six temples and six times you go through the routine and each routine lasts what 40 seconds i am getting irritated here
8520112 see i dont understand what your problem is i do that whenever i see a temple you might say that my devotion to god is a little exaggerated but i dont care what you think this is the way i have lived my life the sole reason for what i am at the moment is god and its my duty to seek his blessings i dont see any reason for that to irritate you
8520113 i am a staunch atheist and i find such excessive adulation towards an idea as crazy as gods preposterous i know you wont understand but i think i have a few things to learn i have to learn not to belittle others beliefs i am really sorry if i hurt you in anyway
8520114 thats ok but may be you have to change your idea about god
8520115 thats more or less impossible and to copy your own line this is the way i have lived my life anyways i had vowed that i wont pick up the topic of god during any conversation with anyone lets stop this

8520118 oh its about bill clinton and the lady whats her name monica or something
8520119 no stupid monica lewinsky was not a hollywood actress the characters in this book closely resemble john f kennedy and marylin monroe
8520120 i was surprised at her casual tone when she uttered sex scandal i being one of those few men who flinch at the word sex or anything related to it the surprise turned to shock in a few seconds

8520168 our catholic institutions will not honor catholic politicians who take pro abortion legislative positions or invite them to speak at our functions or schools
8520169 i would say that as long as senator bidens stated position on abortion remains the same then it would apply to senator biden whether he was a senator or the vice president of any type of public figure
8520170 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena

8520175 four more years of the same out of touch policies that created an economic disaster at home a disastrous foreign policy abroad four more years of the same divisive politics thats all about tearing people down instead of lifting the country up

8520184 i think the last eight years have destroyed 200 years of respect for this country i think the republican party is corrupt through and through they have been in office too long they are too adept at thievery and moving the constitution into places it was never meant to go i think they have an extraordinary ability to divide rather than unite
8520185 i think the last eight years have destroyed 200 years of respect
8520186 enough of this division well unite this country by labeling all people with different political beliefs as thieves constitutional criminals and the personification of shiva destroyer of worlds unity

8520198 with respect to the words general welfare i have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers enumerated in the constitution connected with them to take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators
8520199 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
8520200 i cannot find any authority in the constitution for public charity such spending would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the union of these states is founded
8520201 federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character
8520202 i feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan to indulge in benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public funds
8520203 we must always ask is government working to liberate and empower the individual is it creating incentives for people to produce save invest and profit from legitimate risks and honest toil is it encouraging all of us to reach for the stars or does it seek to compel command and coerce people into submission and dependence ask these questions because no matter where you look today you will see that development depends on economic freedom
8520204 you make that sound keith i can do the same to you okay thats what i thought all right and i said it
8520205 discussing hillary clintons upcoming speech matthews began talking about women s reactions to hillary his producers likely wary of any more cries of sexism against the host and the network presumably tried to get him to wrap as he said ill wrap in a second ill wrap in a second
8520206 olbermann then tried to attribute matthews point about women voters to rachel maddow to which matthews said good ideas can be shared
8520207 then when introducing steny hoyer olbermann mocked matthews for going off at the mouth and made a hand gesture implying that matthews talked forever

8520217 ive been to a lot of conventions but this one has
8520218 mccains the only republican i can tolerate because hes a maverick and hes funny chiding bush on the daily show
8520219 mccain is the single worst piece of vile to ever walk this earth they shouldve tortured him for ten years

8520221 why are those mean liberals picking on us we only wanted to lower everyones taxes and get rid of that baddie saddam hussein

8520230 it is a little bit disconcerting to see what feminism has evolved into

8520234 after this rapist had hit his victim several times in her face she stopped resisting and begged all right just dont hurt me

8520239 our good disposition determines the amount of grace we obtain

8520343 we do understand canadians frustration with fuel price volatility in particular but at the same time in our view thats the best evidence of a well functioning competitive market
8520344 in our view canadians are well served by a competitive marketplace and today they still pay the second lowest price for fuel in the western world
8520345 the oil companies are making huge profits when consumers are dinged at the pumps
8520346 its not the folks who are delivering fuel to canadians all over that are making money
8520347 at least 70 per cent of canadas gas stations see no benefit from rising prices but rather profits are declining as a result of increased credit card costs
8520348 the price of diesel affects every economic sector because it affects public transportation it affects the cost of goods that are transported

8520393 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning
8520394 such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning between subliminal signals present in a given situation and choice outcomes
8520395 we reasoned that if subjects were unable to correctly perceive any difference between the masked cues then they were also unable to build conscious representations of cue outcome associations
8520396 the ventral striatum responded to subliminal cues and to visible outcomes in a manner that closely approximates our computational algorithm expressing reward expected values and prediction errors
8520397 we conclude that even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8520398 some developers who are seeking help have resorted to paying each other 1 that way if challenged by apples legal department they can argue that they are subcontractors and therefore free to discuss the software
8520399 at my company our lawyers advised us to keep what we considered more or less public software under nda for a very long time because demoing software to someone under nda no matter how many people it is avoids publishing the software and any inventions contained therein we know apples been building up a patent strategy around multi touch maybe their lawyers believe there are patentable inventions described in the iphone sdk and they are telling apple to keep everything under nda until they know provisional patents can be filed within a reasonable amount of time you get a year after publishing in the us but in the eu i think you forfeit any patent claims once your invention is published
8520400 every invention in the iphone sdk is a non published invention and will continue to be so until the nda is lifted

8520420 tapi jika format gerai makro nantinya diubah menjadi hipermarket maka dapat dipastikan akan terjadi peningkatan omset carrefour yang signifikan
8520421 bisa saja setelah melakukan akuisisi terhadap makro omset carrefour mencapai rp 10 triliun atau bahkan lebih
8520422 sebab para investor baru akan mempunyai pikiran bahwa peluang bisnis retail sudah dikuasai oleh carrefour jadi apa untungnya berbisnis retail di indonesia lebih baik mencari negara lain atau investasi di bidang yang lain
8520423 bandingkan dengan ramayana yang hanya memiliki omset sebesar rp 4 8 triliun itu berarti omset carrefour dua kali omset ramayana dengan begitu carrefour akan menciptakan market power di indonesia

8520441 the sacred is still embraced as significant and holy but without necessarily being identified as part of a church

8520455 it is incumbent on the prosecution to do this in order to establish to the necessary degree that the accused had an intent to defraud when he forged and uttered the documents in support of his claims
8520456 in the circumstances it is not necessary to make any finding as to whether or not the accused had an honest belief that he was entitled to claim as he did
8520457 for these reasons i conclude that while the accused acted dishonestly in making the claims that he did it has not been established that he did so with the necessary intent to defraud
8520458 accordingly in due course there will be a judgment of acquittal in respect of each of the charges
8520459 im very pleased its been a very significant toll on myself and my family
8520460 its cost me a million dollars in financial costs and an unbelievable toll in personal and psychological costs
8520461 these failures were a cause of the accident which resulted in the death of daniel burman
8520462 it hit the ground the impact had a catapult effect
8520463 burman fell out of his harness because he was not wearing it properly he fell approximately ten metres to the ground and died almost instantly
8520464 it would be to my knowledge the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in this jurisdiction and a significant penalty in the country for offences of this type
8520465 i expect that these breaches of the act are not at the top of the range nevertheless they are serious matters
8520466 if you leave an emergency department overcrowded staffing ratios arent kept and elderly patients unfortunately will fall and its a risk
8520467 i have some suspicions and i know of a couple of cases of people who have actually fallen off trolleys but id like to follow it up and double check to make sure what actually happened to them long term
8520468 pressure areas occur people dont get fed properly and get sleep deprived because being in an emergency department our lights are on 24 hours a day seven days a week and they dont get good sleep
8520469 one of the ways that may be delivered is by dropping elective surgery in certain areas for a short period of time
8520470 theres been pressure for the last few weeks and we have been watching this with great concern
8520471 now it has reached absolute crisis point to the extent that the emergency medicine specialists are asking to use surgical beds too to make sure that patients actually receive the care they need
8520472 the ambassador outlined the russian federations position on recent developments in georgia
8520473 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8520474 mr smith stated that it would only be through dialogue and a cooperative approach that tensions in the region and internationally would be reduced and a long term resolution of the issue achieved
8520475 there are not over a hundred people in the united states who hate the catholic church there are millions however who hate what they wrongly believe to be the catholic church which is of course quite a different thing
8520476 he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities
8520477 ought not christ to have suffered these things and so to enter into his glory

8520482 the church does not object to rights already established in california regarding hospitalization and medical care fair housing and employment rights or probate rights so long as these do not infringe on the integrity of the family or the constitutional rights of churches and their adherents to administer and practice their religion free from government interference
8520483 regarding hospitalization and medical care fair housing and employment rights or probate rights
8520484 are exactly like marriage but in name only do es not become the laws in the states
8520485 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalize with a photo already had a photo set against it
8520486 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8520487 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good
8520488 well luckily she did not get fired it was test photos that was accidentally left on the iphone nbsp seraphin
8520489 some music enthusiasts in the city had come to me and expressed willingness to donate their priceless collections to the university of pune the university will preserve this collection by creating a dedicated music library
8520490 we will digitise all the records so that they can be preserved for a long time we have plans to make this collection available online
8520491 we are also planning to record some of the speeches at emmrc before a selected gathering
8520492 we have designed courses like mobile repairing and beautician the idea is to motivate students to seek self employment we are also planning to involve high school drop outs in the programme
8520493 there will be three courses foundation intermediate and advance which will enable the learners to form an idea about information technology to start with 1 000 faculty members will be trained training is necessary as the university of pune will be launching a triple connectivity project in a few months
8520494 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
8520495 every year we do one classic with our batch this year we wanted to do tagore because his plays make you indulge in a complete experience of directing a play his plays demand the best of props acting skills lighting and sound use of space on stage too form an indispensable part in his plays
8520496 the play is a poetic image so we needed some one who could very well string the technical aspects of sound light and props together because nature is the main element throughout the play
8520497 directing tagores play is always a challenge because he uses a lot of visual imagery here also for this play we have created a huge moon a bamboo grove and a river which are instrumental in taking the story further this play especially provides a lot of opportunity to work on the technical and aesthetic aspects of a play
8520498 we feel we are most real when we touch upon something that can no longer be rationalised when we no longer have to pretend to understand something we do not
8520499 such behaviours have violated the law and show signs of breaching some articles of the penal code
8520500 there was a subversion of the constitution on november 3 and that is what people are protesting against
8520501 we are committed to the supremacy of the constitution and this will continue until the actions of november 3 are reversed
8520502 we had seen him good before and we wanted to see that livan
8520503 if we had a runner in scoring position we would have hit for him but that said hes not a rookie
8520504 he has pitched in big games before hes an experienced pitcher
8520505 i had people call me and the manager tell me i just needed to pitch like i can pitch
8520506 they told me i didnt have to be perfect i have 11 years in the big leagues i know what im supposed to do
8520507 when you go to a new team you want to go out and be perfect to show people what you can do
8520508 you want to make your new team happy that you are with them but nobody is perfect what i had to do was pitch the way i pitch

8520519 it made me feel a bit sick to my stomach

8520523 medvedevs unilateral attempt to redraw the map marks a moment of real significance
8520524 it is not just the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe it is also the moment when countries are required to set out where they stand on the significant issues of nationhood and international law
8520525 over georgia russia has moved from support for territorial integrity to breaking up the country in three weeks and relied entirely on military force to do so in between it signed a ceasefire agreement which included international mediation as the way forward if her word is not her bond then she will not be trusted by anyone russia needs to ask itself about the relationship between short term military victories and longer term economic prosperity
8520526 the ministers were confident that the asean china fta free trade area remains a regional trading arrangement of some global significance given the magnitude of trade between the parties which accounted for 13 7 percent of global trade or almost half of asias total trade in 2007
8520527 the review reaffirmed the strong trade ties between the parties and the prospects for enhanced trade flows in the coming years as more tranches of tariff reductions come on stream

8520565 verpackungen die zu den privaten endverbrauchern gehen sind in zukunft verpflichtend bei dualen systemen zu lizenzieren das war der ansatz der bundesregierung und das ist auch das ergebnis
8520566 das ist der abf ller oder importeur der das abgef llte produkt in deutschland in verkehr bringt
8520567 das ist eine beauftragte wahrnehmung sie wirbt immer im namen des herstellers
8520568 das ganze ist zu testieren durch einen wirtschaftspr fer oder einen anderen qualifizierten sachverst ndigen und bei der zust ndigen industrie und handelskammer zu hinterlegen dann wird das beim dihk in einer datenbank zusammengefasst und im internet ver ffentlicht wer eine solche vollst ndigkeitserkl rung abgegeben hat die obliegenheit sich zu vergewissern dass die ware auch lizenziert ist liegt beim handel die entscheidende frage ist welche konkreten anforderungen fallen jetzt in dieser obliegenheit an und da ist es zun chst sicherlich notwendig dass man sich beim zulieferer erkundigt die erkundigung kann aus meiner sicht nicht darin bestehen dass man einmal telefoniert und sagt hast du lizenziert sie muss schon in einer schriftlichen best tigung in einer erkl rung liegen des erstinverkehrbringers also des abf llers gegen ber dem handel wenn es anlass gibt hier zweifel zu haben m sste man m glicherweise noch mehr verlangen als diese erkl rung das ist durchaus m glich es gibt den sachverst ndigen der eine vollst ndigkeitserkl rung abgibt und diesen beleg kann man sich zeigen lassen
8520569 wir kennen das doch aus der vergangenheit dass gerade die handelsunternehmen auch in ihre agbs geschrieben haben dass verpackungen zu lizenzieren sind bei dualen systemen dass auch st ndig nachgefragt wurde ob die verpackungen lizenziert wurden trotzdem haben wir 25 bis 30 prozent trittbrettfahrer das hei t wir haben in der vergangenheit eigentlich ein stumpfes schwert gehabt warum sollte jetzt dieses schwert sch rfer werden wenn ich auf die vollst ndigkeitserkl rung abstelle die quasi im folgejahr erst tats chlich stattfindet und beglaubigt wird dann wei ich nicht ob die ware die heute verkauft wird auch wirklich lizenziert ist da muss der handel bis zum n chsten jahr auf die vollst ndigkeitserkl rung warten zwischenzeitlich hat sich der handel schon bu geldpflichtig gemacht wenn f r die verkaufte ware keine lizenzierung erfolgt ist so wird eine situation geschaffen dass hier ein verpflichteter der im schadensfall sogar ein bu geld zahlen muss keine wirksamen kontrollm glichkeiten hat
8520570 das r cknahmesystem ist bisher dem prinzip der herstellerverantwortung gefolgt das hei t dass der hersteller die organisation und kostenverantwortlichkeit f r die r cknahme und verwertung bernimmt er gibt diese kosten dann ber die wertsch pfungskette letztlich an den verbraucher weiter thomas rummler vom bmu hat darauf hingewiesen dass der handel bei seinen eigenmarken die herstellerverantwortung bernimmt ich habe zweifel ob die rechtsauffassung des bmu haltbar ist dass die handelslizenzierung nach der novelle ausgeschlossen ist denn es kann aus meiner sicht nicht im raum stehen bleiben dass der handel bei pflichtverletzungen mit bu geldern belegt wird aber keine effizienten m glichkeiten hat die lizenzierung auch zu gew hrleisten
8520571 keiner wei was tats chlich bezahlt wird aber trotzdem bezahlt man im einkaufspreis die alten dsd geb hren und hat so keinerlei bersicht ob hier nicht eine margenerh hung stattfindet zugunsten der industrie

8520589 washington federal deposit insurance corp chairman sheila bair said tuesday her agency might have to borrow money from the treasury department to see it through an expected wave of bank failures
8520590 i would not rule out the possibility that at some point we may need to tap into short term lines of credit with the treasury for working capital not to cover our losses but just for short term liquidity purposes
8520591 why arent the premiums tied to a fixed of profits assets based on a regular risk assessment etc

8520595 manganese is an element found naturally in the body in addition the manganese in the nanobialys is tied up so it stays with the particles making them very safe
8520596 most nanoparticles are recognized by the bodys protective mechanisms which capture and remove them from the bloodstream within a few minutes
8520597 the reason these worms work so well is due to a combination of their shape and to a polymer coating on their surfaces that allows the nanoworms to evade these natural elimination processes as a result our nanoworms can circulate in the body of a mouse for many hours
8520598 the iron oxide used in the nanoworms has a property of superparamagnetism which makes them show up very brightly in mri
8520599 the magnetism of the individual iron oxide segments typically eight per nanoworm combine to provide a much larger signal than can be observed if the segments are separated this translates to a better ability to see smaller tumors hopefully enabling physicians to make their diagnosis of cancer at earlier stages of development
8520600 we are now using nanoworms to construct the next generation of smart tumor targeting nanodevices
8520601 in particular we have demonstrated that fnds are able to interact with plasmid dna and to deliver different genes into cultured human cells
8520602 as of now the consulate is looking after the survivors but soon they have to sort out their papers and take the first flight home about 42 workers have been given shelter at a labour accommodation located in al quoz we have also allocated some funds to them for their survival
8520603 a ziggurat was a temple tower of the ancient mesopotamian valley and iran having the form of a terraced pyramid of successively receding stories or levels some modern buildings with a step pyramid shape have also been termed ziggurats
8520604 other researchers have suggested in the past that nk cells might not always be good for you but we now have the first direct evidence that this can actually be the case
8520605 although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximize their beneficial role
8520606 yellowstone is located atop of one of the few large volcanic hotspots on earth
8520607 but though the hot material is a volcanic plume its cooler than others of its kind such as one in hawaii
8520608 although yellowstone sits above a plume of hot material coming up from deep with the earth its a remarkably lukewarm plume
8520609 it would be a mistake to write off yellowstone as a dead volcano a hot plume even a slightly cooler one is still hot
8520610 when patients go to the emergency room the doctors really cant help a lot the cocaine is still in their system
8520611 in the future we can look at these and other factors in women who quit smoking during pregnancy to assess who is at low or high risk of relapse we can then offer more intensive interventions for those at higher risk to address the physical behavioral and social issues related to relapse
8520612 but more needs to be done because over 50 percent of women who quit the habit during pregnancy are smoking again at six months postpartum
8520613 many of the women who relapsed were already trying to quit again when we interviewed them while there is no simple solution we recommend directly addressing the social and financial stresses that lead to relapse we hope that our study will encourage creative interventions to help mothers sustain a smoke free lifestyle after pregnancy improving overall health for women and their families

8520633 whilst the martu people have not yet had the opportunity to properly consider uranium mining on their lands we are not opposed to it in principle
8520634 we strongly believe that uranium mining could be an opportunity for our people to generate equity and commercial benefit and importantly play an important part in the development of significant resources projects for this state this is an important intergenerational issue for our people and its an issue that martu should be able to consider and make decisions about in an informed manner especially as a means of achieving economic and social outcomes for a group of people who continue to be under serviced by the state government
8520635 the western australian government has under serviced the martu people and most other indigenous people of this state for too long
8520636 there has been a great deal of mischievous scaremongering on the issue of uranium in wa and there will be serious long term consequences for indigenous people and wa as a whole
8520637 uranium and other mining companies will be reconsidering their plans to invest in wa today
8520638 this will clearly jeopardise was economic outlook and put at risk many agreements between prospective miners their future customers and the traditional land owners who depend on mining for their future
8520639 china will likely step up its copper buying in the fall and may well announce an economic stimulus package to counter g7 weakness

8520671 managers at bristol had succeeded in reversing the decline we recorded at the last inspection in 2005
8520672 however in spite of these efforts the effects of continued population pressure meant that bristol was not yet performing well enough in three crucial areas safety respect and activity
8520673 bristol is a busy local prison and works hard to provide a safe decent environment

8520677 the doctors said i have the early stages of pneumonia which a lot people probably have
8520678 these failures were a cause of the accident which resulted in the death of daniel burman
8520679 it hit the ground the impact had a catapult effect
8520680 burman fell out of his harness because he was not wearing it properly he fell approximately ten metres to the ground and died almost instantly
8520681 it would be to my knowledge the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in this jurisdiction and a significant penalty in the country for offences of this type

8520683 the ministers welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations between asean australia and new zealand
8520684 the ambassador outlined the russian federations position on recent developments in georgia
8520685 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8520686 mr smith stated that it would only be through dialogue and a cooperative approach that tensions in the region and internationally would be reduced and a long term resolution of the issue achieved
8520687 if you leave an emergency department overcrowded staffing ratios arent kept and elderly patients unfortunately will fall and its a risk
8520688 i have some suspicions and i know of a couple of cases of people who have actually fallen off trolleys but id like to follow it up and double check to make sure what actually happened to them long term
8520689 pressure areas occur people dont get fed properly and get sleep deprived because being in an emergency department our lights are on 24 hours a day seven days a week and they dont get good sleep
8520690 one of the ways that may be delivered is by dropping elective surgery in certain areas for a short period of time
8520691 theres been pressure for the last few weeks and we have been watching this with great concern
8520692 now it has reached absolute crisis point to the extent that the emergency medicine specialists are asking to use surgical beds too to make sure that patients actually receive the care they need
8520693 calculateb the shipping cost for this item by entering inbyour zipcode
8520694 establish that the accused was not entitled to the amounts that he claimed and received as the result of his dishonest conduct
8520695 it is incumbent on the prosecution to do this in order to establish to the necessary degree that the accused had an intent to defraud when he forged and uttered the documents in support of his claims
8520696 in the circumstances it is not necessary to make any finding as to whether or not the accused had an honest belief that he was entitled to claim as he did
8520697 for these reasons i conclude that while the accused acted dishonestly in making the claims that he did it has not been established that he did so with the necessary intent to defraud
8520698 accordingly in due course there will be a judgment of acquittal in respect of each of the charges
8520699 im very pleased its been a very significant toll on myself and my family

8520707 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8520708 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8520709 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8520710 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8520711 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8520712 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8520713 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8520714 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8520715 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8520718 yes we are better than most of the country but we are still concerned that our children are getting larger we are still in line with the rest of the uk in this respect last year a third of our youngsters were overweight or obese
8520719 for the first time ever this means there is a real chance of children dying before their parents we need to try and encourage everyone to take stock of their own lives think about the little things you can do to make a difference such as walking or running up stairs or going for a bike ride
8520720 its really about changing our culture it could take ten years but we need to reduce the reliance on fast food and ready meals and make sure everyone gets their five fruit and veg a day
8520721 we really need to keep an eye on our children theyre not necessarily overweight but we want to make sure they are living right there is proven evidence to show that obesity can cause all kinds of health problems in later years

8520879 es ist erfreulich dass eltern zunehmend technische hilfe in anspruch nehmen so wie wir sie in windows vista oder in dem mit der computerbild und anderen partnern vorgestellten kinderschutzprogramm anbieten sorgen macht mir allerdings das eltern insgesamt weniger zeit mit ihren kindern verbringen keine technik kann pers nlichen kontakt oder ein vertrauensvolles gespr ch ersetzen

8520888 why direct action why sit ins marches and so forth isnt negotiation a better path
8520889 why didnt you give the new city administration time to act
8520890 daddy why do white people treat colored people so mean
8520891 how can you advocate breaking some laws and obeying others
8520892 i agree with you in the goal you seek but i cannot agree with your methods of direct action
8520893 any christian knows that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry it has taken christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has the teachings of christ take time to come to earth
8520894 love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you
8520895 let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever flowing stream
8520896 i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus
8520897 here i stand i cannot do otherwise so help me god
8520898 i will stay in jail to the end of my days before i make a butchery of my conscience
8520899 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
8520900 follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the negro is your brother
8520901 those are social issues with which the gospel has no real concern
8520902 what kind of people worship here who is their god where were their god where were their voices when the lips of governor barnett dripped with words of interposition and nullification where were they when governor walleye gave a clarion call for defiance and hatred where were their voices of support when bruised and weary negro men and women decided to rise from the dark dungeons of complacency to the bright hills of creative protest
8520903 the last temptation is the greatest treason to do the right deed for the wrong reason
8520904 my feets is tired but my soul is at rest

8520906 if gardai are not authorised officers theres very little that can be done if there are bongo drummers in temple bar playing at 3am nothing can be done its one of those last resort issues if theres an alarm going off all weekend its fair to want it turned off
8520907 gardai cannot issue a fine and can only investigate if there is a breach of the peace the question is what are the legal and constitutional issues if there are too many constitutional issues it wont go ahead we will look to plug the gaps
8520908 there were no jobs available so we had no choice really but to accept the package
8520909 we were told at first that there could be jobs in some of ntrs other companies like greenstar then we were told that there would be jobs with eflow but neither of these things materialised
8520910 we really are annoyed about the way some of the staff have been treated most people in here have given over a decade of service to the company cork its all over the news but nobody seems to care too much about 120 toll bridge workers
8520911 the package we got was decent 10 weeks pay for every year we worked plus some shares too but next week we will be joining the dole queues
8520912 this has been on the cards for a while so its not a case of inviting the staff in one morning and telling them their jobs are gone
8520913 the workers have to get on with it theyve known about it for over a year
8520914 there was an initial sense that if new tolling companies were taking over and we had 120 tolling staff being let go then it made perfect sense for the staff to go there but unfortunately that never materialised because eflow located their call centre in newry instead
8520915 while the company regrets the redundancies circumstances made them unavoidable
8520916 the company kept employees fully informed from the time the government purchased the toll bridge
8520917 a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the bread which it has earned
8520918 with respect to the words general welfare i have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers enumerated in the constitution connected with them to take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators
8520919 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
8520920 i cannot find any authority in the constitution for public charity such spending would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the union of these states is founded
8520921 federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character
8520922 i feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan to indulge in benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public funds
8520923 we must always ask is government working to liberate and empower the individual is it creating incentives for people to produce save invest and profit from legitimate risks and honest toil is it encouraging all of us to reach for the stars or does it seek to compel command and coerce people into submission and dependence ask these questions because no matter where you look today you will see that development depends on economic freedom
8520924 ya nanti kita lihat dulu kesalahan dan lain lain tim sedang bekerja
8520925 kita lihat dulu kalau memang ada pemeriksaan kita umumkan dan kalau memang ada kesalahan pun akan kita umumkan pada masyarakat dan kesalahan akan kita koreksi
8520926 kalau itu upaya hukum dari para tersangka bukan kita lagi
8520927 saya didakwa dengan pasal 170 jo 55 dan pasal 156 tapi di sini saksi itu diperiksa untuk pasal 170 kuhp dan 151 kuhp jadi tidak ada kaitan dengan kasus saya
8520928 jpu seharusnya menghadirkan saksi yang bisa menceritakan dan menerangkan perbuatan terdakwa yaitu terdakwa menganjurkan untuk melakukan peyerangan
8520929 mekanismenya lewat rapimnas yang khusus untuk itu yang dihadiri seluruh delegasi istilahnya bukan konvensi tapi substansinya adalah konvensi seperti kemarin yang disempurnakan

8520934 dengan mas zaenal beliau bisa ambil segmen yang suka poligami karena di sana ada yang punya ayam bakar wong solo begitu dinamik karenanya saya kok nggak melihat itu daerah dapil neraka tapi justru dapil surga
8520935 kehadiran di sana bukan kemauan pribadi saya tapi perintah partai ini bukan untuk merebut kantong suara dari partai mana pun tapi untuk menyemarakkan demokrasi
8520936 kita nggak perlu malakukan black campaign kita tak perlu melakukan fitnah dan perilaku yang tidak sesuai dengan sifat wakil rakyat
8520937 di sana ada 8 kursi kita nggak boleh serakah demokrasi tak boleh memborong semua partai mentargetkan 2 kalau rakyat berikan lebih tentu kita tak bisa tolak

8520940 current findings involving simple organisms leave no doubt that lifespan is plastic
8520941 just imagine my last test appearance was in india in december sometimes it is frustrating how can a country go without a test match for eight months
8520942 the postponement of the australians tour to pakistan didnt help us at all but still we need more test matches otherwise we will not improve our position in icc rankings
8520943 there is too much stress on one day cricket these days while it is good to have international cricket and i would love to be part of it but i still want to be playing more test cricket
8520944 it has been a most frustrating injury but one of those things which one cant help i know in the past the pcb has not been very happy with the number of overs i bowled in a season for essex but this season i have been very careful with more support from other bowlers
8520945 the acquisition give us an immediate marketing distribution and sales presence in the highly profitable but regulated generic markets of uk and europe
8520946 with its profitable operations and immense market of opportunity this acquisition will be profitable from the beginning adding value to all stakeholders
8520947 this is our second acquisition in europe after bells amp sons and is significant milestone which will become one of the key drivers to marksans global growth strategy
8520948 we have already submitted written demands to the governors panel and are expecting a favourable response from them
8520949 though tension prevails the situation has been brought under control in 6 7 out of the 12 blocks of the district
8520950 persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages
8520951 the olympics has awarded something more valuable than the 51 gold medals it seized at the games
8520952 this can partially reflect the fact that the chinese nation has built confidence and as result become more tolerant
8520953 half of the world leaders gathered in beijing and enjoyed a diplomatic feast on the sidelines of the olympics the games has been used by these policy makers as a golden opportunity to extend goodwill to one another
8520954 chinas openness and transparency in information services during the the games
8520955 we have to be alert and denude the kapok trees to protect the green cover though it may sound paradoxical
8520956 now looking at the tough global environment we are into the next phase of transformation which is making our business from linear to non linear
8520957 more services making acquisitions to get platforms offering platform based services and more significantly we going to offer all this in as on demand service software as a service saas we just launched that because when you do that you completely delink revenues to headcount
8520958 my own sense is that the worst is behind us and in the second half there will be less and less impact
8520959 since the company is not a a position to do so now
8520960 there is a lack of safe platforms to talk about problems that give rise to violent behaviour including those relating to issues of gender and sexuality
8520961 initially i was asked by a number of boys if i was going to teach them how to have sex
8520962 the final assault was launched late last night by the special forces of the army and entire family of the house owner including four children was rescued
8520963 they have a great football team its not specific to any division they have a good football team
8520964 if an ad had seven home games he had met his budget
8520965 what is he going to do with the four nonconference games lets create a bowl atmosphere on the front side of the season thats a piece of turf we can own
8520966 its easier to do in the southeast because of driving distances
8520967 two hours outside of phoenix what you find is death by thirst
8520968 there are some programs out there that are willing to pay a lucrative amount
8520969 its market driven its economics if youre bringing in 95 000 into a home game youre making well over 3 to 4 million would you rather pay someone 1 million and make 2 to 3 million
8520970 he became a hero for my linemen when they heard he eats 8 000 to 10 000 calories a day
8520971 i asked them do you understand how much he works out if he puts away 10 000 calories a day
8520972 they say he didnt want to lose a race even in practice
8520973 was everybody else was breathing hard he just won the race and he looked like im ready to go again his conditioning was amazing
8520974 i think hes going to have some other things in his plans
8520975 with young guys you do a lot of teaching a lot of drill instruction fundamental work
8520976 tackle phil loadholt played in junior college last year was his first year of playing big time football hell be more confident for being in this environment the rest of these guys have been around here for four years it gives you some confidence they see things they see things coming they know what to look for
8520977 if we just spread people out and let the quarterback drop back and throw like the pros you could play a consistent defense but now youve got teams with two split receivers with runners and with quarterbacks who can run the option as well as throw this simply generates more offense than any defense can handle
8520978 war as they knew it woody hayes bo schembechler and america in a time of unrest
8520979 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time
8520980 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8520981 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8520982 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period
8520983 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care

8520998 russias decision has called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8520999 we deplore russias excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia

8521033 our core retirement living business achieved ebitda of 111 7 million which included revaluation uplifts of 61 5 million
8521034 the positive revaluations were largely driven by strong underlying performance growth and uplift in underlying economic exposure through upward revision of resident contract terms
8521035 this highlights the strength and quality of the underlying assets despite a difficult residential property environment
8521036 the agreement is designed to facilitate the price discovery process that bbc announced today as part of the strategic review process being carried out by the board of directors of bbc
8521037 todays agreement with bbc is in line with babcock amp browns commitment to narrow the focus of its activities
8521038 by late afternoon we expected it the loss when the polling stations closed at 5pm and each of them counted their votes around 5 45pm we already knew
8521039 we had unconfirmed results for about 14 counting centres and at first it was just a loss by 100 votes
8521040 then it became a lot so i called my husband and said you better not go to the main counting centre then dpm datuk seri najib abdul razak called to get him to attend a press conference instead at sunway hotel
8521041 we had realistic expectations but we never thought it would be by this much we thought we could stand a chance of losing but by less than 10 000
8521042 right from the beginning i was told that my battle was to reduce this majority but i was more than confident that it was possible to wrest away that seat
8521043 but it was not to be maybe theres something better waiting for me who knows
8521044 i thought that people were more concerned about the welfare of the state and their future but instead they subscribe to propaganda and promises of my opponent
8521045 i cant just tell everyone that we are prepared to lose we have to tell our supporters workers and party machinery that we can win this because if not nobody has the motivation to work
8521046 we were prepared to lose but we still want to carry out the fight no one should give up
8521047 when we go house to house maybe in front of you they can say they support but behind you they may mean ah go to heck

8521050 sememangnya sejak dari hari penamaan calon lagi sangat jelas anwar ibrahim akan menang mudah di situ
8521051 mengapa rakyat bersikap begitu kepada dacing yang dahulu menjadi simbol kepada anwar seharusnya diteliti semua pihak termasuk oleh bn sendiri
8521052 orang ramai berpusu pusu datang menimbulkan suasana yang cukup meriah yang tidak terdapat di dalam mana mana pilihan raya kecil yang pernah saya hadiri sebelum ini ia amat meriah
8521053 rakyat telah memberi isyarat jelas walaupun bn menggunakan segala jentera kerajaan dan swasta dalam kempenya serta mengguna taktik kotor dengan memburuk burukkan calon pakatan rakyat tetapi semua gagal menyakinkan pengundi
8521054 orang ramai sudah meluat setiap kali menonton berita melalui televisyen yang sarat dengan propaganda keterlaluan dan berat sebelah mereka mungkin mula beraleh kepada media alternatif
8521055 isu liwat yang dimainkan setiap hari oleh semua media kerajaan dan swasta sebagai bahan kempen bn sangat menjengkelkan orang ramai
8521056 not sure if this is or is not the norm but i just received my brand new iphone here in the uk and once it had been activated on itunes i found that the home screen the screen you can personalize with a photo already had a photo set against it
8521057 it would appear that someone on the production line was having a bit of fun has anyone else found this
8521058 i think its a kind of personal touch its nice maybe every phone that gets a full quality test should have its testers picture taken and left on there and the working conditions look pretty good
8521059 its going to be good in two days im sure
8521060 i was thinking more of it than i was really actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal
8521061 in that certain moment i felt big pain so i just had to tape the ankle but its going to be alright
8521062 according to standing order 4a 3 i wish to inform that from the feedback i have received i am satisfied that datuk seri anwar ibrahim mp for permatang pauh has received unanimous support from opposition members to be appointed opposition leader
8521063 i would like to congratulate him on his return to parliament and also his appointment as opposition leader
8521064 everyone wanted me to take an oath so its done
8521065 being denied of my rights although its been good that azizah has been holding the fort as mp for permatang pauh and opposition leader
8521066 i feel i am vindicated after all these personal attacks just to deny me at all cost anwar must not be allowed to return to parliament but the people of permatang pauh are wise enough to want to see me in parliament all their machination the might of those in authority the massive power and billions of dollars cannot alter the minds of malaysians
8521067 clearly the pm has lost the mandate and the deputy prime minister who spearheaded the campaign has been rejected outright its not just them but the entire umno and their cronies who have amassed billions from the people
8521068 i can assure you in our stated policy when umno is the opposition they will be given more right than when we were
8521069 thats normal for these nasty machinations of the bn government even after i have won they are still in a state of denial they use their henchmen in the media rtm and tv3 for example not just to broadcast malicious and scurrilous attacks but to deny even what is standard procedure
8521070 it is nothing personal i can meet them and be very civil its the umno leadership that has been dirty and personal we did not bring up any issue about their candidate in the by election shouldnt they feel shameful
8521071 we have been given a tentative date by ipl they want us to come to india on august 30 but i have replied to them that such a date wasnt possible
8521072 there are certain formalities to be completed before going to india to appear before the tribunal they should fix the date by middle of september
8521073 there was a deviation which has certain connotations which we cant divulge now but will do in due course of time the report from switzerland has just come in and we are analysing it the expert dr graham is going through the report

8521090 in no other country on earth is my story even possible
8521091 is a normal everyday average father and husband in a normal every day average family
8521092 john mccain has a great biography hes been a pow ive got a funny name
8521093 barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
8521094 his biography is attractive to young people but its also whys hes behind with seniors
8521095 i dont see him as being the celebrity that everybodys making him out to be
8521096 i was raised by a single parent as well my mother and turned out to be fairly successful
8521097 we want to open up the convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party
8521098 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8521099 hes going to lay out a case for change hes going to set the stakes of this election the risks of continuing down the road were on which is plainly what senator mccain is offering
8521100 and hes going to talk about an alternative path thats rooted in the best of what this country is and the kind of future we can build if we take it
8521101 his goal is to talk to the american people directly about the challenges that we face and what its going to take to solve them
8521102 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8521103 they should take a low profile their movements should be restricted during this period
8521104 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years
8521105 similarly if a sitting president suffers from such mental and psychological problems constitutionally he cannot retain his office
8521106 it was about the worst time of day for something like this to happen
8521107 were going to retime so it doesnt load at periods that could impact the system
8521108 a car hitting a phone pole should not take out a control center responsible for thousands of lives
8521109 if jonathan calder didnt exist wed probably have to invent him
8521110 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8521111 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8521112 however it turns out and however you feel about his candidacy
8521113 about america finally beginning to come to grips with the complexity of the racial issues that have bedeviled us for so long
8521114 this is a huge step this is a generational step
8521115 the word history gets thrown around and its used rather loosely
8521116 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it tonight
8521117 it was like watching muhammad ali come out of retirement
8521118 she was on the streets in korea when she was captured and brought to the state orphanage and in a way i can see from her perspective a very limited perspective that shes improved her situation for a little orphan kid from korea perhaps shes not to be blamed
8521119 javais pens tort que le gouvernement f d ral viendrait au secours de ceux qui restaient il ne la pas fait et nous nallons pas r p ter la m me erreur

8521121 these failures were a cause of the accident which resulted in the death of daniel burman
8521122 it hit the ground the impact had a catapult effect
8521123 burman fell out of his harness because he was not wearing it properly he fell approximately ten metres to the ground and died almost instantly
8521124 it would be to my knowledge the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in this jurisdiction and a significant penalty in the country for offences of this type
8521125 i expect that these breaches of the act are not at the top of the range nevertheless they are serious matters
8521126 the ministers welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations between asean australia and new zealand
8521127 establish that the accused was not entitled to the amounts that he claimed and received as the result of his dishonest conduct
8521128 it is incumbent on the prosecution to do this in order to establish to the necessary degree that the accused had an intent to defraud when he forged and uttered the documents in support of his claims
8521129 in the circumstances it is not necessary to make any finding as to whether or not the accused had an honest belief that he was entitled to claim as he did
8521130 for these reasons i conclude that while the accused acted dishonestly in making the claims that he did it has not been established that he did so with the necessary intent to defraud
8521131 accordingly in due course there will be a judgment of acquittal in respect of each of the charges
8521132 im very pleased its been a very significant toll on myself and my family
8521133 its cost me a million dollars in financial costs and an unbelievable toll in personal and psychological costs
8521134 theyre worried about health care retirement and how theyll sustain their lifestyle
8521135 ive always wanted to live above my means because it inspired me to work harder
8521136 people who are serious about building wealth always want to have a mortgage

8521142 the ambassador outlined the russian federations position on recent developments in georgia
8521143 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8521144 mr smith stated that it would only be through dialogue and a cooperative approach that tensions in the region and internationally would be reduced and a long term resolution of the issue achieved
8521145 if you leave an emergency department overcrowded staffing ratios arent kept and elderly patients unfortunately will fall and its a risk
8521146 i have some suspicions and i know of a couple of cases of people who have actually fallen off trolleys but id like to follow it up and double check to make sure what actually happened to them long term
8521147 pressure areas occur people dont get fed properly and get sleep deprived because being in an emergency department our lights are on 24 hours a day seven days a week and they dont get good sleep
8521148 one of the ways that may be delivered is by dropping elective surgery in certain areas for a short period of time
8521149 theres been pressure for the last few weeks and we have been watching this with great concern
8521150 now it has reached absolute crisis point to the extent that the emergency medicine specialists are asking to use surgical beds too to make sure that patients actually receive the care they need

8521165 michael costa has condemned his privatisation to a cowards death

8521171 in light of the trying times that the airline sector is currently experiencing as a result of the tremendous increase in fuel costs we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year more particularly because it has been demonstrated that our broad based business model is well positioned to overcome these challenges
8521172 despite all the challenges stemming from the weakening global economy and the explosive development of kerosene prices we remain optimistic about achieving a positive operating income for the current year

8521193 viola la integridad territorial y la soberan a de georgia y es contario a las resoluciones del consejo de seguridad de la onu apoyadas por rusia
8521194 pone en duda su compromiso con la paz y la seguridad en el c ucaso
8521195 nuestro pa s es menos seguro y est m s aislado ahora que en ning n otro momento en la historia reciente
8521196 pone de relieve el estancamiento de una econom a que se encuentra al borde de la recesi n
8521197 ser a muy malo que el gobierno pasara de negar la evidencia a aceptar pasivamente que nos esperan un par de trimestres negativos por lo que creemos que el ejecutivo puede y debe adoptar numerosas iniciativas para incentivar el consumo y la inversi n dos de las bases de la recuperaci n de la econom a
8521198 ya no refleja ninguna ventaja con respecto a la media europea est decididamente a la baja y es muy probable que siga as al menos en lo que queda de a o
8521199 insiste en su optimismo antropol gico y pretende que en cuanto se clarifique la coyuntura internacional la econom a espa ola recuperar una tasa de crecimiento potencial del orden del 3
8521200 no es probable que as ocurra el potencial de crecimiento de la econom a espa ola del a o 2008 anda mucho m s cerca del estancamiento
8521201 habr que tomar muchas m s medidas de las adoptadas hasta ahora y asumir ajustes hasta recuperar el crecimiento del 3
8521202 no reconoce o no quiere reconocer esa segunda parte del problema mientras no lo haga no estar en condiciones de asumir la situaci n e intentar remediarla
8521203 ni el gobierno propone medidas serias de austeridad ni los agentes sociales asumen la crisis porque echan balones fuera
8521204 insiste en pintar un cuadro catastr fico tan lejano de la realidad como el triunfalismo socialista hasta hace pocas fechas
8521205 no deber a parapetarse en europa para justificar su inactividad
8521206 se equivoca al atribuir la crisis s lo a zapatero y reincidir en el catastrofismo
8521207 no acert cuando en julio subi el tipo de inter s al 4 25 pese al estancamiento
8521208 deber a hacer reflexionar al gobierno sobre la necesidad de aprovechar el cambio de tendencia y de reforzarlo al m ximo
8521209 escudarse en lo ajeno para justificar los fracasos propios es de mal gobernante
8521210 no es verdad que la econom a espa ola est mejor que la europea
8521211 es comprensible que el gobierno trate de restar dramatismo pero echar balones fuera revela su impotencia para hacer frente al desplome con las armas que tiene a su disposici n
8521212 urgen a que el gobierno agilice la obra p blica prevista y ponga en marcha aquellas medidas que puedan aliviar al sector sin sostenerlo artificialmente
8521213 una reprochable y perjudicial tendencia a trivializar la vulnerabilidad que presenta nuestro modelo de crecimiento
8521214 afronta el nuevo curso con la responsabilidad de acertar en las iniciativas dise adas para reaccionar ante la crisis y obligado a sacar adelante unos presupuestos capaces de responder a las exigencias de una coyuntura tan desfavorable

8521217 que no se puede tachar de oportunista porque ya la present ante el parlamento en 2005 y en 2007
8521218 debe apoyar la propuesta porque encaja con una demanda social tanto de respuestas pol ticas ante una cat strofe como de tranquilidad para el transporte a reo en todas las vertientes de su seguridad
8521219 tiene la obligaci n de realizar una investigaci n exhaustiva para saber si se produjeron o no fallos y negligencias

8521223 una derrota para rajoy que pone a prueba en galicia su nueva estrategia de apertura al di logo y disponibilidad para pactar con los nacionalistas
8521224 supone admitir que las cosas van a ir a peor y que la crisis es mayor de lo que acepta el gobierno
8521225 en espa a se deber an implementar incentivos fiscales m s atractivos para quienes optan por no jubilarse lo que adem s permitir a al tejido productivo seguir benefici ndose de su experiencia

8521303 you get to see the tradition and everything from the outside but from the inside you really get to see that there are some really good people involved in that program
8521304 he was the most impressive strength and conditioning coach ive seen hes very outside the box they dont just do ordinary lifting and that really impressed me
8521305 barwis stripped him down to 240 and built him up back to 270 then he could bench 400 or something like that that was just in five months if you make those kinds of gains you are obviously doing something right
8521306 he seems like hes really turning the michigan program in a new direction with the people hes brought in the new trainer and new coaches i think hes a really good coach
8521307 it was interesting for me because as a kid i was a michigan fan
8521308 i grew up in grand rapids i have followed the history of michigan football probably the biggest thing i took away from it was their innovation and the new way of operating not that the old way wasnt successful because it was very successful but it was a lot of energy a lot of new ideas and bringing a new kind of game to michigan it just seemed very intriguing and very refreshing
8521309 what has been a little bit of a challenge in this whole recruiting thing is that craig really started with a total clean slate
8521310 there wasnt any school that he thought boy if they just offered me a scholarship i would go there to tell you the truth craig really never developed any kind of real allegiance to any college
8521311 what i really didnt realize is how different some college programs can be i thought that when you go into division i football it is the same at every place but a lot of people take a lot of different approaches and come out with different results
8521312 really what i am looking for is the game environment and if i can gel with the players if i can get along with the kind of people down in michigan
8521313 its academics the history of the school where the school is going where i fit into the scheme
8521314 a lot of people see it as to taking what the school gives to you but i think that i should be contributing to the school whatever school allows me to do that the most will be my choice
8521315 im just a freshman i dont know what to expect just taking baby steps
8521316 you just do the best you can with what you got
8521317 it affects my whole life from talking to people to practice to class everything
8521318 i dont mean to do it but sometimes i have to
8521319 i didnt think i needed to say anything at that point
8521320 i dont mind this is a family and these are my brothers
8521321 coach treats me like anyone else but he knows i have some limitations
8521322 i might need a break here and there if i dont understand a call
8521323 hes driven and showing why hes the no 1 tight end at michigan state
8521324 charlie is a wonderful kid and will do anything he can to get better
8521325 hes always been one of those kids that made you say theres something different something really special about him
8521326 was trevor youre not going to be able to do this
8521327 my mom always told me if you do schoolwork like you do football youd be a 4 0 student
8521328 i took that attitude toward it i put the important things in perspective i made the things that were important more important i took it as a challenge
8521329 a lot of it is because of what he knows and what he brings to our defense im looking for big things out of trevor hes a michigan kid and hes always wanted to be here at michigan state
8521330 trevor is like a son hes a guy who i have always admired as a young man if you could let your daughter date someone he would be the guy or he would be a guy to come over and baby sit your kids i respect him hes come a long way hes a guy you can count on
8521331 michigan state is the best kept secret in the big ten
8521332 but with 13 seniors were not a veteran team if you look down at ohio state they have 20 plus seniors the leadership has to come from not only those seniors but from younger players
8521333 we have experience we played a lot of people last year so that should carry us through
8521334 i like where were at i like the attitude of our football team i always have our guys work from my standpoint theyre all in theyre all invested
8521335 that goes a long way hes got a great arm hes got presence he knows the offense well when he makes mistakes he knows what he did wrong hes always been a guy who studies the game you can see him taking charge out there
8521336 hes going to touch the ball a lot in different ways
8521337 i dont expect any freshman to do what he did
8521338 but with his instincts it doesnt shock me after you watch how he can do it
8521339 were going to continually try to get the guys who can make plays on the field at once
8521340 i expect to have a better season than i did last year we may be young but it can be a great defense
8521341 im not just going to get mad ah man theyre talking about our team we all know preseason really doesnt mean anything the end result is what really counts so thats what were working on
8521342 i think we are going to shock a lot of people this year
8521343 because the game plan the schemes everything being people dont really know what we really are going to do right now so a lot of people are going to be shocked a lot of people dont think we have as much talent as we usually have in the past but i see it
8521344 i think our players feel a little bit of that chip on their shoulder because everyone is writing them off
8521345 i want guys who think hey ive got to go out here and prove i can play because weve got a lot of proving to do
8521346 we want to have our guys have a sense of urgency to compete successfully right away our goal every year is to going to be to compete for a big ten championship i dont want to wait to say next years team or 2010 guys our goal this year is to compete for a championship thats our mindset going in
8521347 we have a sense of urgency theres no this is a rebuilding year we want to do it now and coach rod understands that weve got to do it now theres no time to rebuild we have to go after it
8521348 i would say that because we have more veteran players on defense players who have been there before who have been through the games through the battles
8521349 i always want the game to be on us to depend on us
8521350 its a six to eight week thing so obviously its long term
8521351 now whether he can play again toward the end of the year we just have to wait and see how his knee responds to it
8521352 you wont see him there much if carlos guillen is healthy
8521353 hell make the routine play but he wont make great plays
8521354 but he was called up because our third baseman is out and this is the time to take a look at him
8521355 this is an interesting guy but what am i going to learn in four innings i dont know i just think i should be there he chose to sign with us its respectful to be there
8521356 i wont talk to him ill just go down there with a couple of coaches and watch from the press box dont read anything into it though other than were trying to find out if he can be a big league pitcher again
8521357 hell remain with the club the rest of the year after tuesday
8521358 but i cant guarantee hell be starting the rest of the year
8521359 ive never beaten michigan i do not want to go through my whole college career without beating my rival school that would be embarrassing
8521360 a lot of people are saying michigan is basically going through a rebuilding stage weve not being na ve about that were not listening to that its michigan they still have a lot of great players
8521361 the network music player will be the cd player of the 21st century and squeezebox boom is the first player in its class to deliver high quality audio in a compact all in one design

8521369 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8521370 vote for obama because hes the second coming of me in 1992
8521371 not when you spend even a moment remembering anything clinton had to say about
8521372 i actually think its inevitable twenty20 cricket will be an olympic sport
8521373 you think about the audiences in the sub continent 22 or 23 per cent of the worlds population is based in that area
8521374 the ioc could do a lot worse than put cricket into the olympics
8521375 the critical issue with the game of twenty20 cricket is how do we make it work
8521376 the reason i say that is not because i want to go off and play its not about that
8521377 i want to play for australia as much as i can i want to play as many tests for australia as i can
8521378 i want the next generation of australian players to have that dream to put on the baggy green cap and play 100 test matches and 300 one day games
8521379 im worried if theres not that period of time be it in the ipl or the epl or whatever competition it might be that this next generations opinions might change
8521380 they might see the dollars and think maybe its more appealing to me that i go and play ipl instead of playing for my country
8521381 i am really excited about the opportunity to play some county cricket
8521382 i am looking forward to getting out there today and performing

8521410 its not a real gundam if you cant call it by a letter
8521411 i want everybody to now understand why i am so proud to have joe biden and the whole biden family
8521412 i think hes presented himself pretty well so far what do you think
8521413 i know it you know it barack obama gets it
8521414 this is the time as americans together we get back up
8521415 these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready barack obama is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time
8521416 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8521417 ive been on the ground in georgia iraq pakistan and afghanistan and i can tell you in no uncertain terms this administrations policy has been an abject failure
8521418 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8521419 and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8521420 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8521421 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8521422 after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home
8521423 be there because barack obama and joe biden will deliver america the change we so desperately need
8521424 i do know that 25 000 marines in a province again are probably in excess of the need especially after iraqi provincial control assumes responsibilities for security
8521425 the taliban are growing bolder in their tactics and clearly doing their best to exploit security gaps where they exist
8521426 weve seen families slaughtered weve seen policemen rounded up and executed with shots to the back of the head in the soccer stadium just to make the point and so thats what we risk if we dont somehow take advantage of those gains and maintain the momentum in that area

8521458 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can change the change that everybody knows we need barack obama is going to deliver that change
8521459 everything i learnt in my eight years of president and every work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me barack obama is the man for this job
8521460 lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8521467 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8521468 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8521469 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8521470 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8521471 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8521472 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8521473 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8521484 the seasonally weaker first half has been marked by extremely difficult market conditions in the form of unprecedented fuel costs slowing economic growth in our main markets and a weakness in dollar and sterling
8521485 fuel is the most significant cost within the business and the 56 5 million increase in our first half fuel costs contributed significantly to a loss of 22 3 million the company has 70 per cent of its estimated fuel requirement for the remaining four months of 2008 hedged at a rate of 1 137 per tonne and a 20 per cent of its 2009 requirement hedged at a rate of 1 165 per tonne
8521486 even with the reduction in fuel prices over the last few weeks competitive pressure on fares and volumes will continue and we are at best expected to break even in the second half delivering a loss for the full year
8521487 recent activity levels in the housing market have been very subdued

8521512 hes an impact player a difference maker you just kept your fingers crossed that he was going to be able to play but i think in the back of all our minds knowing shawne we know what was in his heart and that he really wanted to play and that any cost possible he was going to find a way to get out there on that field
8521513 its not a decision of anything else but me wanting to play football and whether thats a good decision or not im going to go out and try first to see what i want to do
8521514 it is something he has put an awful lot of time into and we are going to manage it and hope he can manage it and be ready to play
8521515 we are not going to put him on the field if hes not able to go out and perform and he is not going to want to be out there if he doesnt feel like he can perform

8521529 la mancanza di alberghi a mosca di cui era tanto di moda parlare 10 anni fa e solo un mito gli alberghi sono sufficienti ma sono tutti cari quelli economici in estate sono strapieni

8521531 as an ardent practicing catholic abortion is an issue that i have studied for a long time
8521532 since it must be treated from conception as a person the embryo must be defended in its integrity cared for and healed as far as possible like any other human being
8521533 i understand and this is like maybe 50 years or something like that so again over the history of the church this is an issue of controversy
8521534 the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8521535 fetch option for my other mails like gmail and mobile me turned to manual that means it will only update when i click on the mail app or the particular inbox while this might not work for everyone it might be useful to have the fetch mail in the imap accounts as less frequently as possible
8521536 we cant continue to have the same tired plays being run from the same tired playbook
8521537 anyone who achieves success in a billion dollar campaign has achieved something significant
8521538 people do like to give to success once an institution has demonstrated it has used the funds it raised wisely people will give again
8521539 we have much to be proud of and much to be grateful for
8521540 things like cancer research and pediatric medicine are causes close to donors hearts

8521542 i have done what i thought was right to protect the safety of the public on our highways

8521544 we can get no documentation that says anything that has occurred in the past has proven to us that it is dangerous
8521545 these guys are supposed to be on the same side and on a relatively non controversial piece of legislation easley becomes the first governor to have a veto overridden in north carolina history
8521546 were making an exclusion for a small group of people
8521547 when the u s department of defense wants to transport equipment over 8 feet wide they have to apply for a permit when the forest service wants to move bulldozers and equipment to work in areas throughout the state they have to apply for permits just like any agency or any business
8521548 i felt like today the governor saw a mistake that we made by voting for this
8521549 a lot of people try to bring boats that have no business being trailered down these narrow highways to the outer banks
8521550 ive been doing this for 30 years and never had an accident
8521551 one reason we dont have accidents is that when youre towing something like that you know youve got something big behind you and youre more careful going down the road
8521552 this was an odd piece of legislation for the governor to stand on but after the past eight years im not surprised
8521553 this is the most expensive governor initiated session of his term
8521554 we have bridges in north carolina where two cars cant cross at the same time

8521560 it was a great win for us and the program it got us some national standing because everybody was saying whos n c state we were total underdogs but we ended up winning
8521561 its hard not to think hey im a rock star man
8521562 it was years we needed a home and away and it worked out for south carolina too coming out of the box you kind of remember those opening thursday night games throughout the year
8521563 its different when youre training during the summer and youre preparing for a high profile team like that
8521564 you work a little bit harder you push a little bit more so you can prepare yourself for that team
8521565 well work through the multiyear plan with the parameters we have at the time
8521566 were elated and pleased that the court is affirming what weve said that parental choice does matter
8521567 weve seen some pretty egregious examples that dont fit a misdemeanor
8521568 we want to make sure that we dont make it so hostile to potential candidates that we cant get people to run for office
8521569 and we also want to make sure we dont create felony penalties for everything so that weve got so many in prison for campaign finance violations that we dont have room for people who commit violent crimes
8521570 the indictments and convictions will continue until either the leadership of the general assembly decides to change the culture of the institution or voters adopt a throw the bums out mentality
8521571 i dont think its in the states interests to extend the time of his incarceration
8521572 it was impossible to win based on the instructions the jury was given
8521573 i hated to but he needs to understand its in poor taste
8521574 we might think raleigh is greater than charlotte but thats not cool

8521592 if youre invested in something then you respond to adversity
8521593 if youre not invested then theres nothing to respond to because youre not invested my guess would be that the reason were still so positive and were going to have a great year is because theres a lot of invested players theyre older and more mature its not the same as it was last year

8521704 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8521705 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8521706 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8521707 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8521758 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8521759 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8521760 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be the president of the united states
8521761 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8521762 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8521763 barack obama and i took very different journeys to this destination but we share a common story
8521764 mine began in scranton pennsylvania and then wilmington delaware with a dad who fell on hard economic times but who always told me champ when you get knocked down get up get up my mothers creed is the american creed no one is better than you you are everyones equal and everyone is equal to you
8521765 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure
8521766 you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart i watched how he touched people how he inspired them and i realized he has tapped into the oldest american belief of all we dont have to accept a situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it
8521767 i mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the senate before he started running he would have been a senator longer by the time hes inaugurated but essentially once you start running for president full time you dont have time to do much else
8521768 no matter whwere we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8521769 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8521770 our position in the world has been weakened by too much unilateralism and too little cooperation
8521771 in some way the mccain people would love to see this as a repeat of reagan versus carter in 1980 where reagan got to run as the candidate of america and carter was the candidate of complexity and no answers
8521772 iran cuba venezuela these countries are tiny compared to the soviet union
8521773 another dishonest and desperate attack that bears zero relationship to reality
8521774 toxic and dangerous effects of a neocon unilateralist style that has nearly shattered our alliances and made americans weaker
8521775 i dont think it has the same resonance and intellectual honesty that it had in an earlier era
8521776 the public feels the republicans have been quite reckless on these things
8521777 the odds are pretty high we wont get to 60 but its not out of the question
8521778 the chatter about whether democrats can pick up enough seats in november to hit the magic number of 60 and a filibuster proof majority is getting louder
8521779 its not as good as 60 but its close enough to get a lot done
8521780 no accident they hired howard wolfson used him in some sort of little toy soldier waiting on the shelf
8521781 tokyo rose was the thought that came to my mind
8521782 im not going to take any lecturing on how to be a good democrat from two people who spent the last two years relentlessly attacking bill and hillary clinton every day
8521783 i think its unfortunate that a news organization with a great tradition like nbc has been taken over by this kind of antics
8521784 i had let a couple of previous attacks pass but at some point you need to stand up to bullies
8521785 keith is too important to be constrained restrained might be a different matter by facts he is the heir to huntley to brinkley to chancellor to brokaw sorry nbc keith thinks democrats shouldnt deign to appear on fox
8521786 john moody is a hysterical doctrinaire right wing hack propagandist who conveniently forgets that when he thought i shared his allegiance to his dark view of the world tried to hire me for fox news
8521787 as for mr wolfson i feel very sorry for the choices he made that led him to his sad state
8521788 reports of strong support within john mccains presidential campaign for independent democratic sen
8521789 but they cant get away with it and this has been made clear to mccain by none other than joe lieberman himself
8521790 lieberman surely doesnt know that much about republican politics but he has close republican friends one of them prevailed on lieberman to tell mccain that a mccain lieberman ticket would be a disaster for all concerned and especially for the gop
8521791 barack obama said he plans to focus on the struggles of middle class americans including their tax burden in his thursday night speech accepting the democratic nomination for president
8521792 barack obama whose oratory and opposition to the war in iraq helped propel him to the democratic presidential nomination said thursday that hes preparing for an election he believes will turn on the economy
8521793 you havent worked so hard over the last 18 months or endured the last eight years to suffer through more failed leadership
8521794 no way no how no mccain barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8521795 one hundred years later the negro is still languishing in the corners of american society
8521796 what this shows is that everyone has the same opportunity here
8521797 hopefully will mean that weve crossed a bridge into a time when race doesnt matter
8521798 i think theres still a lot of latent racism among all of us but i think its a hopeful hopeful sign
8521799 people are going to look at him obama and say maybe i can run for office for any office
8521800 i think its a mistake on the part of a company to think that simply because they enroll that they are going to be protected from any kind of government audit or raid
8521801 howard industries runs every check allowed to ascertain the immigration status of all applicants for jobs it is company policy that it hires only u s citizens and legal immigrants
8521802 have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of power
8521803 they actually want us to reward them for the last eight years by giving them four more
8521804 lets send them a message that will echo from the rockies all across america thanks but no thanks in this case the third time is not the charm
8521805 saying i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8521806 we are proud to have passed the most aggressive and innovative energy platform in republican party history
8521807 increasing americas energy independence is an issue of critical importance to our nation and its an issue on which john mccain has demonstrated strong and continued leadership with his all of the above approach
8521808 the same human activity that has brought freedom and opportunity to billions has also increased the amount of carbon in the atmosphere
8521809 increased atmospheric carbon has a warming effect on the earth
8521810 once hes elected hes going to have to spend a whole lot of time with the speaker nancys influence is not going to be surpassed by any event or any person
8521811 i have in my brain an idea that democrats are going to be in the majority for a while so get used to it
8521812 it is going to be a time of positive constructive change
8521813 i talk about it because our sense of pride gives hope for other individuals too that kind of hope and pride inspires other people into action
8521814 for those who do not want to have that dialogue i recognize that but for those of us who are proud of this moment we are not going to squash that
8521815 if she were alive she would be immensely proud of my being the first african american mayor of columbus
8521816 but she would not have even conceived of the possibility that a black man or woman a person of color could become president of these united states of america
8521817 you dont run from your roots you embrace your past and you represent everybody
8521818 i couldnt believe what i was seeing now for me to be here
8521819 but with older people theres no way if you were born in my time and world to think that you would see this happen
8521820 there were certain things we knew we couldnt do you could have the second best grades but you knew when you were pushing up to the line and crossing over it
8521821 there are some people here that are afraid this may in some way take away from their status but this is not a black thing or a white thing
8521822 there are some majority people who are afraid of that but if were not all rowing in the same rhythm were going to go in a circle
8521823 being an african american and not being sensitive to the historic nature of this is just a fallacy
8521824 ive always been involved in politics but i always had to settle for this is the first time in my adult life ive been really excited this is going to show that americas precepts are not just rhetoric
8521825 its not so much that hes black thats why it is historic but thats not why people are excited whats exciting is that he is transcending
8521826 just looking at those numbers its way too early to call the race
8521827 were not going to finish counting absentee and provisional ballots until september 5th
8521828 senator biden agreed that barack obama was unprepared to be president
8521829 i think hillary clinton called it naive senator biden called it irresponsible
8521830 what we dont know is if she thinks hes qualified to be commander in chief
8521831 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far dont you think
8521832 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8521833 i am here for everyone i grew up with in scranton and wilmington
8521834 i am here for the cops and firefighters the teachers and assembly line workers the folks whose lives are the very measure of whether the american dream endures
8521835 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8521836 folks remember when the world used to trust us when they looked to us for leadership with barack obama as our president theyll look to us again theyll trust us again and well be able to lead again
8521837 i feel weirdly more comfortable and relaxed when im out of the studio which is a sanitized environment
8521838 tell him to give me a quick call tell him not to forget the little people
8521839 i feel weirdly more comfortable and relaxed when im out of the studio which is a sanitized environment
8521840 you pick up on the energy of your surroundings its much more like my old job i can really loosen up
8521841 a crazy media spin cycle that was sort of surreal to watch
8521842 the perfect vehicle for her to spread her wings a little bit
8521843 you can talk all you want about policies and programs but thats not what people respond to
8521844 people respond when they are touched emotionally and thats what hes so good at its going to be very important in his speech tomorrow night that people get excited emotionally thats what they want from him
8521845 the next leg of the journey for women had to be focused on economic security
8521846 you didnt even think about it you didnt talk about it
8521847 people were struggling struggling for the right to vote to end segregation in many parts of the american south people were so afraid they were afraid to be afraid
8521848 as the drama of the primary unfolded more and more what barack obamas campaign did and what it was saying to the country and to me personally was so akin to the movement
8521849 the revolution is at hand and we must free ourselves of the chains of political and economic slavery
8521850 to those who have said be patient and wait we must say that patience is a dirty and nasty word we cannot be patient we do not want to be free gradually we want our freedom and we want it now we cannot depend on any political party for both the democrats and the republicans have betrayed the basic principles of the declaration of independence
8521851 first of all i think shes so smart so gifted but shes also been a wonderful friend along with her husband theyve been like family and i thought she would make a great president
8521852 some people think barack obama just appeared on the scene overnight but it was a movement a struggle that produced this man that created a climate for this personality to emerge
8521853 in him is the embodiment of the hopes and dreams and aspirations and suffering of so many people people say hes not of the civil rights movement but hes a byproduct of that movement and theres no way you can forget that
8521854 a father knows hes a success when he turns and looks at his son or daughter and know that they turned out better than he did
8521855 champ when you get knocked down get up get up

8521869 would take some years for new zealand to get over
8521870 the serious fraud office is independent from government and treats a minister of the crown just like a private citizen and not above the law
8521871 i want to emphasise that it is entirely possible that there are innocent and honest explanations the use of statutory power to require documents to be provided will enable the sfo to ascertain how funds were applied
8521872 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8521873 the allegations concern important matters relating to the funding of a political party which go to the heart of the democratic process and involve a minister in the government

8521902 would you please give me some salt id like to put it in my coffee
8521903 when i was a little boy i was living near the sea i like playing in the sea i could feel the taste of the sea just like the taste of the salty coffee now every time i have the salty coffee i think of my childhood think of my hometown i miss my hometown so much i miss my parents who are still living there
8521904 my dearest please forgive me forgive my lie this was the only lie i said to you the salty coffee remember the first time we dated i was so nervous at that time actually i wanted some sugar but i said salt it was hard for me to change so i just went ahead i never thought that could be the start of our communication i tried to tell you the truth many times in my life but i was too afraid to do that as i have promised not to lie to you for anything now im dying i afraid of nothing so i tell you the truth i dont like the salty coffee what a strange bad taste but i have had the salty coffee for my whole life since i knew you i never feel sorry for anything i do for you having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life if i can live for the second time still want to know you and have you for my whole life even though i have to drink the salty coffee again

8521912 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
8521913 they know that hillary clinton is supporting barack obama as are most of her supporters
8521914 at a fundraiser in san francisco ca sen barack obama d ill claimed he had more world experience than his rivals sens john mccain r ariz and hillary clinton d n y and introduced a new bit of biographical information
8521915 foreign policy is the area where i am probably most confident that i know more and understand the world better than senator clinton or senator mccain
8521916 its ironic because this is supposedly the place where experience is most needed to be commander in chief experience in washington is not knowledge of the world this i know when senator clinton brags ive met leaders from eighty countries i know what those trips are like ive been on them you go from the airport to the embassy theres a group of children who do native dance you meet with the cia station chief and the embassy and they give you a briefing you go take a tour of a plant that with the assistance of usaid has started something and then you go
8521917 you dont know those eighty countries so when i speak about having lived in indonesia for four years having family that is impoverished in small villages in africa knowing the leaders is not important what i know is the people i traveled to pakistan when i was in college i knew what sunni and shia was sic before i joined the senate foreign relations committee
8521918 its not the people who vote that count its the people who count the votes
8521919 2002 october 15 iraq stages a mock democratic presidential election in which there are no other candidates than saddam hussein and all ballots are shown to election officials before being cast and counted by regime officials the election shows 100 of all votes for saddam and a 100 turn out

8521923 ni siquiera ahora quiero acordarme de los que vaticinaron lo que hoy descartamos en el valencia hacen falta hombres con valor en el campo y respeto por la afici n como es david
8521924 es un mensaje claro y rotundo para el resto del mundo del f tbol y algunos de sus dirigentes el valencia no se va a dejar intimidar por nadie con el valencia se va de frente y con las cartas encima de la mesa no aceptamos otra forma de actuar
8521925 lo que no me han gustado son las formas del real madrid
8521926 yo cuando quiero fichar a alguien voy de cara y directo
8521927 no lo entiendo es una hip tesis que existi estuve el domingo en el gran premio de f rmula 1 y un emisario del valencia me ofreci a villa por 80 millones cuando jug el valencia aqu le dije si realmente le quer a vender y me dijo que por un precio muy alto eso es todo
8521928 durante el ltimo mes y medio han sucedido muchas cosas en mi cabeza y en mi entorno cosas que no hab a vivido antes y para las que no sab a si estaba preparado
8521929 si estoy aqu es porque estoy convencido si me quieren fichar deben negociar con el valencia porque yo estoy a gusto aqu no he visto posibilidad alguna de salir
8521930 he de agradecer al valencia el gesto que ha hecho por
8521931 i am going to push like the devil if they india get their end done i am an optimist i am not going to say it the congressional clock has run out
8521932 my dream is that in 2020 the two closest nations in the world will be india and the united states
8521933 i am so delighted because there cannot be a better person than him in terms of foreign policy experience and credentials for the betterment of us india relations
8521934 and biden is the kind of guy whatever he speaks it comes from the heart he does not mince words and he says what he believes in so i believe this is a dream ticket
8521935 i was the only indian american who was with him from the very beginning and we have maintained our friendship ever since
8521936 so i am now going to put every effort of mine to get this dream ticket elected to the white house
8521937 the whole idea of picking biden the way i see it a guy with so much foreign policy expertise and gravitas should now take care of the critics who argue that obama doesnt have any foreign policy experience with everything thats happening in georgia and around the world nobody can question this ticket and this team now
8521938 so for us india relations and for obamas perceived weakness in foreign policy and to complement that weakness perception there cannot be a better person than biden
8521939 i agree it is an irony of course and he is certainly going to be very busy so well have to work very hard with his staff and other supporters of the deal to make it go through the congress when it comes back from the nsg
8521940 we have to make sure that biden makes clear to them that they have to deliver on it even if he doesnt have the time to work on pushing it through but i am concerned
8521941 i am hoping to see him here because there are a lot of events with him and i hope to talk to him we have to see how we can change our strategy and make it work
8521942 ive been a longtime fan of joe biden i worked on the senate foreign relations committee when he was a member and i was a deputy staff director i have followed him for a very long time and hes exactly what i think obama needed in terms of completing his ticket with a clear expert and experienced practitioner in foreign affairs thats where i believe this is going to be a big help
8521943 so it was a great choice and he brings other things to the table as well hes not only the chairman of the foreign relations committee but he chaired the senate judiciary committee before that he knows the senate well he knows the congressional bureaucracy the foreign policy establishment and even though hes never been a major rival for the presidential nomination he has always acquitted himself well
8521944 he is an excellent campaigner and will be a tremendous asset to obama
8521945 in terms of india in terms of south asia you cannot find a more knowledgeable person than joe biden and indeed right now the biden lugar legislation on pakistan is the most important piece of legislation in terms of foreign policy on the hill its trying to reorient our foreign policy toward that country to make it more comprehensive not just one that was individual based and transactional as it was before
8521946 it is also clear that joe biden understands the importance of bipartisanship he and richard lugar have worked together when democrats have been in the minority and republicans in the majority when lugar was chairman and vice versa the two of them have worked together across the aisle and i think that is something else that obama wants to pursue as well
8521947 so it was important that not only did obama reach out to bring in somebody with a great record and experience in foreign affairs but also one that has been bipartisan in his approach
8521948 he hasnt left the senate hes still chairman of the foreign relations committee he will know when he needs to be back in the senate to attend to business
8521949 she knows where are all the bodies have been buried in the past 30 or so years of chicago politics and she knows all the tricks
8521950 if obama had a political and financial godmother it would be valerie
8521951 jarrett has done that for barack and michelle three or four times over
8521952 come to see eboue youve only come to see eboue
8521953 if at first you dont succeed call it version 1 0
8521954 der er d d og del ggelse over det hele
8521955 were disappointed not to be in the heineken cup last year what we did in europe was great
8521956 people outside the squad didnt expect us to do that so there was the perception that wed over performed
8521957 but we were very disappointed to finish seventh in the premiership and with that missing out on the heineken cup
8521958 at the start of the season we wanted a top four finish in the end we were well away from that this season we want to target heineken cup qualification
8521959 to be fair we got as many wins as a lot of the teams above us third and fourth even but we just didnt get the bonus points
8521960 this year were going to push for that bonus point if were ahead
8521961 you have to do that because the league is so tight and competitive that it will probably come down to bonus points as well
8521962 catt has stepped up now that smithy has gone hes got so many ideas that hes made the transfer to coach
8521963 its going to be an interesting at irish as mike and smithy have a similar mindset
8521964 theres toby booth to sort the forwards out and keep us on a leash in case we get too loose its exciting times london irish
8521965 we have a good squad this year it may not be the biggest but theres a lot of talent in it
8521966 i wouldnt rule mike out of playing it will take time but hes got ideas hes learning every day and is getting better
8521967 his sessions are enjoyable in the next year or so he will have developed as an individual and us as a team
8521968 november is a long way off but id love to be involved
8521969 i want to stamp my authority on things because its been a while since i was last involved
8521970 one of the targets ive set myself is to get fit and stay fit
8521971 a citizen sees the beating in a parking lot police get there fast they see him beating her its a good solid case
8521972 he was on top of her actually in the act of violently beating her when the officers arrived with the knife in his hand
8521973 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8521974 i imagine people will be writing that we have a good chance but we wont win anything because we cant compete with the best sides on the day
8521975 we put ourselves in a really good position to be able to win we genuinely felt that and then to lose against leicester at home you cant expect to win trophies if you cant win those games
8521976 it was the semi final and if we had won that it would have been a final against wasps but it was literally the end of our season after losing that game
8521977 we knew if we lost it was over but there was still a shell shocked feeling surrounding it all we all felt stunned
8521978 it has taken a long time to get over it and that doesnt mean we are all over it now it wasnt an easy defeat to take
8521979 i know it is pointing out the obvious but we have got to learn from it that is vital
8521980 we did things in that leicester game we hadnt done all season
8521981 it is such small lines between the whole success and failure thing we all know that and what happened at the end of last season has reinforced it even more
8521982 we havent had a million players come in this summer
8521983 weve stuck to the same core squad which is important because you are not having to go over the same things
8521984 we were given handouts and it has been about going home and doing your homework on the law variations
8521985 you watch games and see how things are being done with them in the southern hemisphere and it is about how quickly we can adapt and get used to them
8521986 we are the first to admit that come day one we are not going to be playing perfect rugby or necessarily the right way with these new elvs
8521987 there are going to be a lot of matches that need playing and then you find your feet a bit more and things become easier but everyone is in the same boat
8521988 i would love a chance with england i am excited about learning how they want to play the game

8521993 the us navy destroyer uss mcfaul which is currently docked in the georgian port of batumi carries about 50 tomahawk cruise missiles on board they are outfitted with nuclear warheads and are meant to hit ground targets the remaining nato ships are currently concentrated in the northern part of the black sea
8521994 it is strange that such a large group of nato warships has arrived for a joint exercise with bulgaria or romania usually only one or two warships participate in such exercises so the attempts to substantiate the presence of the naval group with a military exercise does not withstand any criticism
8521995 it is clear that all statements made by the political and defense administration of nato members are accompanied with outspoken militarist demarches the use of nuclear weapons by nato ships in the black sea is out of the question the conventional weapons which the nato naval group has in the region are more than enough to achieve any defense goals which can be exemplified with yugoslavia

8522033 if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment
8522034 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god
8522035 for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it

8522038 verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
8522039 ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god
8522040 if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit
8522041 if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you
8522042 i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you

8522044 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory
8522045 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god
8522046 this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another
8522047 the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will

8522063 thats the america that george bush has left us and thats the america well continue if george excuse me john mccain is elected president of the united states of america freudian slip freudian slip
8522064 you know you can learn a lot about a man campaigning with him debating him seeing how he reacts under pressure you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart i watched how barack touched people how he inspired them and i realized he had tapped into the oldest belief in america we dont have to accept the situation we cannot bear we have the power to change it and change it is exactly what barack obama will do thats what hell do for this country
8522065 you know john mccain is my friend you hear that phrase used a lot in politics i mean it the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by john still amazes me but i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrack to veterans john thinks that during the bush years quote weve made great economic progress i think its been abysmal and in the senate john has voted with president bush 95 and that is very hard to believe thats not change thats more of the same
8522066 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can change the change everybody knows we need barack obamas gonna deliver that change
8522067 barack obama knows that any country who out teaches us today will out compete us tomorrow
8522068 millions of americans have been knocked down and this is the time as americans together we get back up back up together our debt to our parents and our grandparents is too great our obligation to our children is too sacred these are extraordinary times this is an extraordinary election the american people are ready i am ready barack is ready this is his time this is our time this is americas time god bless america and may god protect our troops thank you very much thank you thank you very much

8522087 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
8522088 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8522089 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

8522110 in een ware theocratie matthijs was een begenadigd spreker en kreeg de bevolking in zijn ban die ban werd gebroken toen hij tijdens pasen 1534 de stad uitreed om de belegering van de stad door de verdreven bisschop eigenhandig te verbreken in de waan dat hij over profetische gaven beschikte hij werd echter op smadelijke wijze gedood
8522111 de wederdopers waren het sterkst in het noorden van de nederlanden met name in friesland groningen en het naburige oost friesland reeds in 1530 werd er in de gerechtsboeken melding gemaakt van doperse activiteit in friesland in 1535 kwam jan van geel afkomstig uit deventer vanuit m nster naar friesland om het doperse verzet aan te voeren tegen de keiharde vervolging van de stadhouder schenck van toutenburg tijdens pasen 1535 werd er getracht enkele kloosters in friesland en groningen te bezetten de kloosters waren niet alleen bases van de rooms katholieke kerk maar de stenen gebouwen vormden ook ware vestingen in friesland gelukte het jan van geel om met een paar honderd volgelingen het klooster bloemkamp nabij bolsward te bezetten in groningen mislukte een gelijktijdig geplande actie echter jammerlijk

8522115 its better to play these contending teams than someone thats out of it its more exciting and you can pretend youre in the playoff race you still have got to play thats your job
8522116 this feels good everybody surrounding me get closer i feel important
8522117 i have no problem playing the nickel dime corner safety special teams you see me in the box sometimes i can play deep thats the advantage i have the more you can do thats what they say

8522119 these failures were a cause of the accident which resulted in the death of daniel burman
8522120 it hit the ground the impact had a catapult effect
8522121 burman fell out of his harness because he was not wearing it properly he fell approximately ten metres to the ground and died almost instantly
8522122 it would be to my knowledge the largest penalty ever imposed by a court in this jurisdiction and a significant penalty in the country for offences of this type
8522123 i expect that these breaches of the act are not at the top of the range nevertheless they are serious matters
8522124 more than ever the sat reflects the face of education in this country
8522125 because average sat scores dramatically rise as family income increases its use in the admissions process gives another leg up to children from wealthy households
8522126 establish that the accused was not entitled to the amounts that he claimed and received as the result of his dishonest conduct
8522127 it is incumbent on the prosecution to do this in order to establish to the necessary degree that the accused had an intent to defraud when he forged and uttered the documents in support of his claims
8522128 in the circumstances it is not necessary to make any finding as to whether or not the accused had an honest belief that he was entitled to claim as he did
8522129 for these reasons i conclude that while the accused acted dishonestly in making the claims that he did it has not been established that he did so with the necessary intent to defraud
8522130 accordingly in due course there will be a judgment of acquittal in respect of each of the charges
8522131 im very pleased its been a very significant toll on myself and my family
8522132 its cost me a million dollars in financial costs and an unbelievable toll in personal and psychological costs
8522133 macro taskforce is the most scrutinised homicide investigation in australia both nationally and internationally
8522134 in any of those reviews the 11 that took place none of the reviewers sought to overturn that decision i dont think theres any need to defend
8522135 as an investigator you must undertake to make decisions about material you receive and how you utilise it and they took a decision then with the knowledge of the time in the environment they were in at the time and they stood by that decision and they still do
8522136 and i support them totally because i have been in that situation myself in other investigations
8522137 to say they made the wrong decision is absolutely incorrect
8522138 to say theres anything wrong with the investigation after all the scrutiny it has been placed under is wrong
8522139 what we have got to do at this press conference is move forward and say look this is a new team looking at a very important investigation in wa and we want to resolve it
8522140 youve seen the quality of it now which was one very good concern they had
8522141 they had concerns about public perception of this person if it was released which might turn the public towards one person only we wanted to keep the information coming in broad i cant go back there they had valid reasons
8522142 perth is not what i should be doing right now i really want to go to perth but i cant until i get better
8522143 the doctors said i have the early stages of pneumonia which a lot people probably have
8522144 if you leave an emergency department overcrowded staffing ratios arent kept and elderly patients unfortunately will fall and its a risk
8522145 i have some suspicions and i know of a couple of cases of people who have actually fallen off trolleys but id like to follow it up and double check to make sure what actually happened to them long term
8522146 pressure areas occur people dont get fed properly and get sleep deprived because being in an emergency department our lights are on 24 hours a day seven days a week and they dont get good sleep
8522147 one of the ways that may be delivered is by dropping elective surgery in certain areas for a short period of time
8522148 theres been pressure for the last few weeks and we have been watching this with great concern
8522149 when you change risk management people it has to be viewed as recognising problems so it is mildly positive
8522150 the ambassador outlined the russian federations position on recent developments in georgia
8522151 mr smith stated that australia respects the territorial integrity of georgia and believes that russia should abide by ceasefire arrangements and return to the positions they occupied before the conflict began
8522152 some developers who are seeking help have resorted to paying each other 1 that way if challenged by apples legal department they can argue that they are subcontractors and therefore free to discuss the software
8522153 at my company our lawyers advised us to keep what we considered more or less public software under nda for a very long time because demoing software to someone under nda no matter how many people it is avoids publishing the software and any inventions contained therein we know apples been building up a patent strategy around multi touch maybe their lawyers believe there are patentable inventions described in the iphone sdk and they are telling apple to keep everything under nda until they know provisional patents can be filed within a reasonable amount of time you get a year after publishing in the us but in the eu i think you forfeit any patent claims once your invention is published
8522154 every invention in the iphone sdk is a non published invention and will continue to be so until the nda is lifted
8522155 the response was clear togetherness focus and efficiency the team was sharper and physically better and that is why it made it easier
8522156 obviously there is some relief with the result we knew it would be a difficult game against a quick well organised team
8522157 the positive was that we played a little better than recently we want to win trophies but we also understand the need for money
8522158 i was delighted that dirk kuyt scored the goal his work is tremendous he keeps going right to the end and makes a tremendous contribution to our side
8522159 over two matches we have been the best organised team and we deserved better than to lose like that in the final minutes
8522160 we have produced a high standard in both matches and now i hope that can be continued in our league matches and the uefa cup

8522198 he who is alone with his sins is utterly alone it may be that christians not withstanding corporate worship common prayer and all their fellowship in service may still be left to their loneliness the final breakthrough to fellowship does not occur because though they have fellowship with one another as believers and as devout people they do not have fellowship as the undevout as sinners the pious fellowship permits no one to be a sinner so everyone must conceal his sin from himself and from their fellowship we dare not be sinners many christians are unthinkably horrified when a real sinner is suddenly discovered among the righteous so we remain alone with our sin living in lies and hypocrisy the fact is that we are sinners

8522223 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8522224 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8522225 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8522226 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8522227 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads

8522254 i try to learn as much as i can especially some key words to calm them down out there
8522255 in the venezuelan winter league i learned a little english from a couple of american imports
8522256 for people like me it speaking spanish and english comes naturally
8522257 i was born in puerto rico and i was there for the first five years of my life before moving to the bronx so thats my natural tongue in professional baseball i had to be the interpreter because there werent many coaches who only spoke spanish

8522260 i taught them that chicken is pollo and rice is arroz
8522261 its good for the spanish speaking players to learn english and for the english speaking players to learn spanish
8522262 we know that you didnt murder china but you made the knife and youre going to take credit for it unless you show us the hand they said in some kind of rehearsed english line

8522267 we had all agreed in advance that we would treat them like mushrooms feed them bullshit and keep them in the dark
8522268 these were the things we signed up for but they werent things we expected to happen
8522269 i understood that the repercussions could be serious if i wasnt american if i was tibetan a pro democracy chinese national or a member of the falun gong i would be taken somewhere and shot in the back of the head but i thought they would just send us home
8522270 when i first got put into a detention cell i thought i was going to have to fight someone like a mad man or get owned then this guy gives me a blanket and a candy bar and im thinking im already being made his bitch
8522271 but it turns out that none of these people had committed crimes they were all there for visa issues and paperwork problems and they were doing everything they could to help each other survive
8522272 it was said to us constantly that we would never leave this place and that there was nothing that we could do
8522273 one of the other prisoners comes over to me and says youre going home
8522274 everyone was hugging me and celebrating but all i could think was that these guys werent going home and i dont know if they ever will
8522275 i had this big smile on my face i was ready to soak up all the famousness but then it dawned on me im going through all the stages of traumatic stress i had something when i went in that i didnt leave with torture strips you of something you cant get back

8522282 not as pumpkin y as i would have liked but good spice flavors and just the right balance of sweet but not too sweet also very appealing texture
8522283 this was my favorite i liked that the cookie was moist and soft and that the inside frosting was sweet but not too sweet
8522284 wow incredible this was my favorite of all of the desserts it was amazing the cake was dense moist and had a great texture the pumpkin flavor was subtle but present i think that this is the best pumpkin dessert that i have ever had

8522317 that was part of their history and it helps me understand the gravity and significance of what were doing right now
8522318 im excited that so many people are able to see his intelligence and ability
8522319 what it does is give another image another powerful stereotype almost to counteract a lot of those other images

8522326 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8522327 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8522328 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8522329 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

8522331 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8522332 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

8522349 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8522350 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8522351 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8522352 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8522374 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8522375 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8522376 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8522377 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8522378 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8522379 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8522380 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8522381 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8522382 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8522383 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8522384 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8522385 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8522386 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8522387 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8522388 chiranjeevi ultimately will be a good force in state politics he is a megastar he has a huge fan following we have observed it happening when ntr came into politics said k chandrasekhar rao president trs
8522389 his experience has only been in film acting handling politics is a different kettle of fish said g vinod minister congress
8522390 i have done what i thought was right to protect the safety of the public on our highways
8522391 it will be the members of the general assembly who will have on their hands the consequences of this law i hope and pray no one gets hurt
8522392 we can get no documentation that says anything that has occurred in the past has proven to us that it is dangerous
8522393 these guys are supposed to be on the same side and on a relatively non controversial piece of legislation easley becomes the first governor to have a veto overridden in north carolina history
8522394 were making an exclusion for a small group of people
8522395 when the u s department of defense wants to transport equipment over 8 feet wide they have to apply for a permit when the forest service wants to move bulldozers and equipment to work in areas throughout the state they have to apply for permits just like any agency or any business
8522396 i felt like today the governor saw a mistake that we made by voting for this
8522397 a lot of people try to bring boats that have no business being trailered down these narrow highways to the outer banks
8522398 ive been doing this for 30 years and never had an accident
8522399 one reason we dont have accidents is that when youre towing something like that you know youve got something big behind you and youre more careful going down the road
8522400 this was an odd piece of legislation for the governor to stand on but after the past eight years im not surprised
8522401 this is the most expensive governor initiated session of his term
8522402 we have bridges in north carolina where two cars cant cross at the same time
8522403 the school system doesnt even allow 5 year olds on the playground without supervision but you want elementary students to walk to school
8522404 she was going to stay strong for her babies and she did
8522405 there was prayer lifted up for her all over this county in all the churches
8522406 were just excited to have her found and safe and alive
8522407 unsettled weather with a chance of showers and thunderstorms will persist through friday
8522408 i wouldnt focus on it as being one tight little storm
8522409 we had a chance to elect the first african american statewide in north carolina and we came that close and fell short
8522410 showed that race is something you can transcend and i think barack obama has done that
8522411 edwards was only unfaithful to his wife lieberman was unfaithful to an entire party
8522412 kay hagan does not represent the values of this state she is a trojan horse for a long list of wacky left wing outside groups bent on policies that would horrify most north carolinians if they knew about it
8522413 this is a desperate attempt to distract from the simple fact that its elizabeth dole whos out of touch with north carolinians
8522414 our overarching goal is that people of all ages and their families have the opportunity to live in inclusive responsive communities where they have choices and control over the services they receive
8522415 we have to figure out how to put them together
8522416 it was a large number of karlodinium its important to continue to look into it and not overlook it
8522417 were getting better at monitoring it and pinpointing it and linking it to fish kills that might occur a week later
8522418 the frequency and intensity of the blooms may very well be related to nutrient loads in our estuaries
8522419 the problem has been in the past this organism was thought to be nontoxic
8522420 we talked to guys from those markets in durham and carrboro who said it was several years of three guys sitting in a parking lot until it even got to our size
8522421 it can be really good or it can be nothing
8522422 theres a huge demographic that just keeps growing and growing that wants local produce and sustainable farms i know the customers are out there we just need to connect with them
8522423 people see a market slowly dying like that and theyre not going to patronize it
8522424 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8522425 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8522426 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8522427 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8522428 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8522429 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8522430 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8522431 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8522432 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8522433 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8522434 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8522435 who are open to doing something on the production side
8522436 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8522437 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8522438 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8522439 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8522440 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8522441 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8522442 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8522443 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8522444 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8522445 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8522446 weve seen some pretty egregious examples that dont fit a misdemeanor
8522447 we want to make sure that we dont make it so hostile to potential candidates that we cant get people to run for office
8522448 and we also want to make sure we dont create felony penalties for everything so that weve got so many in prison for campaign finance violations that we dont have room for people who commit violent crimes
8522449 the indictments and convictions will continue until either the leadership of the general assembly decides to change the culture of the institution or voters adopt a throw the bums out mentality
8522450 i dont think its in the states interests to extend the time of his incarceration
8522451 it was impossible to win based on the instructions the jury was given
8522452 never did i think we would be able to position ourselves to nominate an african american as president of the united states
8522453 i did not think it would happen in my lifetime
8522454 i thought he meant a few million dollars he told me he could compete i thought he meant two or three states
8522455 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8522456 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8522457 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8522458 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8522459 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8522460 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8522461 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8522462 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8522463 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
8522464 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
8522465 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
8522466 you have to cry and try and figure out what in the world could i do
8522467 graeme picked up the injury during the ipl tournament earlier this year but of course he also tore a hamstring as well
8522468 he had five weeks out of the game which helped both the elbow and hamstring injuries but we werent told how serious the tennis elbow was during our first tour match at taunton it flared up while he was batting in the nets and our job has been to somehow keep him on the field for the rest of the tour
8522469 wed been giving him painkillers and anti inflammatories as well as icing and acupuncture but that innings which was far longer than we expected effectively nailed him
8522470 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
8522471 please understand that the law recognizes a difference between what we call a true threat thats one that can actually be carried out and the reported racist rantings of drug abusers
8522472 the jargon for this sometimes is it was more aspirational than operational in this particular case theres insufficient evidence that there was any kind of plot or conspiracy
8522473 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
8522474 i have instructed our troopers to aggressively enforce the speed laws
8522475 dont try to cut a few minutes off your travel time by speeding or driving aggressively its just not worth it
8522476 it is necessary to take into full account the issue of food security in tackling the challenges in energy climate change and other fields

8522491 this is the reality we are facing our concern is that consumers buying power is decreasing
8522492 if this situation continues long term it would affect sony
8522493 sony would like to address the needs of this drastically expanding market to establish a leading position
8522494 we expect the next move in the bank rate to be down but the extent to which this will revive the mortgage and housing market is likely to be limited while overall confidence in economic and housing market conditions is low

8522513 ive been involved in most of those years and it feels pretty special
8522514 ive had time to think about my career and my seasons here and all those times when ive taken it for granted and sort of not really realising that it may come to an end one day
8522515 lo and behold its coming to an end on sunday and its going to be a very emotional occasion and deja vu second time around for me
8522516 i came back to replace the experience that was lost when awen guttenbeil and sione faumuina left

8522528 todo lo que he aprendido en mis ocho a os como presidente y en el trabajo que he hecho desde entonces en am rica y en cualquier parte del mundo me ha convencido de que barack obama es el hombre ideal para desempe ar este cargo
8522529 y restaurar el liderazgo del pa s en el mundo
8522530 nosotros luchamos en una campa a en donde los republicanos me dijeron que era muy joven y muy inexperto para gobernar el pa s
8522531 no funcion en 1992 porque est bamos en lo cierto y no funcionar en 2008 porque obama est en el bando correcto
8522532 quieren que les recompensemos por los ocho a os que nos han dado cedi ndoles cuatro m s
8522533 los americanos lo pueden hacer mejor que eso y barack obama lo conseguir
8522534 john mccain es mi amigo hemos viajado por todo el mundo juntos es una amistad que va m s all del plano pol tico su hero smo me ha asombrado

8522537 el ex presidente bill clinton nos ha recordado lo que es un mandatario que antepone a las personas por encima de todo
8522538 you dont really need a new cartridge but your printer tells you that you do
8522539 you can learn an awful lot about a man campaigning with him debating him and seeing how he reacts under pressure
8522540 you learn about the strength of his mind but even more importantly you learn about the quality of his heart
8522541 with appreciation for the spirit and dedication of all who are gathered here with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that is our candidate
8522542 i move that the convention suspend the procedural rules and suspend the future conduct of the roll call vote
8522543 all votes cast by the delegates will be counted and i move of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the
8522544 i love this and i thank you but we have important work to do here tonight
8522545 but im very proud of the campaign she ran she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wants for all our children and im grateful for the chance chelsea and i had to tell americans about the person we know and love
8522546 im not so grateful for the chance to speak in the wake of her magnificent address last night but ill do my best hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect that makes two of us
8522547 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8522548 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8522549 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8522550 at the start of this campaign we had a very simple idea which is change in america doesnt start from the top down
8522551 it starts from the bottom up that change is brought about because ordinary people do extraordinary things and so we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody who wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8522552 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8522553 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out for the last seven years this administration has failed to face the biggest forces shaping this century
8522554 and the resurgence of fudamentalism in the real central front against terrorism
8522555 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8522556 we cannot afford four more years like the past eight years
8522557 policies that embolden our enemies undermine our economy and place an unfair burden on the heores of our armed forces asks that we trust republicans to safeguard our national security to which we can only reply why would we
8522558 so who can we trust to keep america safe the mccain bush republicans have been wrong again and again and again
8522559 with america fighting two wars the 9 11 terrorists still at large and russia in georgia america needs a president who gets it right first time
8522560 our troops are courageous strong and fierce this administration has re deployed them until they are overstretched stressed and strained

8522576 i had gone to so many speed dating events where i had nothing in common with the guys i was meeting
8522577 i thought the concept of speed dating was great in the sense that it increased the odds that you would hit it off with someone however i still wasnt meeting the guys i wanted to meet and thats when it hit me speed dating had the quantity aspect covered if we could just find a way to incorporate the quality portion by increasing the chance for connection we could offer something the other sites werent
8522578 speed dating for women 59 and taller and men 62 and taller
8522579 a lot of women are into and requesting these types of events were like burger king in the sense that we want you to have it your way
8522580 i can usually tell if im into someone within the first few minutes and when i wasnt id end up being stuck with them for the entire night

8522748 after suffering a long term slump the dollar rose more than 8 this past month in relation to the euro
8522749 slew of etfs launched in the past two years that allow investors exposure to different currencies
8522750 udn benefited from the dollar decline earlier this year rising more than 7 from january 2 to march 19

8522785 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
8522786 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective

8522793 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
8522794 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
8522795 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government

8522824 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre

8522831 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8522832 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8522833 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8522841 che lunione di centro ha potuto riscuoter consensi senza rimaner schiacciata fra le due grandi coalizioni elettorali pdl lega e pd idv mantenendo quindi una significativa rappresentanza parlamentare la nostra condotta politica oggi di un partito di opposizione ma si contraddistingue per la seriet e la coerenza verso i nostri elettori siamo consci che nel periodo in cui viviamo i veti pregiudiziali e lostruzionismo allazione di governo siano deleteri per un paese che cerca di risollevarsi testimonianza ne la presenza in aula dei nostri parlamentari a garanzia del numero legale per un corretto svolgimento dei lavori di contro votar a scatola chiusa i disegni di legge presentati significherebbe allinearsi su posizioni che non ci appartengono e sulle quali nutriamo forti perplessit

8522894 as i grew up i realized a principle in my life you dont know what you can do until you try its not about how you look and what you wear its who you are even without arms and legs you still have a purpose
8522895 ive spoken to millions of people across the world but to be honest i was a little bit nervous to meet bethany ive always wanted to surf and i think bethanys gonna be a great coach

8522902 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8522903 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8522904 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8522905 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8522906 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8522907 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8522908 we carried out the targeted road check a week on from the collision in the hope of speaking to people who may have been in the area at the time it happened
8522909 im still very keen to talk to a man we understand to be a soldier who stopped and offered help at the scene at the time and who may have witnessed the incident
8522910 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8522911 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store

8522916 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8522917 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

8522925 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8522926 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8522927 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8522928 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8522929 i need you to sit now so we can start our lesson
8522930 if you are not a good payer you wont get credit and you will have to pay cod cash on delivery if you cant do that you wont get oil
8522931 i know im paying more because of people who are not paying on time
8522932 the knowledge worker and the ad hoc use of paper
8522933 estuve expectante el momento del despegue pero porque todos en el avi n estaban mirando para m eh pero nada no he sentido nada en especial s que tienes un cierto por ver el tema del despegue pero nada especial
8522934 un olor a quemado horroroso y gente que gritaba pidiendo ayuda
8522935 vengo con mucha mucha alegr a porque vuelvo a mi casa y vuelvo
8522936 tambi n con mucha tristeza porque s que aqu se est n viviendo d as muy duros han fallecido muchas personas muchas familias
8522937 no s a veces siento hasta culpabilidad de venir yo de esta manera y que otros vengan de otra
8522938 me gustar a ser noticia hoy y ma ana salir de mi casa sin sentir acoso
8522939 en todo momento me he sentido como en mi casa
8522940 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8522941 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8522942 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8522943 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8522944 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8522945 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8522946 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8522947 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8522948 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8522949 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8522950 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8522951 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8522952 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8522953 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8522954 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8522955 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8522956 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8522957 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8522958 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8522959 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8522960 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8522961 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8522962 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8522963 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8522964 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8522965 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8522966 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8522967 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8522968 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8522969 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8522970 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8522971 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8522972 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8522973 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8522974 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8522975 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8522976 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8522977 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8522978 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8522979 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8522980 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8522981 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8522982 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8522983 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8522984 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8522985 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8522986 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8522987 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8522988 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8522989 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8522990 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8522991 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8522992 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8522993 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8522994 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8522995 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8522996 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8522997 no one works for someone we all just work together
8522998 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8522999 our success is going to be largely dependent on our ability to expand globally
8523000 we used to design products for global requirements and distribute the same product globally
8523001 in this situation we started with talking to emerging country customers designing a product for emerging countries and our initial launch of the product is only in emerging countries thats a big departure in our strategy
8523002 these economies are growing so fast that we dont want to miss out on the opportunity
8523003 but if we just use the direct model it might take too long to get there
8523004 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8523005 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8523006 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8523007 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8523008 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8523009 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8523010 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8523011 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8523012 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8523013 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8523014 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8523015 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8523016 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8523017 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8523018 rien ne nous emp chera de former un nouveau gouvernement

8523027 personal navigation devices come with more brand icons search functionality and photo viewing features that previous models here are the major features of the new models
8523028 just imagine my last test appearance was in india in december sometimes it is frustrating how can a country go without a test match for eight months
8523029 the postponement of the australians tour to pakistan didnt help us at all but still we need more test matches otherwise we will not improve our position in icc rankings
8523030 there is too much stress on one day cricket these days while it is good to have international cricket and i would love to be part of it but i still want to be playing more test cricket
8523031 it has been a most frustrating injury but one of those things which one cant help i know in the past the pcb has not been very happy with the number of overs i bowled in a season for essex but this season i have been very careful with more support from other bowlers
8523032 that a group of thugs in a government vehicle could systematically ransack the offices of critical newspapers senegals reputation as a beacon of press freedom in west africa has dimmed in recent years
8523033 theyve done it before so yeah weve got to go out and play well
8523034 were off a break were i guess under a bit of pressure and its up to these guys now its up to us to put our hands up and perform well and basically if they play good cricket we have to match it
8523035 the australian a team said it swung up here a bit early in the morning
8523036 so hopefully it we get the chance to bowl early we can utilise that and it would actually give me more of a chance to get a few early wickets and hopefully just bowl well
8523037 he has played two crucial knocks and he is outstanding
8523038 at this level youngsters do not get many opportunities i am happy that they have grabbed the opportunities that came their way
8523039 i read the hands of murali and mendis my game plan was that if i could read their bowling i could play them well
8523040 our batting has let us down disappointed the way we played we had opportunities but we have not utilised but one day cricket cannot be predicted and is about opportunities overall performance with the bat has been inconsistent
8523041 they performed such tricks as shooting bullets through the windows breaking down the door dragging the couple out of bed and tumbling them about on the floor and indulging in other equally innocent tricks
8523042 mcnabbs back to 100 health its going to be like 2002 2004 all over again
8523043 jeg vil gerne v re med til at se p en modernisering af dagpengesystemet
8523044 d kningsgraden som folk kan f n r de bliver ledige er s ringe at folk ikke l ngere organiserer sig i a kasserne det er et problem for arbejdsmarkedet fordi dagpengene er en v sentlig brik i den danske flexicurity model

8523046 we have worked very closely with a lot of community groups to try to drive down these sorts of attacks
8523047 these people in rainbows end have the attention span of a butterfly
8523048 theyll alight on a topic use it in a particular way and then theyre on to something else right now people worry that we dont have lifetime employment anymore how extreme could that get i could imagine a world where everything is piecework and the piece duration is less than a minute
8523049 imagine yourself confined to your house with only limited data access to the outside to your masters if those masters thought at a rate say one million times slower than you there is little doubt that over a period of years your time you could come up with helpful advice that would incidentally set you free
8523050 i think theres a good possibility that humanity will itself participate in the singularity
8523051 but on the other hand we could just be left behind
8523052 maybe we need the humans around because theyre natural critters who could survive in situations where some catastrophe would cause technology to disappear that way theyd be around to bring back the important things namely us
8523053 its always a goal to be part of that team as well
8523054 i think its probably more the novelty than anything just getting four engines all to run in unison and together with the belts and the sound
8523055 1 2 of the gdp each year for the next 20 years toward once and for all eliminating domestic and global poverty homelessness hunger inadequate education inadequate health care and repairing the environment of the planet
8523056 take a deep breath and breathe in that holy spirit of peace help us end poverty and starvation and relieveable sic disease and end the war in iraq and afghanistan and palestine and all of our wars and abolish the death penalty and torture and all our nuclear weapons and help us enact a global marshall plan to feed the worlds poor and justice and peace to all our sisters and brothers

8523061 new nominees for parents of the year mama and papa duff
8523062 hes done a great job improving his game and becoming a better thrower coach skip holtz said
8523063 hes become a great leader become vocal he knows his role has taken it and run with it
8523064 ive worked extra hard ive watched more film my arms gotten stronger
8523065 secondly i told him to play within himself within the system he doesnt have to win the game by himself
8523066 the last couple of years its been shouldve couldve wouldve
8523067 i want to lead this team and at the end of the year i want my teammates to tell me i had a great year and played hard
8523068 several previous studies have observed these cells ability to inhibit specific subsets of t cells and relieve symptoms in particular autoimmune disorders but this is the first demonstration of their ability to suppress a broad based autoimmune reaction and protect gastrointestinal tissue
8523069 los c mics me han dado tanto a lo largo de los a os que es hora de que devuelva parte de mi deuda
8523070 kids used to pick on me and torment me but it made me a better person
8523071 there were days when i was on the school bus and had my baseball hat thrown out of the window its funny because the people who did that are now trying to come back and be friends and its like no
8523072 one of my teachers at middle school i cant remember his name said i would never be successful when someone says that im going to work even harder to prove him wrong it was a dream come true to achieve something no one has done before
8523073 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
8523074 a developing foetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
8523075 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
8523076 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
8523077 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
8523078 to love god love people thats the center of the mark
8523079 gt solamente acci n nacional y el revolucionario institucional pueden presidirla porque son los nicos que tienen m s del 25 de los voto

8523082 and by the time i made the decision to transition my gender dissonance had gotten so bad that it completely consumed me it hurt more than any pain physical or emotional that i had ever experienced when i made the decision to transition i honestly had no idea what it would be like for me to live as female the only thing i knew for sure was that pretending to be male was slowly killing me
8523083 we are able to see the scrolls in such detail that no one has before
8523084 this is to acknowledge that the verdict handed down came from a nonlegal trial and that anna goeldi was the victim of judicial murder
8523085 in spite of that they tortured an innocent person and had her executed although it was known to them that the alleged crime was neither doable nor possible and that there was no legal basis for their verdict
8523086 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrests and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8523087 personally i hope jeff stays on im good mates with him and hes been really good to me especially when i first came back
8523088 hes a role model for all the boys not just the aboriginal ones and hopefully things work out for him and he can play on next year
8523089 its definitley a hard decision for robbie at the moment with what hes going through
8523090 if anything does happen i will understand it but hopefully he does stay
8523091 if we are working on the basis of our mutual interests then its logical to implement this agreement
8523092 this is an old way of doing things that has nothing to do with modern realities
8523093 primarily i think the u s was looking for things to take away and penalize russia for in georgia
8523094 this is a vote of no confidence in improving u s russian relations
8523095 miley cyrus is just a little too tarty forgive me i dont want her to look like shes going into a convent school but its just a little too much for a 15 year old if i didnt know better id swear she was 25
8523096 they walk around telling each other how great they are and i keep saying to them someone is gonna go home
8523097 shes got to get away from that and shes constantly defending thats what i do then youre nothing but a one note you better get prepared to pack your bags
8523098 they really arent even that close theres no way shed go to denver just because eva was
8523099 he was never going anyone who says otherwise is clueless
8523100 i dont know why people are always so shocked we have kids together we are going to see each other for the rest of our lives its just how it is might as well make the best of it and be friends
8523101 we could very well be in that quick slide downward in terms of passing a tipping point
8523102 it also means that climate warming is also coming larger and faster than the models are predicting and nobodys really taken into account that change yet
8523103 for a 200 investment weve made we got featured in the local newspaper once twice on tv and its the buzz around town i cant get a quarter page ad for 200
8523104 i personally would encourage them that having people from their church build relationships with their friends who do not attend church and invite them as their friend would be a much better strategy
8523105 they are appealing to the natural corruptions in unbelieving people the bible warns very explicitly about the dangers of greed the love of money being the root of all evil
8523106 appealing to the selfish motives of people is not christianity
8523107 we canceled services that day and said our service to the community will be our service
8523108 this wasnt a gimmick hey come to our church there was no bait and switch we didnt try to convert people we just wanted to show we care
8523109 there are a lot of worse things that people can be doing in life than getting people to come to church
8523110 are they being tempted to think the church is about such gimmicks and external rewards
8523111 i was young na ve enough to think i would see that in 5 10 years
8523112 then you see leaders killed you see police brutality residential segregation in cities about 10 years ago i thought i wont see this this is something for my grandchildren
8523113 we have a lot of work a lot but we are so much closer than i expected
8523114 we have one foot in both eras were still living out a lot of anger
8523115 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
8523116 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
8523117 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
8523118 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
8523119 the shc deposed judges oath taking has shocked the legal fraternity as it was in violation of the constitution and against the commitment they made and stand they took on november 3 2007
8523120 i consider the judges reappointment is a violation of the constitution betrayal to the people and acceptance of the position of november 3 2007 taken by pervez musharraf and adopted by ppp co chairman asif ali zardari
8523121 the underhand practice of the government seems to be creating a rift and division amongst the deposed judges and causing damage to the lawyers movement for restoration of judges and constitution
8523122 they have disappointed us by accepting the fresh appointment as judges of the sindh high court admitting that the unconstitutional steps taken on november 3 2007 were legal
8523123 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8523124 she did an incredible job i was sitting with all my obama organizer friends and we were all crying this is a turning point she struck a blow for unity
8523125 there were no changes on this branch in the last 10 days

8523128 the shanghai cooperation organization sco has grown rapidly in the past few years and has become an important link in the contemporary international relations
8523129 i hope that more countries and international organizations would establish close ties with the sco
8523130 i was successful when i was sleeping on a park bench because i knew where i was and i knew where i was going
8523131 im very happy for the iranian people and my medal belongs to the
8523132 bring the things your child will use on a daily basis
8523133 excuse me i need a moment of silence so i can get into a meditative state where i block out any irritating white noise i call it my happy place
8523134 i am not sure what we saw in valencia was mixed again and in the second run in qualifying two it was almost a perfect lap
8523135 he was struggling before in two specific areas of the track and in that one lap he was able to do that very cleanly
8523136 i hope it gives him the confidence to be strong again in the races he has been strong i think he will be back on track
8523137 to arrive at this finding brain scans were made of 22 newborns
8523138 brain activity increased in the babies temporal and left frontal areas whenever the repetitious words were played
8523139 unless we act quickly the gap between the haves and the have nots will grow uncontrollably exacerbating existing inequalities and condemning millions more people to poverty
8523140 for too long experts have been crossing their fingers and hoping that growth alone will be sufficient to draw people out of poverty the fact that inequality prevents growth from being effective in tackling poverty has been largely ignored
8523141 the only way to end the gross inequalities that have condemned more than a billion people to poverty is through a massive redistribution of power assets and opportunities
8523142 at the heart of this approach is empowerment of poor people in communities and of poor countries in global institutions
8523143 from poverty to power sets out a clear manifesto for tackling poverty in the 21st century it represents a stark warning but also a clear vision of what we have to do and how we have to do it the challenge is clear as the book states fail and future generations will not forgive us succeed and they will wonder why we left it so long
8523144 all of us share an interest in sustaining constructive relations between our campus police and the broader harvard community in order to provide a safe and welcoming environment for all faculty students staff and visitors
8523145 i am confident that this groups efforts will help the university address this important set of issues in a constructive spirit and forthright manner
8523146 ive been hosting moderating and mediating meetings between harvards black students and university police for much of the last 20 years and it always stems from an individual incident when african americans appear to be the subject of racial profiling by the police department
8523147 the problem is a persistent one because theres still this unfortunate assumption that equates the color of a persons skin with involvement in criminality
8523148 we look forward to any recommendations generated by the process that will help ensure the hupd remains as effective as possible
8523149 if you talk to any student in the black community theyll talk about being targeted
8523150 i hope this committee will be able to initiate a thoughtful conversation that we have not been able to accomplish to date
8523151 this is really an effort to identify what the university police do well as well as what the areas of improvement potentially are were going to go at it as objectively as possible
8523152 if only nod has a unique support power on their super weapon shouldmt the other factions get something
8523153 in 10 years we have had over 17 000 australians take part and they have together walked over a million kilometres

8523162 failing to help others often leads to shame which is a powerful negative emotion that is experienced when there is an inconsistency between a persons actual and desired self
8523163 paradoxically it is by helping others that we derive self benefits in the form of enhanced self esteem and social approval serving others connotes valued human traits including compassion cooperativeness and kindness

8523176 la cui melodia quasi ossessiva e il ritornello orecchiabile e un po perverso non possono certo lasciare indifferenti
8523177 resa straordinaria e unica del proprio genere grazie proprio al cantato malinconico di till che diventa una cosa sola con il delicato arpeggio che vaga incerto su se stesso per poi sfociare in un riff possente e irresistibilmente melodico nel ritornello
8523178 rappresenta la sfaccettatura pi dolce e in un certo qual modo pi romantica dei rammstein mentre la canzone che chiude lalbum
8523179 appunto ne mostra il lato pi oscuro pi truce e pi shock un cupo e incalzante beat elettronico che si fonde con lelica di un aereo poi un riff lento indugiante e minaccioso che si protrae allinfinito con un incupito till che intona una macabra poesia che si spegne senza mai esplodere chiudendo il disco in modo inaspettato
8523180 rammstein un bambino morto rammstein odore di carne bruciata rammstein il sole si spento rammstein un mare di fiamme rammstein una carneficina rammstein le gocce di sangue sullasfalto rammstein nessun uccello cant pi rammstein rammstein

8523205 there have been stray incidents of violence in kandhamal we have also received reports of people burning a church in the district of bolangir said director general of police gopal chandra nanda adding that more than 3 000 policemen had been deployed
8523206 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defence
8523207 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8523208 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8523209 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness

8523213 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8523214 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8523215 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8523216 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8523217 that is sort of the major achievement or milestone that we all had to reach

8523277 so far this winter the flu season has been mild compared to last year
8523278 52 adults and children from around tasmania have been confirmed to have influenza so far this year but there has been an increase in notifications in the last few weeks
8523279 we wont know what is causing the flu like illness affecting lauderdale primary school until we get test results back in the next 24 hours
8523280 flu spreads easily and can cause serious illness and hospitalisation especially for older people and people with chronic illnesses
8523281 its important not to go back to work or school until you are fully recovered so you dont spread the disease to others
8523282 the flu vaccine is effective against influenza vaccine is still available but it takes around two weeks to be fully effective
8523283 the flu is very contagious and a person can infect others before they even realise they are sick
8523284 always cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue or your elbow if you dont have a tissue

8523293 the removal of musharraf was the binding point between the two parties and their split was quite natural after musharraf s resignation now he is thinking of watching his interests for the next elections
8523294 why should i not support them because they are the largest party and the people have given them the mandate in the last general elections also zardari fulfilled all his promises made to me
8523295 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8523296 these rocks could not have got there until icebergs started to form and could transport them indicating that large amounts of ice on greenland only began to form about three million years ago
8523297 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet

8523356 helen clark has to stand him down just imagine the briefing note that visiting dignitaries get when they meet the minister of foreign affairs here is a guy whose misled the people of new zealand the prime minister and by the way his party is being investigated by the serious fraud office
8523357 would take some years for new zealand to get over
8523358 the serious fraud office is independent from government and treats a minister of the crown just like a private citizen and not above the law
8523359 i want to emphasise that it is entirely possible that there are innocent and honest explanations the use of statutory power to require documents to be provided will enable the sfo to ascertain how funds were applied
8523360 on information currently to hand there are serious questions whether donations intended for one purpose may have been put to a different purpose
8523361 the allegations concern important matters relating to the funding of a political party which go to the heart of the democratic process and involve a minister in the government
8523362 theyre not ruling it out and there may well be further evidence uncovered
8523363 it was one of those meetings to help clear up the situation get an understanding of the issues and look for a way forward
8523364 the meeting was mainly to continue to discuss ongoing operations against extremists in the border region and to work together to find better ways to solve those problems
8523365 we bought the land in 1943 with the intention of building a new church but due to the war we couldnt build the church
8523366 we have been trying for many years to get back the land but the city government kept saying there is not enough of a basis to settle the dispute
8523367 this has made parishioners upset forcing them to break into the plot earlier this month
8523368 we have not arrested anyone yet but we will if necessary
8523369 mobilized every measure to patiently educate and persuade but the church still refuses to stop its illegal activities
8523370 the city has a wide range of media while the parishioners do not have any forum to raise their voice
8523371 to my knowledge this is the highest price for any slice of the cake sold at auction
8523372 she was very sentimental about the cake she loved the royal family and looked back with great fondness
8523373 al qaeda hurt us but not as much as rupert murdoch
8523374 mit marcell jansen setzen wir ebenso wie mit dem transfer von alex silva unseren weg der verpflichtungen hoch ambitionierter spieler mit gro er perspektive fort marcell hat sein internationales niveau bereits nachgewiesen und wird uns deutlich voran bringen
8523375 wir hatten uns schon vor dem wechsel zu bayern m nchen intensiv um marcell bem ht
8523376 michelle and i were deeply saddened to hear that del martin had passed del committed her life to fighting discrimination and promoting equality our thoughts and prayers go out to her spouse phyllis lyon and all those who were touched by her life
8523377 i was trying to take more control of my career
8523378 you get some nice projects over the transom but its ultimately at somebodys whim
8523379 i dont think people outside the movie industry pay much attention to who produces the liability is still much more on the acting side
8523380 every time you get a chance to make a major movie a lot of people are taking a big gamble on you
8523381 it was 2003 and no one had made a post 9 11 movie yet
8523382 and i was naturally trepidatious about turning news events into art or entertainment or whatever label you want to put on it
8523383 but philosophically what i was trying to do was take on the subject of suicide bombers from a fresh angle and look at moral dilemmas not simply filtered through a black or white lens
8523384 its like having drawn the blueprints for a building that you cant get built
8523385 i believe in writing and rewriting even while shooting i dont want to be one of those directors so married to the script that you miss the opportunity to do something better
8523386 when you come from what i come from my friend its a drug id get up at 4 a m to start training
8523387 you cant play with this subject you have a responsibility you have to be honest my character is not the bad guy hes religious and his faith is being exploited
8523388 terrorism is an abomination against humanity and people do commit terrible acts in the name of islam but i dont believe for a moment that thats the true face of islam what the film tries to show is that a man of islamic faith can make the right choice
8523389 i was dropping off my r sum at his office in new york when i bumped into him in the stairwell he offered me a job on the spot as his assistant and story editor and i helped him sell his art collection which was magnificent my parents had given me a ticket for europe and he said well brandeis boy you must make a choice so i dropped the europe plan and started work the next monday
8523390 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business

8523394 during the consultation process around removing unprofitable payphones a number of suggestions have been voiced
8523395 we have listened to these suggestions and can now confirm that local authorities that wish to maintain red telephone boxes minus the telephone equipment for aesthetic or heritage reasons will able to do so
8523396 in addition local authorities that have requested to contribute to costs to retain a red telephone box with a working telephone will also be accommodated

8523398 tonight russian troops are sweeping through it pushing georgians out and over the border its ethnic cleansing
8523399 if they want a degradation of relations they will get it
8523400 we are not afraid of anything including the prospect of a new cold war
8523401 they are even starting to supply new types of weapons restoring the military infrastructure that was used in the aggression
8523402 the end of the revival of russias imperialism has started
8523403 we will not solve conflicts if we do not talk to each other
8523404 with this it will be more difficult for the moderates to say we should not alienate russia
8523405 im sure that belarus will become one of the first countries to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
8523406 could have the nature of a precedent and destabilise other regions in the world
8523407 now that weve caught up and gone over the average it makes the area more susceptible to floods if there are additional heavy rains
8523408 los encuentros celebrados quedan para el recuerdo y hay que sacar lo bueno de cada uno de ellos a n ganando para llegar m s fortalecidos al compromiso contra monterrey porque es un equipo muy complicado
8523409 estoy bien ya revisaron mi rodilla y no hay problemas simplemente fue para prevenir una lesi n el golpe fue en una jugada que le gan a robert de pinho y alcanc a chocar con l pero todo est bien y tengo toda la confianza de que hoy pueda entrenar normal para poder jugar el s bado
8523410 hay que aprovechar esta buena racha y alargarla lo m s que se pueda
8523411 la fe de dar en cada jugada el m ximo y las individualidades que tenemos arriba siempre sobresalen
8523412 i want the chairman of nice to come down and speak to these people i want him to look into the eyes of the people whose lives he would cut short
8523413 it has made me feel more like my old self and ive only been on it for three weeks
8523414 last week i went shopping for the first time in eight months thats how well im feeling i am here to support all these people i feel very angry about what nice is doing
8523415 my professor and other professors have said how good this drug is
8523416 lots of people have worked hard and put money into the country and now they cant get it i never thought i would see the day when this country would do that
8523417 in my letter to nice i said they were condemning kidney cancer patients to an early death

8523423 his grandma brought him up and she is a super woman
8523424 we kept in touch and he came up to see me
8523425 if he was fostered i would have had to sign papers
8523426 i havent seen him for about five years but i have been helping with his training
8523427 and only the other day one of the lads from the gym took a ton of protein shakes down free of charge
8523428 i am still his dad and i will always support him but i just want to ask him why he is lying like this
8523429 dont throw me off i didnt mean to lie honestly i was a bit confused i just want a proper relationship with my parents and didnt explain myself
8523430 weve spoken to alan turner and he assures us that the allegations made against him are not true and he has not lied to anyone
8523431 as far as were concerned alan has not deceived us and this does not affect his place within the show
8523432 i repeat it russias action in georgia is very dangerous and there are other objectives that one can suppose are objectives for russia in particular the crimea ukraine and moldova
8523433 not to provide any pretext for russian actions because of course the russians have used those pretexts in the georgian case
8523434 the end of the post cold war period of growing geopolitical calm in and around europe
8523435 we dont want a new cold war medvedev has a big responsibility not to start one
8523436 ukraine could be the next target of political pressure by russia
8523437 it is important from a stability point of view that the eu sends a clear political signal that ukraines integration into the european union is possible
8523438 excessive use of military force in georgia and its continued occupation of parts of georgia
8523439 fundamental agreements and principles of trust can be lost via thoughtless steps when diplomacy and the policy of peaceful settlement are replaced with a policy of force
8523440 if we dont change the position on crimea if we dont harmonise relations with the black sea fleet we will be in for very serious problems
8523441 as regards the recognition of transnistria this is a matter of time
8523442 it is moldova that should be the first to recognise us
8523443 if they want to live in peace with us they have no other option
8523444 moldova should draw its own positive conclusions after the conflict in south ossetia
8523445 i believe moldovan leaders will use their wisdom to not allow such a bloody and catastrophic trend of events
8523446 this fully meets the principle of the self determination of nations and fundamental norms of international law
8523447 despite all our efforts to gain access to south ossetia none of our partners nor ourselves have been able to enter so far
8523448 could have the nature of a precedent and destabilise other regions in the world
8523449 we have a health records policy and information security and confidentiality practices and procedure in place and take the matter of lost patient records very seriously
8523450 we have an electronic case record tracking system at the trust which tracks the location of notes at the trusts hospitals and to other areas outside the trust and notes are delivered in sealed bags for security
8523451 twenty one files is a small amount compared to the number of patients records we handle at our hospitals but any missing patient record is one too many and we never stop looking
8523452 apart from the potential distress to those involved it demonstrated a weakness in what we thought was a secure transport system
8523453 all of the patients involved in this incident were contacted and a great deal of work was put into ensuring all relevant information was retrieved from our systems
8523454 we also reviewed our transport and security arrangements to ensure as far as we can that this does not happen again
8523455 this is typical of what goes on in the nhs
8523456 the nhs locally has legal responsibility to comply with data protection rules they are expected to take data loss extremely seriously be open about incidents and about the action taken as a result
8523457 we have written to all senior health managers reminding them of their responsibilities
8523458 in terms of the one remaining case we are intending to make a visit to the site and see if we can find a resolution
8523459 there are a few potholes and if they are filled in we could get to the first cottage and if that happened im sure that the installation of a post box would result in a short walk for residents
8523460 the royal navy does not tolerate misuse of drugs by its personnel and internal action is underway against all 18 individuals
8523461 notwithstanding the numbers involved in this single unprecedented incident which is being treated very seriously it has not affected the ships ability to do its job
8523462 i think the handling obviously leaves a great deal to be desired ms clark said
8523463 its not the way i would handle issues but there you go
8523464 helen clark should be standing him down and sacking him as a minister
8523465 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and around the world has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8523466 lets declare together in one voice that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8523467 does he find it acceptable that the state broadcaster tvnz confronted with evidence of orchestrated perjury to parliament not only fails to notify the police but orders the tape and transcripts destroyed thereby obstructing justice
8523468 i have no information that what that member says is correct
8523469 wayne crapper claims that his former boss peter simunovich told him to lie to the special select committee that had been set up to investigate simunovich scampi fishing practices
8523470 it was made quite clear to me that i had to lie otherwise i wouldnt be doing what i was gonna do run a scampi boat
8523471 he told me i had to cover up the answers
8523472 we have also been contacting infectious disease and infection control specialists from hospitals with experience of large scale norovirus outbreaks to critique actions we have taken so far and identify possible options
8523473 they tend to drive faster and theyre probably a little bit more impatient on the road women on the other hand are very courteous but theyre perhaps a little bit less confident
8523474 the accidents for men tend to more collisions possibly a little higher speed
8523475 whereas with women they tend to be more smaller accidents in the car park perhaps difficulty judging a distance so they are smaller claims

8523516 chris looks good back there wide receiver was not his position
8523517 he covers our guys comes up makes tackles at the line of scrimmage he runs 4 3 seconds in the 40 yard dash hes a good looking athlete back there
8523518 we told him he could play what he wanted to
8523519 we were going to give him a chance and that helped us get him
8523520 i will never forget the look on the faces of the syracuse players and the fans in the carrier dome
8523521 thats one good thing about playing on thursday night especially this thursday night the first one everybody that doesnt want to watch politics can watch football
8523522 it was a great win for us and the program it got us some national standing because everybody was saying whos n c state we were total underdogs but we ended up winning
8523523 its hard not to think hey im a rock star man
8523524 it was years we needed a home and away and it worked out for south carolina too coming out of the box you kind of remember those opening thursday night games throughout the year
8523525 its different when youre training during the summer and youre preparing for a high profile team like that
8523526 you work a little bit harder you push a little bit more so you can prepare yourself for that team
8523527 wir wollen das spiel ernst nehmen und uns qualifizieren wir sind klarer favorit
8523528 das bleibt intern wir k nnen solche sachen nicht akzeptieren das thema ist aber jetzt erledigt
8523529 der trainer hat eine klare ansage gemacht er hat das sagen und macht die aufstellung
8523530 kritik muss zuk nftig intern besprochen werden das hat patrick eingesehen und sich bei der mannschaft entschuldigt
8523531 ich werde drei vier neue spieler bringen ich bin froh dass wir endlich einen konkurrenz kampf im kader haben
8523532 now we just need to take heart from the progress we showed in that game and keep moving forward
8523533 the win over cuba is the perfect start for us as we look ahead to our games with guatemala and then the usa
8523534 getting points on the road in our opener is a terrific boon for our confidence and we will just need to keep it up
8523535 the packets can get routed all the way through new york and then back to pakistan
8523536 you can do anything to it except kill it and it will regenerate

8523546 he has played well but the defense has shut down things so well that we may have given up only five shots or so in four games
8523547 elis performance was the result of nine shots taken in about 40 minutes of playing time limiting his playing time to less than half the game because the opponent was under prepared would have been unfair to a young man who lives to play this game
8523548 that the record i thought would be there when i die has now been broken
8523549 its going to be good in two days im sure
8523550 i was thinking more of it than i was really actually feeling the pain so its not really a big deal

8523553 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8523554 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8523555 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8523556 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8523557 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8523558 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8523559 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8523560 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8523561 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8523562 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8523563 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8523564 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8523565 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8523566 today i made a report rather than hard im always hard
8523567 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8523568 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8523569 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
8523570 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8523571 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8523572 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8523573 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8523574 long long ago it was pc partner that manufactured reference cards for
8523575 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8523576 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8523577 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8523578 it is part of chinas worsening crackdown in the area
8523579 the international community should prevent the chinese government from carrying out their systematic crackdown policies on the uighurs
8523580 its not a final decision it has been recommended to the ioc a final decision will be coming from the ioc
8523581 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8523582 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8523583 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8523584 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8523585 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8523586 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8523587 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8523588 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8523589 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8523590 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8523591 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8523592 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8523593 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8523594 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8523595 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

8523597 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8523598 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8523599 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8523600 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8523601 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
8523602 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
8523603 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
8523604 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
8523605 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
8523606 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
8523607 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
8523608 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
8523609 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

8523612 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8523613 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8523614 we needed a system to develop products that combine editorial and it in an environment where they can develop and test them and the lab creates an experimental environment that we have lacked until now
8523615 it will be used for big projects that are separate from breaking news but allow us to use technology to better showcase our content
8523616 start up companies incentivise their staff in all sorts of ways and a big part of that is the work environment
8523617 theres a temptation with it staff to cram them in large dull offices but if you want to be in the market for smart people you have to give them an interesting environment
8523618 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8523619 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8523620 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8523621 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8523622 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8523623 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

8523632 my perception even as a small child was that this man was doing important work helping kids live healthy happy lives so from a young age medicine and specifically medicine focusing on children seemed a good path something to aspire to
8523633 children and adolescents tend to think of themselves as healthy and they tend not to be concerned about long term health impacts
8523634 i thought of my role as solely to provide good medicine to the children who came through my clinic but as time passed i began to understand that being a pediatrician involved much more than providing good care to patients and sound advice to their parents there were children in my community who for whatever reason were not receiving the medical care physical protection family nurturing and education that would allow them to grow to their full potential as adults i began to understand that to be a truly good pediatrician i must be a good advocate for all children not just those whose parents brought them to the clinic

8523644 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8523645 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8523646 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8523647 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack

8523663 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8523664 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8523665 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8523666 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

8523734 he had a problem for the first game with liege and also when he went away to play for england in their friendly last week against the czech republic
8523735 we talked with the doctor yesterday and today and it was decided that steven would play in this match with the pain but now we will have to get the situation solved

8523799 manchester united a club who i think we can all agree probably needs a somewhat larger squad given their european commitments and their tendency to go far in domestic cup competitions by contrast has just 21 players who are 22 or older
8523800 50 pros what is that all about 50 pros when keane turns up for training he must wonder who half of them are
8523801 nemanja vidic would like to clarify comments attributed to him in several uk newspapers which have either been taken out of context or misquoted read the statement on manutd
8523802 so much was amiss in rafael ben tezs line up there is still no finesse on the flanks and it is a moot point whether the expected signing of albert riera from espanyol will address that concern it was unsettling too to witness steven gerrard in difficulties physically and dropping deeper as the game went on his groin injury will now keep the midfielder out for at least a fortnight
8523803 if playing badly and progressing is the hallmark of champions then liverpool should be backed to claim the quadruple this season while their powers of tenacity and resilience can never be questioned their performances remain stuck in the lowest gear a frailty that came close to removing them from the champions league before the tournament has truly begun a narrow victory more like size zero
8523804 steven gerrard is a patriot but his heart belongs to liverpool that was underlined last night as he put his clubs european ambitions ahead of his countrys world cup hopes gerrard has continued playing in the premier league because there is little alternative with javier mascherano and lucas in china at the olympics and benitez unable to lure gareth barry from aston villa liverpool have been short of central midfielders
8523805 there is a strong chance that celtic among the third group of seeds could be drawn against any of the premier league entrants who will be eager to avoid clubs such as fiorentina and atl tico madrid who are lurking among the lower seeds this evenings draw will be preceded by an awards ceremony from last seasons champions league won by united ferguson is firmly expected to win the coach of the year award and cristiano ronaldo the club footballer of the year while edwin van der sar rio ferdinand paul scholes and ronaldo will be among the favourites to win their respective categories
8523806 its a good job chelsea dont have to reveal the loan details paid by ac milan for the return of one of their most prolific goalscorers andrei shevchenko
8523807 the lack of transfer fee speaks volumes about just how bad a piece of business was his acquisition rivalled only by winston bogarde shevchenko has said that he thanks the fans for their support while at chelsea i should think so
8523808 shaun wright phillips is set to make a dramatic return to manchester city in an 8 5million deal three years after a 22million move to chelsea it is believed the winger who will undergo a medical on thursday has been offered a staggering 80 000 a week deal to go back to eastlands as one of manager mark hughes top targets wright phillips is anxious to move on from chelsea where his first team chances under luiz felipe scolari look extremely limited
8523809 wayne lindsay yesterday appeared to rule out a move to either manchester city or everton both of whom have been heavily linked with the england international in recent days
8523810 sunderlands official website lists 49 members in the first team squad throw in anton ferdinand whose move from west ham is all but sealed and youve got 50 players ok so some of those are youngsters take out the 19 players aged 21 or less even though that includes the likes of anthony stokes who cost around 2 million and youve stil got a whopping 31 senior professionals on sunderlands books let me say that again thirty one manchester united a club who i think we can all agree probably needs a somewhat larger squad given their european commitments and their tendency to go far in domestic cup competitions by contrast has just 21 players who are 22 or older and that includes the likes of dong fangzhuo and manucho both of whom probably have to buy a ticket if they want to get into old trafford on matchdays
8523811 50 pros what is that all about 50 pros when keane turns up for training he must wonder who half of them are the bench at sunderland must stretch halfway to newcastle to accommodate them all what makes it seem all the more peculiar is that keane is not a man you assume who would have difficulty telling someone that their time had come and they needed to move on tough decisions were never something he shirked from in his playing career surely it is part of the job of being a manager is to balance the squad numbers show the door to those you dont want even as you bring in those you do if anyone has any ideas how to remove a player you dont want from the pay roll please post it here and well forward them to the big man himself frankly right now he could do with some suggestions
8523812 are poised to land feyenoords jonathan de guzman for 12million gunners boss arsene wenger has made his move for the tough tackling midfielder 20 who is known as the dutch version of owen hargreaves
8523813 mcguire who represents milner claims newcastle have refused to enter into new contract talks with the midfielder despite the 22 year old earning significantly less than many of the first team squad at st james park he believes that newcastle have failed to reward his development in the past two seasons and responding to a club statement earlier in the day pointed out that the new contract milner signed last summer was agreed almost two years ago after a proposed move to villa was called off at the last minute
8523814 is not being allowed to manage newcastle as he did first time around between 1992 and 1997 his authority is diminished that has seemed less relevant as newcastle recruited fabricio coloccini jonas gutierrez and danny guthrie then made a fine start to the premier league at old trafford and cemented that with victory over bolton wanderers last saturday but throughout the summer and even during these otherwise positive opening two weeks of the season keegan has repeatedly spoken of the need to strengthen the squad with mark viduka out for another month and obafemi martins out of saturdays match at arsenal there could be a temptation to start owen who has made two substitute appearances since his calf strain
8523815 tottenham would clearly have needed to enhance their attacking options regardless of what happens with berbatov but it would appear that pavlyuchenko has been bought as a long term replacement in terms of style and physical size he is similar to berbatov while his preference is also to play as the main focal point in attack during euro 2008 russia tended to use andrei arshavin running off pavlyuchenko in a similar manner to robbie keane and berbatov at tottenham in recent seasons
8523816 tottenham hotspur have told dimitar berbatov that he can leave only if they sign two strikers before the transfer deadline on monday and they hope that the second after roman pavlyuchenko will be andrei arshavin spurs have revived their interest in arshavin whom they now believe they can sign for less than 20m for their part tottenham have told berbatov that they do not regard pavlyuchenkos signing alone as sufficient reason for the bulgarian to leave the club
8523817 once the window shuts on monday night clubs cannot sell one of their players until it opens again on 1 january
8523818 the league cup is like the stalwart old pal you keep in touch with out of habit even though youve both outgrown each other truth be told you wouldnt much notice if you stopped hearing from him it would be hard to see the tournament laid to rest when its been a part of englands football landscape for the best part of half a century and also because it can still produce exciting games as newcastle and coventry showed but if broadly speaking most clubs and fans at all levels cannot be bothered with the competition who does that leave who actually can newcastles desperation for any sort of silverware is no longer justification enough
8523819 at one time hypnosis was all the rage among the managerial fraternity and gareth southgate who rather reassuringly is somewhat uneasy about being called
8523820 in cold terms a defeat to chile would not necessarily mean tragedy for brazils hopes to keep their record as the only nation to take part in every world cup finals there would be still 11 matches to go and even a fifth place finish would give brazil a shot in a repechage against a concacaf side also only four points separate the top five south american teams at the moment with chile in third with 10 teixeira nonetheless has never been shy of wielding the knife in the middle of competitions which is proved by the fact brazil had four managers in the 2002 qualifiers he might just be sharpening the blade as you read

8523890 as it turns out our partners are choosing the latter
8523891 this has led directly to a similarly significant increase in monetizable partner inventory as our video id partners are seeing claimed content more than double their number of views against which we can run ads
8523892 this means that if a partner has say 10 000 views of its content leaving up videos claimed by our system will lead to an average additional 10 000 views of that same content
8523893 these partners now have a new way to successfully distribute and market their content online and with the help of our users they are finding video id critical to discovering such opportunities

8523904 but publishers should not just copy their classic business model into an internet form they have to think beyond the borders of their own industry by collaborating with other industries to form a new cross industry business model
8523905 classic publishers no longer produce just newspapers and magazines but are multimedia houses with television radio and online products
8523906 this way they can maximise revenues during periods when one product becomes more popular than others

8523909 green taxes are set far higher than is necessary to pay for our carbon footprint which loads an unfair burden onto hard pressed british families and businesses
8523910 with the credit crunch squeezing household budgets people can ill afford this extra tax grab its dishonest and unjust for politicians to wrap revenue raising tax hikes in a green banner
8523911 the government are talking about raising taxes even further but our conclusions show that green taxes should be kept as they are or cut
8523912 excessive green taxes hit poorer people hardest hurt the competitiveness of british firms cause britain to export emissions and fall disproportionately on residents of rural and suburban areas
8523913 the taxpayers alliance figures are seriously flawed because they are based on a discredited approach to calculating the cost of
8523914 green taxes are one of the key policies needed to prevent dangerous climate change that would cost the uk billions of pounds and ruin lives
8523915 the government has fuelled public scepticism by failing to use tax breaks and public spending to make it cheaper and easier to go green if green taxes are to work the government must also invest in greener alternatives such as public transport
8523916 the estimate of green taxes is wrong as it includes taxes used to fund core public services rather than simply offsetting the cost of co2

8523939 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8523940 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8523941 urban areas might be dealing with the problem more effectively but in the outlying regions it seems to be getting worse places like newport plymouth st davids stockport
8523942 if you look at liverpool sheffield and bristol the levels are low
8523943 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available

8523958 although we have worked on an infectious disease the same is likely to be true for nk cells in cancer so in practical terms it means that we need to consider more carefully exactly how we use therapies that affect nk cells to maximise their beneficial role
8523959 the road near my house was dug up in october last year for some drainage work however after the work was done the road was left as it is causing problems to residents
8523960 to my amazement within nine days of my filing the application the road was repaired perfectly this is the power of rti
8523961 this was the figure up to december 2007 but now with people becoming aware of rti i suppose the number of people using rti must have gone up
8523962 in june this year mcd was constructing a road near my office in the sunder nagri area but the construction agency was not doing it properly i then filed several applications asking about the details of work carried out and for them to let me inspect the road
8523963 they were using bricks while making the road which should not be done
8523964 they kept asking me what i wanted and why i had filed the rti application they even told me that that they would do anything i wanted if i took back my application
8523965 but i just wanted the road to be made properly and i told them that
8523966 within a few days the road was constructed perfectly rti is a great tool and it really helps a common man to take make the government accountable
8523967 this is true because as soon as people file the rti responsibility gets fixed and officers end up doing the job which otherwise they never do

8523973 we will be sending a clear message to the world that our environmental standards and sovereignty are not up for debate if you are in canadas arctic you will be playing by canadas rules
8523974 as an environmental matter as a security matter and as an economic matter we are making it perfectly clear that not only do we claim jurisdiction over the canadian arctic we are also going to put the full resources of the government of canada behind enforcing that jurisdiction
8523975 we are acting today to protect our environment improve the security of our waterways and ensure that all northern residents and in particular the inuit have a strong say in the future of our arctic for generations to come

8523986 he has shown a clear grasp of our foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8523987 he will choose diplomacy first and military force as a last resort
8523988 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8523989 damiens butterfly series predates his formaldehyde series he held an exhibition in woodstock gallery in london in 1991 where he had put up monochrome canvases on the walls and let loose live butterflies to fly around the hall to match the colours on his canvas
8523990 many of the butterflies died in course of the exhibition and that is what damien wanted he wanted to capture the beautiful but the short life cycle of butterflies
8523991 in 1992 he held an exhibition where animals and butterflies were preserved in formaldehyde
8523992 in 1988 hirst made his spot painting a series of circular coloured dots on a canvas and followed it up with more in 1990 they were part of his pharmaceutical art series through which he tried to drive home the message that people must have more faith in medicines which like art can heal
8523993 we are happy that we could save some of the hostages but also unhappy that three of them were killed
8523994 the first to be brought out was sarita the wife of billu ram she was injured after that his four children were rescued
8523995 later billu rams brother tarsem and his wife ritu were rescued some of the hostages are still in shock
8523996 it was scary we were locked inside a room and the men said they will kill us
8523997 those around successful leaders or the observers in this research do not have difficulty equating supportive leadership behaviour with decisive action to maintain standards above all they appear to admire the combination of the two
8523998 what is clear is that the most admired leaders are highly skilled in the modern areas of leadership but importantly they are also able to set tough standards and achieve results observers want leaders to combine ethical and inspirational behaviour with the ability to take tough business decisions
8523999 modern leadership can no longer be regarded as a soft option this research shows that it is integrity honesty and decisive action that marks out the truly successful leaders their followers have no problem equating ethics and discipline and neither should we leaders in all fields from business to sport to politics cannot escape the need to adapt to this new firm but fair style of leadership not if they want to remain at the top
8524000 that the record i thought would be there when i die has now been broken
8524001 it wasnt a good performance but we always know we have the quality to score
8524002 ive kind of been texting him back and forth and hes doing great and wife lucy is doing great
8524003 anybody who has a child is excited i think no matter what the gender is they are thrilled
8524004 the thing that people really want when you get down to it is a healthy child
8524005 we cant continue to have the same tired plays being run from the same tired playbook
8524006 john mccain is my friend biden repeatedly argued that mccain would bring
8524007 is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8524008 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8524009 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need
8524010 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8524011 ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8524012 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and country lets declare together in one voice right here and right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8524013 i move that sen barack obama of illinois be selected by this convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party for president of the united states
8524014 never did i think we would be able to position ourselves to nominate an african american as president of the united states
8524015 i did not think it would happen in my lifetime
8524016 i thought he meant a few million dollars he told me he could compete i thought he meant two or three states
8524017 on navait pas fait deffort financier quivalent depuis la mise en place de la couverture maladie universelle cmu
8524018 tout ce qui a t racont sur le rsa depuis trois mois est faux
8524019 nous navons pas de rsa au rabais puisque cest la fourchette haute du financement qui a t retenue la prime pour lemploi a t maintenue le projet na pas t report puisquil entre en application la mi 2009
8524020 weve seen some pretty egregious examples that dont fit a misdemeanor
8524021 we want to make sure that we dont make it so hostile to potential candidates that we cant get people to run for office
8524022 and we also want to make sure we dont create felony penalties for everything so that weve got so many in prison for campaign finance violations that we dont have room for people who commit violent crimes
8524023 the indictments and convictions will continue until either the leadership of the general assembly decides to change the culture of the institution or voters adopt a throw the bums out mentality
8524024 i dont think its in the states interests to extend the time of his incarceration
8524025 it was impossible to win based on the instructions the jury was given
8524026 prudence would dictate that we leave the text as it is until our candidate catches up with us
8524027 i want to give him a platform he can run on
8524028 i dont want to stick my finger in his eye
8524029 ive been running for president for 19 months which explains the gray hair
8524030 it has showed up a little bit more especially in the past year
8524031 we need to level the playing field for families around here washington stopped working because the special interests just have too much power oil companies getting tax breaks while we get record gas prices local jobs shipped overseas and the big corporations and ceos keep getting rewarded while north carolina gets left behind im kay hagan and no one can promise theyll change things overnight but i approve this message with a pledge to begin leveling the playing field because its time we got started
8524032 that was part of their history and it helps me understand the gravity and significance of what were doing right now
8524033 im excited that so many people are able to see his intelligence and ability
8524034 what it does is give another image another powerful stereotype almost to counteract a lot of those other images
8524035 my level of pride in him would have been the same regardless of his race
8524036 my fear is that people will say were done meaning that the conversation about race about those disparities will stop because we have a black president
8524037 i live really close to the beach and so always like to play in the sea i am also learning to sail at the sailing club nearby and we went to visit the local rnli royal national lifeboat institution to find out more about how to be safe in the water we had to learn how to capsize and practice pulling our boat back up it was a bit scary to start with but once wed done it the first time it was easier ive never seen anyone rescued by the rnli but i have seen it on tv and we have a safety boat at the sailing club but it is not as high tech as the real ones we were shown around by the man who looks after the lifeboat station lifeboat people dont work there all the time as they are volunteers they do other jobs but then they might just get an emergency call and they have to leave work and rush to the lifeboat first we saw the smaller lifeboat it is called a rib it has a small steering wheel and engine and cannot fit many people in it they keep it in a hut and can pull it up the beach the main selsey lifeboat is much bigger and deeper than i thought and you can go down below in it to see where they steer there are loads of dials and controls and a bigger steering wheel it takes only about three seconds for the boat to go down the ramp and into the sea but when they come back from rescuing someone it takes about 20 minutes to winch it back up different sizes we also went into the changing room where all the lifeboat volunteers rush to when there is an emergency there were lots of pegs with names on where all their wetsuits and clothes are hanging they have woolly under linings and then dry suits to put on and then jackets and boots which they have to put on really quickly it was funny to see lots of different size suits all hanging up as some of the lifeboat men are big but one of the womens suits was much smaller it was really good to see the proper lifeboats and it is good to know they are there if you ever get into trouble when you are sailing all you have to do is call 999 like when you need an ambulance my tips for being safe when you sail or play in the water are to always wear a buoyancy aid lifejacket and if you capsize you need to stay near to your boat so that the lifeboat people can see you easily
8524038 we had a chance to elect the first african american statewide in north carolina and we came that close and fell short
8524039 showed that race is something you can transcend and i think barack obama has done that
8524040 edwards was only unfaithful to his wife lieberman was unfaithful to an entire party
8524041 kay hagan does not represent the values of this state she is a trojan horse for a long list of wacky left wing outside groups bent on policies that would horrify most north carolinians if they knew about it
8524042 this is a desperate attempt to distract from the simple fact that its elizabeth dole whos out of touch with north carolinians
8524043 becoming an ias is the ultimate dream of thousands of students though hard work is the key to success in ias the right preparation strategy can make a lot of difference through these sessions we will teach the aspirants on how to organize better to maximize chances of success in the most prestigious examination of india
8524044 we appreciate the efforts of wiziq to boost the culture of e learning in india thereby providing a wider range of options to the students in far flung areas
8524045 i have done what i thought was right to protect the safety of the public on our highways
8524046 it will be the members of the general assembly who will have on their hands the consequences of this law i hope and pray no one gets hurt
8524047 we can get no documentation that says anything that has occurred in the past has proven to us that it is dangerous
8524048 these guys are supposed to be on the same side and on a relatively non controversial piece of legislation easley becomes the first governor to have a veto overridden in north carolina history
8524049 were making an exclusion for a small group of people
8524050 when the u s department of defense wants to transport equipment over 8 feet wide they have to apply for a permit when the forest service wants to move bulldozers and equipment to work in areas throughout the state they have to apply for permits just like any agency or any business
8524051 i felt like today the governor saw a mistake that we made by voting for this
8524052 a lot of people try to bring boats that have no business being trailered down these narrow highways to the outer banks
8524053 ive been doing this for 30 years and never had an accident
8524054 one reason we dont have accidents is that when youre towing something like that you know youve got something big behind you and youre more careful going down the road
8524055 this was an odd piece of legislation for the governor to stand on but after the past eight years im not surprised
8524056 this is the most expensive governor initiated session of his term
8524057 we have bridges in north carolina where two cars cant cross at the same time
8524058 and we are set to go to all the 16 districts of buganda
8524059 the fdc only wants baganda youths when there is teargas in the city
8524060 there was not a single member of the press when we met him how did the electronic media start broadcasting that we apologised
8524061 it was that wrong impression created by the various media reports that has prompted us to go all over buganda and tell it at public rallies that we still stand by what we told him
8524062 her views happen to be similar to ours but she is not really linked to our present activities
8524063 if anyone doubts my motivation they can be sure of this i want to win now more than ever
8524064 the truth is in a couple of races hungary and germany i made some mistakes that relegated me to sixth place while in valencia i missed out on third place by a hairs breadth
8524065 whats happened has happened theres no use crying about it
8524066 well go there next weekend i love that circuit id love to race there all year long
8524067 with india we will build on the close partnership developed over the past decade
8524068 as two of the worlds great multi ethnic democracies the us and india are natural strategic allies and we must work together to advance our common interests and to combat the common threats of the 21st century
8524069 throughout my life i have always looked to mahatma gandhi as an inspiration because he embodies the kind of transformational change that can be made when ordinary people come together to do extraordinary things
8524070 that is why his portrait hangs in my senate office to remind me that real results will come not just from washington they will come from the people
8524071 change is always tough and electing me is change and it means that people are going to hesitate a little bit
8524072 not only do i think im a desi but im a desi
8524073 indians and pakistanis came together under one roof to cause havoc in the university
8524074 those are friendships which have lasted for years and continue until this day
8524075 i have an enormous personal affection for the people of south asia
8524076 ive also had an orientation toward asia and a recognition that over time we are going to see more economic growth and an economic partnership with the united states that is strategic
8524077 credo che sheva si sentir bene al milan lui ha sempre fatto bene a san siro
8524078 sono daccordo segnale di grande fiducia ho limpressione che qualcosa stia cambiando daltronde anche a s siro ho visto tantissimi tifosi della roma ci sono le aspettative giuste da parte di tutti
8524079 questanno anche la juve ha un ottimo organico ce il milan che non gioca la champions e in piu ho visto due grandi squadre in supercoppa e la roma e ancora in ritardo di preparazione senza totti e senza esterni di ruolo se esiste si trata di una differenza minima
8524080 la roma ha sofferto molto gli inserimenti di un maicon straripante baptista tornava poco e riise doveva badare anche a figo
8524081 in abercromby street where my practice is the average male life expectancy is about 53 years old
8524082 there is a high incidence of mental illness like depression which leads to a number of organic problems
8524083 its not surprising that we see more cases of heart disease stroke diabetes asthma and bronchitis than areas like lenzie
8524084 one of the postal sectors here has the lowest income in the uk
8524085 that means people have less money to spend on basics like food clothes and travel to work
8524086 this is made worse by other social problems like poor housing and community safety
8524087 the area also has serious problems with gang and knife culture and of course drug and alcohol abuse which are colossal contributors to early death
8524088 over the last two or three years weve had more and more patients asking for help to stop smoking
8524089 thats great and we do all we can to help but there are other things which government can do
8524090 in recent times we have dealt with advertising of cigarettes and then with smoking in public places
8524091 but i believe that advertising for alcohol and junk food should also be tackled
8524092 tutto fatto c laccordo con il monaco e c laccordo con il giocatore
8524093 this is the time of the year that hurricane premiums can be put into the market 10 to 15 a barrel
8524094 there is the labour day holiday on monday and the market will be shut theres a lot of nervousness in the market
8524095 diese regionen haben sich als sehr effizient im umgang mit ihrem kapital gezeigt das ist etwas wovon wir bei siemens profitieren k nnen
8524096 bei dem schwachen handel den wir im moment haben ist es f r den nikkei schwierig ber die 12 900 hinauszukommen
8524097 solange die ausl ndischen investoren die am tokioter markt etwa 70 prozent des handels ausmachen sich nicht bewegen solange bewegt sich auch der markt nicht
8524098 die investoren kommen voraussichtlich nicht mehr zur ck bevor kein ende der us kreditsorgen und der weltweiten konjunkturellen abschw chung abzusehen ist
8524099 ho avuto modo di vedere allopera gli azzurri in tv nella partita dandata contro il vllaznia e ho constatato che rispetto alla scorsa stagione sul piano tattico cambiato poco quasi nulla limpostazione sempre la stessa forse lunica novit o meglio nota lieta laggiunta nello scacchiere tattico di denis che rispetto agli attaccanti che aveva il napoli nella scorsa stagione tende di pi a venire incontro ai portatori di palla quindi una punta mobile far certamente bene un attaccante moderno non un vero ariete
8524100 contro gli albanesi non ho visto un reparto particolarmente in difficolt ritengo che ci siano giocatori capaci di risolverti le partite in ogni momento poi se proprio volessimo trovare il pelo nelluovo si potrebbe cercare unalternativa a vitale magari un giocatore pi esperto dello stabiese non guastarebbe
8524101 nonostante il risultato nettamente a favore degli azzurri credo che sar gara certamente vera nella quale gli albanesi lotteranno su ogni pallone anche perch si troveranno a giocare in uno stadio molto pi grande del loro impianto e quindi tenderanno a dare il massimo
8524102 sicuramente il ritiro nel corso di una stagione calcistica fondamentale sia sul piano fisico che sullla formazione del gruppo i giocatori hanno modo diconoscersi e capire pregi e difetti dei proprio compagni
8524103 vi posso assicurare che svolgere le sedute atletiche di mister zeman era una fatica disumana eravamo sottoposti ad un lavoro terribile le gradinate dello zaccheria credo siano consumate per il numero di volte che salivamo e scendevamo la tribuna del campo pugliese non ho fatto mai cosi tanti balzi nella mia carriera lesercizio pi massacrante erano le ripetute sui mille metri che dovevamo percorrere in meno di quattro minuti la sua era una mentalit vincente alla fine dovevamo segnare un gol in pi agli altri questo era il suo dictat anche nelle partite dove eravamo avanti gi di parecchie reti ci chiedeva sempre di spingere al massimo altrimenti ci distruggeva durante la settimana per alla fine uscivamo da tutti gli stadi a testa alta belle soddisfazioni abbiamo raccolto
8524104 napoli una piazza esigente siete stati abituati per troppo tempo a grandi risultati e perdere consecutivamente 3 4 gare allinizio del campionato per voi una cosa inconcepibile zeman un tecnico che ha bisogno di tempo per applicare al meglio la sua mentalit di gioco putroppo il duo ferlaino corbelli non lo fu dello stesso parere anche a foggia in serie b era partito malissimo alla fine del girone di andata eravamo ultimi forse anche perch risentivamo dei suoi carichi di lavoro ma credetemi nel girone di ritorno eravamo delle saette in campo per pochi punti non conquistammo la promozione diretta
8524105 sicuramente ciccio baiano nella foto tecnicamente era un gradino superiore a tutti quanti noi del gruppo di zemanlandia in allenamento era quasi unutopia togliergli la palla putroppo seri infortuni gli hanno condizionato non poco la carriera col tempo sono sbocciati altri talenti come beppe signori rambaudi shalimov padalino gente che ne ha fatta di strada
8524106 un allenatore che ha alle spalle una carriera da calciatore secondo me parte gi meglio rispetto a tecnici senza esperienza diretta del campo di gioco sono nettamente avantaggiati lesperienza ti riesce a farti capire i problemi di collocazione di un giocatore ti agevolano sul discorso interpersonale anche se per ci sono alcuni sporadici casi che smentiscono la mia tesi lesempio di arrigo sacchi lesempio pi lampante ma credo rester una rarit
8524107 lothar mattheus un giocatore universale poteva giocare in tutti i ruoli ha iniziato la sua carriera come punta poi lo hanno adattato regista ed infine ha chiuso la sua eccezionale carriera come difensore centrale davvero fortissimo
8524108 lanzafame e russotto faranno grandissime cose in serie a il primo un ragazzo molto valido e gi disciplinato tatticamente credo si ritaglier il giusto spazio a palermo russotto invece un ottimo elemento il classico trequartista dotato tecnicamente e capace di svariare da una parte allaltra del campo con una velocit invidiabile ha dei colpi da fuoriclasse
8524109 gilardino sicuramente ritorner con prandelli ad esprimersi ai livelli di parma a mio avviso ha fatto bene anche a milano purtroppo non gli stata concessa la giusta continuit per questo non si espresso a grandi livelli
8524110 if i left that amount of domestic waste on the street for four days i could quite properly be charged with obstructing the highway and leaving litter
8524111 in my opinion city council staff have left litter and obstructed the highway
8524112 our rubbish can stink for a fortnight in our back yards and on this occasion for a further four days on the street its an appalling service
8524113 the city council claims to provide a kerbside collection of domestic refuse and specified recyclables this should mean from the pavement outside each house and the return of these to the same place
8524114 unfortunately on this occasion staff pulled out the boxes without realising the vehicle could not gain access
8524115 staff would normally return the boxes once they had been emptied and in this instance staff should not have left the boxes in the road
8524116 the last thing he said to me was have i told you i love you today thursday 28 august and i said no you havent he said i love you and that was the last i saw of him
8524117 i cant understand why he has gone he is a doting father it must have been something awful for him to leave his children
8524118 it was the anniversary of his fathers death on wednesday he died a year ago a day after his 63rd birthday terry took it very hard they were very close i think terry is in a vulnerable state we just want him home whatever it is we can sort it out
8524119 please come home terry i love you and i miss you and the kids miss you
8524120 we are growing increasingly concerned about terry as this is completely out of character
8524121 i would ask anyone who think they know where he is to tell us or his family and to terry please get in touch with your family as they are worried about you and would like to know that you are ok
8524122 our goal is to make vuescan the universal scanning application we now support 1200 scanners on windows 750 on mac os x and 580 scanners on linux
8524123 our next goal is to add more advanced scanning features such as scanning multiple photos placed randomly on a scanner auto image segmentation and integrating googles optical character recognition ocr code all of these advanced scanning features will work with all of the 1200 supported scanners in all 24 languages on all three operating systems a truly universal scanning application
8524124 it was dreadful i saw these two men coming towards me after i had just made a delivery in wrights grove which is a cul de sac
8524125 they were wearing hoods over their faces and came towards me carrying milk bottles in their hands
8524126 i think its terrible in all my 40 years as a milkman i have never had anything like this happen to me
8524127 david is a brave lad hes back at work but we did send someone out with him his first day back
8524128 i couldnt believe it on saturday i got a call from a woman in norfolk who said she had my milk float sitting outside her house
8524129 i had to go up and collect it which took me four hours there and back
8524130 one was a robbery by a group of youths it was very intimidating and frightening for the milkman who later left the job my son runs our dairy in haverhill and some youths stole a float and rolled it down a hill the job is getting more risky
8524131 it is getting out of hand another of my milkmen had a sword pulled on him in mill road in cambridge in may the man said he would cut him up

8524140 its definitely going to be a challenge were definitely going to get tested deep
8524141 theyre going to bring more speed to the table theyre going to try to stretch the field a little bit and once they stretch it enough theyre going to trying to cut it back and hit the crease
8524142 when youre playing gap defense youre playing about eight gaps and you have to have every gap accounted for or theyre going to get you for a big gain

8524164 for a generation certain evangelical teachers have told us that the gifts of the spirit ceased at the death of the apostles or at the completion of the new testament this of course is a doctrine without a syllable of biblical authority back of it the result of this erroneous teaching is that spiritually gifted persons are ominously few among us this frightening hour calls aloud for men with the gift of prophetic insight instead we have men who conduct surveys polls and panel discussions we need men with the gift of knowledge in their place we have men with scholarship nothing more thus we may be preparing ourselves for the tragic hour when god may set us aside as so called evangelicals and raise up another movement to keep new testament christianity alive in the earth the truth of the matter is that the scriptures plainly imply the imperative of possessing the gifts of the spirit but i must also add a word of caution the various spiritual gifts are not equally valuable as paul so carefully explains certain brethren have magnified one gift out of seventeen out of all proportion among these brethren there have been and are many godly souls but the general moral results of this teaching have nevertheless not been good in practice it has resulted in much shameless exhibitionism a tendency to depend upon experiences instead of upon christ and often a lack of ability to distinguish the works of the flesh from the operations of the spirit those who deny that the gifts are for us today and those who insist upon making a hobby of one gift are both wrong and we are all suffering the consequences of their error

8524196 the open air obama acceptance speech is one of the biggest and possibly craziest gambles of this or any other presidential campaign of the modern era

8524200 it was a pleasure to stay in this beautiful and modern apartment with the warm welcome i got from local moroccan host the pc with internet was amazing bcos i was able to run my business while away and thanks to the satellite tv i got to watch news sport from back home as well as lots of amazing arabic music videos ill be back next year
8524201 the van was carrying policemen and jail staff when it was hit by an explosives laden car which was used in the attack

8524210 i know that most of the red cards are in the custody of pds shop owners these cards ought to be returned immediately to the cardholders the beneficiaries should be given their due share i will be going to the villages and talk to the cardholders the erring shop owners will immediately be put behind the bars

8524212 since the first cases of hiv surfaced in the late 1970s and early 80s there has been no cure for the hiv pandemic
8524213 it tells us that our efforts must go on further and further
8524214 an enhanced and effective response to hiv in asia and the pacific which ensures equal access to services for all persons regardless of their age sexual orientation or gender
8524215 countries must clearly identify their priorities and effectively allocate their resources if they expect to maintain a financially sustainable response to the hiv epidemics in the region
8524216 negrita in attesa delluscita seguite le fasi di lavorazione del loro nuovo album su current
8524217 btw obama is now officially the democratic candidate for the presidency of the united
8524218 the ministers welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations between asean australia and new zealand
8524219 it took a long time understanding the sensitivities of all the countries within the asean and for the asean countries to understand indias sensitivities
8524220 so the potential for enhanced economic engagement between asean and india is profound
8524221 will pave the way for greater and closer economic partnership and cooperation in the future
8524222 of course were going to discuss it that doesnt mean were going to force people to recognise
8524223 now that taekondo as a game has fetched nigeria a medal at the olympics the private sector will now want to identify and invest in the game we will continue to invest in the federation so that the game becomes a house hold name in the country
8524224 we would never claim that what we study in mice directly relates to how antidepressants work in humans but there are interesting features in parallel
8524225 the study unifies different observations that point to the brains dentate gyrus region and to creation of nerve cells as being important in depression
8524226 at least in mice this result directly links antidepressants and voluntary exercise with trkb mediated creation of nerve cells
8524227 we can get biochemical physiological behavioral and anatomical results in animal models
8524228 these all resonate with the human condition so perhaps you have a physiological relevancy
8524229 there could be a way to stimulate growth of nerve cells to fight depression for example

8524262 turn on the tv and what do i see a pageantry of empty gestures all lined up for me
8524263 thats a reference to our current president who i very publicly despise
8524264 i just cant stand the guy or his administration and it was about him going to the graveside of martin luther king one of my heroes and i think desecrating the memory of that great man and his work by being there during the iraq war
8524265 i found it pathetic so i wrote that song about it

8524281 councils will naturally wish to ensure that council tax discounts and benefits are not wrongly claimed
8524282 the fact such snooping is already over used by local authorities bodes ill for the planned powers for town halls to access communications data there are insufficient checks and balances to prevent peoples sex lives being habitually monitored by state bureaucrats purely because they claim a council tax discount for living alone
8524283 millions of pounds are being ripped off from the taxpayer by a minority of people who deliberately cheat the system by claiming discounts
8524284 councils are clamping down hard on fraudsters who pretend to live alone when there are actually more people living in a house and try cheating the tax payer
8524285 pretending to live alone to defraud the taxpayer is not a victimless offence

8524287 knows the law so getting in the car is going to be difficult
8524288 first the presence of several air fresheners commonly used to mask the smell of narcotics hanging in the mercedes
8524289 the prior traffic stop of the mercedes in a drug trafficking area branchs evident nervousness the presence of air fresheners and the fact that branch was driving a car not registered to him these factors in combination could form the basis for a reasonable suspicion of narcotics trafficking
8524290 a seizure that is justified solely by the interest in issuing a warning ticket to the driver can become unlawful if it is prolonged beyond the time reasonably required to complete that mission
8524291 in sum there is insufficient evidence to establish the presence of air fresheners and at the very least there was evidence that called into question officer whites wavering testimony in this regard given that most people are nervous when pulled over by police officers officer whites observation that the defendant seemed nervous in conjunction with the defendants reputation as a drug dealer does not in my opinion rise to the level of reasonable articulable suspicion that would justify a thirty minute detention during a routine traffic incident

8524298 it was a great time and i highly recommend political vindication radio for anyone interested in some solid political talk radio
8524299 i enjoyed the show thoroughly frank and shane are solid hosts and asked some questions that i really enjoyed answering
8524300 that was so much fun and i have to say you guys are real pros almost intimidating youre so good at it
8524301 let me say it was a pleasure to talk to you guys and be asked such important and intelligent questions

8524306 it makes me more proud im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8524307 but when its calvin klein and its fashion photographer steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
8524308 one of the big misconceptions about me is that i walk around in miniskirts and high heels 24 seven and go to the gym in heels
8524309 when people see me dressed normally they cant believe it its really weird
8524310 shes that side of me that was afraid of rejection that was afraid to take a chance and step up and have someone say no you dont get the role
8524311 i do still have that side of me that soft sensitive side and i think that carmen is the more aggressive part of me there are moments when i am so that little girl from cincinnati ohio and i cry and im just like everybody else

8524445 against the backdrop of the drumbeat of negative news of the last several weeks it was encouraging to see a little bit of positive news the basic fact of the matter is that although the economy has been weak it hasnt fallen off a cliff
8524446 the weakness in the dollar and the strength in u s exports are acting like a bit of an automatic stabilizer for the u s economy
8524447 its a key offset at a time when other things are not so good

8524490 the board has no evidence at this stage of its investigation that dr kossmanns practice of medicine within the terms of the undertaking poses a risk to the health and safety of the public the statement said
8524491 i am delighted the medical practitioners board of victoria has allowed me to continue practising as an orthopaedic surgeon dr kossmann said in a statement
8524492 i have given the undertaking to perform spinal or pelvic surgery under supervision pending the outcome of the boards investigation
8524493 i would like to reiterate i totally reject the flawed findings of the alfred hospital peer review and i see the boards decision as a positive step in fully restoring my professional reputation
8524494 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
8524495 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
8524496 its certainly left a bitter taste in my mouth prof kilpatrick said
8524497 i guess at the end of the day its just one of those things but it just reflects really on the lack of community spirit some people have
8524498 time that would have been spent by my team on research will now have to be spent coordinating all that data and putting it back together he said
8524499 i guess im mostly just happy that it happened during the day when no one was home i have two young children and the worst thing would be is if my wife and young children were at home when something like this happened prof kilpatrick said
8524500 honest who comes across it to make sure it gets back to its rightful owner
8524501 it was not divided in any way by anybody either by which quarterback to go after or whether to do it
8524502 with well things would bother him but he never erupted
8524503 thats not the way he was hed ponder things and think things over there were a lot of times when he didnt say much at three or four in the afternoon but hed go home ponder it and take up a stronger position the next morning he was the opposite of someone who was impulsive
8524504 i thought it was going to the gap because it was toward the big part of the yard
8524505 it was one of those ones where as soon as he hit it you knew it was gone
8524506 its definitely nice to give those back end guys some rest
8524507 they threw yesterday and did a good job and its nice especially this late in the year not to abuse them
8524508 hes the energizer bunny of this team he always seems to start things up theres not too many guys who can slice the ball over first base and then come back and get a grand slam
8524509 i dont think anybodys just content with winning these two games
8524510 were definitely going to come out tomorrow and play as hard as we can hopefully we can win that game too theres only 30 games left so were trying to win as many as we can
8524511 op 1 september treedt het koninklijk besluit in werking waardoor vermiste personen administratief als dusdanig te herkennen zijn
8524512 when they put an x next to your name is when youve run out of days
8524513 its not for lack of effort we still have baseball left ive said all along i believe in this team weve had two games that havent went the way we wanted it to
8524514 its not where you want to be but no hole is too deep to climb out of
8524515 we still have 30 games to go were a much better team than weve shown all year
8524516 software application testing is an incredibly dynamic field and we are seeing significant changes and advances regularly
8524517 utests model could very well be indicative of where the future of software testing services are headed with pressures surrounding faster time to market customer control of testing environments and rapidly remediating application defects it makes sense to provide a saas based on demand model to effectively address these concerns
8524518 the real time real world reports from the utester community provide us with accurate and specific feedback we can turn into actionable business items we are now able to focus on areas of the applications that need improvement pinpoint our development efforts and significantly improve product quality and overall customer satisfaction
8524519 as an agile development shop we now see a noticeable increase in our products quality due to utest
8524520 we have a vast increase in testing volume and browser system coverage which gives us confidence when we release our systems to production utest has allowed us to increase our test coverage while decreasing the amount of bugs man power time and money spent on testing
8524521 there are approximately 75 000 professional testers worldwide and we are honored that 10 percent to date have joined our community
8524522 we already have a healthy and growing customer roster of large and mid tier corporations as well as innovative start ups adopting our services the fact that every utest customer is available as a reference and that we are receiving excellent feedback on the quality of our testing platform and the professionalism of our testing community continues to validate the need and cost effectiveness of our business value to the software development marketplace
8524523 theres definitely a very good chance that all of them could stay
8524524 it will be an adjustment but it should be a good thing because the last couple of years i really got worn out toward the end of the season
8524525 i mean that was a freak accident nobody even touched him its just something that happened
8524526 but i dont want to see nobody get hurt obviously weve already had enough injuries were good
8524527 and well pick and choose a little bit on that as well
8524528 its just the fourth preseason game why would there be any emotion from us
8524529 im going to laugh we won i can laugh we got the last laugh
8524530 its definitely going to be a challenge were definitely going to get tested deep
8524531 theyre going to bring more speed to the table theyre going to try to stretch the field a little bit and once they stretch it enough theyre going to trying to cut it back and hit the crease
8524532 when youre playing gap defense youre playing about eight gaps and you have to have every gap accounted for or theyre going to get you for a big gain
8524533 it was just to put those guys in situations saying hey look somebodys going to test you so you may as well go against our guys because it wont be much tougher
8524534 and you dont know the extent of it so it scares you when the ambulance comes we know hes in good hands
8524535 everyone that we play for some reason always has a countdown clock to when theyll play the university of miami
8524536 everyone its part of being at miami you have a target on you but you know what these guys understand on this football team that we went through a lot last year we understand what losing is and we understand not to take opponents lightly
8524537 i will never forget the look on the faces of the syracuse players and the fans in the carrier dome
8524538 thats one good thing about playing on thursday night especially this thursday night the first one everybody that doesnt want to watch politics can watch football
8524539 it was a great win for us and the program it got us some national standing because everybody was saying whos n c state we were total underdogs but we ended up winning
8524540 its hard not to think hey im a rock star man
8524541 it was years we needed a home and away and it worked out for south carolina too coming out of the box you kind of remember those opening thursday night games throughout the year
8524542 its different when youre training during the summer and youre preparing for a high profile team like that
8524543 you work a little bit harder you push a little bit more so you can prepare yourself for that team
8524544 hes done a great job improving his game and becoming a better thrower coach skip holtz said
8524545 hes become a great leader become vocal he knows his role has taken it and run with it
8524546 ive worked extra hard ive watched more film my arms gotten stronger
8524547 secondly i told him to play within himself within the system he doesnt have to win the game by himself
8524548 the last couple of years its been shouldve couldve wouldve
8524549 i want to lead this team and at the end of the year i want my teammates to tell me i had a great year and played hard
8524550 i think it really makes duke formidable the perception that he is the ultimate coach in college basketball and what an honor it would be just to have him come into your home much less have your kid play for him
8524551 he krzyzewski never viewed it as a negative in any way
8524552 the exposure the team had and all the people all over the country who saw what he was able to do with the best players in the country those are all positives for the program
8524553 now i think he has a chip in the game that no one else has
8524554 i believe it is going to exponentially increase his prowess on the recruiting trail
8524555 what happened on sunday was a big deal and its going to continue to be seen that way around the country
8524556 if he can take those nba guys and make them great im sure recruits will think hey he could do that for me
8524557 you know what for what he did for basketball in our country he deserves a recruiting boost for what he did
8524558 chris looks good back there wide receiver was not his position
8524559 he covers our guys comes up makes tackles at the line of scrimmage he runs 4 3 seconds in the 40 yard dash hes a good looking athlete back there
8524560 we told him he could play what he wanted to
8524561 we were going to give him a chance and that helped us get him
8524562 if somebody doesnt go to the final four during their four years at duke then thats too darn bad
8524563 what we didnt go to the final four we didnt win the national championship theyre very spoiled
8524564 it ruins it a little bit really a lot because of that sometimes when you win youre just relieved im not saying that that happens all the time but it happens
8524565 at the end of that spain game when most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated i was euphoric it was the way it should be and thats the way its going to be for me for the rest of my career at duke
8524566 theres no way i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach
8524567 im a better coach to them and a better person as a result we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason
8524568 not something crazy just to spend my time there in the offseason i dont know too much about it my friend is helping me out thats one of my favorite things off of the field in the offseason listening to music listening to reggaeton ive got a couple of songs too
8524569 before it gets close to spring training im going to go home thats where i work out back in the dominican its kind of too cold here ive got to get ready for spring training
8524570 i think scary is probably a good word for it
8524571 ive had some sleepless nights thinking about all kinds of stuff you generally think the worst
8524572 that was the first day he mentioned having anything of any substance
8524573 were trying to figure out whats causing it and go from there
8524574 right now its just day to day and im dealing with it we have a great medical staff were trying to be cautious were not talking about just the end of a season but about the end of a career some organizations would do anything they could to get a player back out there i appreciate what they are doing for me here
8524575 we monitor him every day and do whats in his best interests
8524576 we want him to pitch worry free this is a guy we rely on not just for friday but for a lot of fridays to come
8524577 its something ive been able to use more than just a show me pitch
8524578 im throwing it behind in the count for strikes ive led people off with it throwing it for strikes and it hasnt left the park i think its something thats helped me against lefthanders being a righthanded sidearmer at times you get a lineup full of lefthanders every time i take the mound its nice to not feel so naked out there when theres all these lefties coming up to the plate
8524579 if there is a chance for him to go on the dl were not going to do it yet
8524580 general manager theo epstein and i kind of talked through that today a little bit wed rather not i think with a stiff neck we feel like theres more of an opportunity for him to show up and feel better than with a back so were going to hold off on that one
8524581 the stuff can be dynamite with three pitches that can be dominating we look at last night he threw two pitches by pudge rodriguez they were 96 one might have been 97 pretty good location off the plate i know johnny had hit a couple home runs but if he hit a home run it didnt matter we had the lead sometimes its a work in progress
8524582 it would take 10 seconds they have the ability to look at a replay just like everybody in the clubhouse does it would be over and it would be a great teaching tool for younger umpires that come in the league give some umpires days off as they get into the grind they can watch what were watching they put up with nine innings of us screaming maybe were wrong maybe theres days we have a point
8524583 kotsay is still a plus defender we feel in center and in right
8524584 i know its an overused clich but he is a gamer the type of guy you want the ball hit to in a big spot you want up in a big spot we hope j d s not out too long but if he is itll be nice to have mark on the roster to help fill that void
8524585 im just anxious to come over and in some way help this club obviously reach its destination
8524586 and at the same time have as much fun as possible its very invigorating no question unfortunately in atlanta things didnt go as well as we would have liked i see atlanta giving me this opportunity and we have to be thankful for that
8524587 the best right fielder i ever saw cut a ball off as accurate an arm as possible
8524588 obviously its not the first and foremost choice to go out and play first base
8524589 but whatever im asked to do ill go out and give 100 percent and definitely work on it if im not as good as they want me to be ill get better
8524590 the one thing ive heard from numerous people is if he can walk hell play
8524591 for me i mean the respect of your peers is ultimately what you play the game for and really nothing else
8524592 theres no accolades that im chasing at this point other than to be on a winning club and to play in a world series
8524593 weve had some injuries j d drew and losing mike lowell and tim wakefield for a little bit josh beckett skipped a start
8524594 those are huge players on this team i feel like this teams kind of answered that this team has a lot of character
8524595 i dont think anybodys just content with winning these two games
8524596 were definitely going to come out tomorrow and play as hard as we can hopefully we can win that game too theres only 30 games left were trying to win as many as we can
8524597 i was nervous and i was supposed to be in charge
8524598 thats kind of part of the reason you work your whole life to get in these situations you ought to enjoy it
8524599 its kind of been that way since i got here
8524600 the whole month ive been here has kind of been a red sox yankees series for me its kind of going out there every game every win is crucial all of a sudden you come into this scenario and i feel like ive been in this scenario for a month from where im coming from and i think that kind of equipped me better to handle that
8524601 when the righteous truth from his righteousness and committed iniquity he shall even die thereby but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby

8524605 the native wisteria often grown as an ornamental because of its purple flowers could be ideal as it has already adapted to australian conditions and will tolerate drought frost and salty soils meaning it could be grown in many areas prof gresshoff said
8524606 gum trees are also being looked at as a possible source of biofuel
8524607 mike jubow who runs the nunyara forest nursery at mackay has been importing seeds for the so called diesel tree copaifera langsdorfil from brazil for two years
8524608 another import being considered is the jatropha a drought resistant shrub being cultivated by bp as a biofuel in india southern africa and south east asia but mr jubow said the toxic plant nicknamed the bellyache bush should be kept out of australia it has already been declared a weed in queensland another plant with biofuel potential but also regarded as a weed risk is euphorbia lathyris or caper spurge
8524609 that the record i thought would be there when i die has now been broken
8524610 that is sort of the major achievement or milestone that we all had to reach
8524611 id like to hear and i would love to be a member of the research team or community that does define an efficacious therapy but i think it needs to be approached with enormous caution

8524635 with brad it doesnt matter whether hes in the quarterback meeting room or not hes going to know that stuff thats how brad is wired
8524636 i think it being a former quarterback has real value when you understand the read progressions and how the route is going to unfold it gives you a different level of understanding hes worked at learning coverages now you understand why theyre playing the coverage where the weakness is
8524637 route running body positioning understanding the coverages its different from the quarterback spot and wide receiver spot to be able to read coverages
8524638 it learning is gradual im picking up things as i go this whole year im looking at as a challenge to myself to improve on a lot of things and make plays but to me it ultimately comes to having fun and being a football player im excited about where i am and where im going

8524643 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8524644 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8524645 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer

8524652 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth

8524655 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8524656 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8524657 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8524658 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8524659 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

8524859 we have already submitted written demands to the governors panel and are expecting a favourable response from them
8524860 a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the bread which it has earned
8524861 with respect to the words general welfare i have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers enumerated in the constitution connected with them to take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators
8524862 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
8524863 i cannot find any authority in the constitution for public charity such spending would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the union of these states is founded
8524864 federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character
8524865 i feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan to indulge in benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public funds
8524866 we must always ask is government working to liberate and empower the individual is it creating incentives for people to produce save invest and profit from legitimate risks and honest toil is it encouraging all of us to reach for the stars or does it seek to compel command and coerce people into submission and dependence ask these questions because no matter where you look today you will see that development depends on economic freedom

8524889 ultimately any effective regulation is in a sense a joint responsibility weve increased the number of regulators but we also do rely obviously on the work done within the companies themselves
8524890 we have increased the number of inspectors weve increased the amount we spend on protection but we do also plan as we move forward to change the system to make sure that we have greater responsibility on those who ultimately market the product

8525264 there are a number of teams who could win it and it would be no surprise if they did
8525265 if you cannot enjoy the champions league what can you enjoy
8525266 the draw is always an exciting time you look forward to seeing who you are playing whether it is a new challenge and how far you are travelling

8525371 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
8525372 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos
8525373 salvar la honra e imagen de mapuches buenos de nuestras comunidades
8525374 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
8525375 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8525376 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8525377 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
8525378 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
8525379 there is really nothing you can do it is only going to spread and get worse
8525380 this charter does not benefit the indigenous people because a lot of changes that has been proposed by the interim government totally defy our traditional values which we have lived from the past
8525381 our stand will never change because this document is evil and misleading to the people and we cannot be forced to accept something we dont want
8525382 we have distributors that have turnover in excess of 157 1 million us 100 million and are very large reputed and established alcoholic and non alcoholic distributors in usa many of our distributors are budweiser and miller coors beer houses
8525383 island chill is certified in 24 regulating states of usa and can now sell in all of the 50 states
8525384 the company has immense underground water source for its expansion plans in future
8525385 the planned expansion would require as much as 10 million investment and the company board is planning to invite private investors locally and overseas as well
8525386 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8525387 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8525388 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8525389 the russian side has stressed the need for tbilisi to carry out point four of the medvedev sarkozy plan under which all georgian troops should be returned to their original bases
8525390 medvedev and sarkozy also discussed additional agreements which may in future ensure safety in the areas near the borders of south ossetia and abkhazia
8525391 he reached back when he needed it he was a consistent 94 and 95 miles an hour then reaches back and throws 97 up in the zone and thats hard to catch up to not many people can dial it up to 97
8525392 if there was something wrong with him before there is certainly nothing wrong with him now
8525393 i made a mistake to pence for the second time in a row
8525394 he got me when we played in cincinnati too it was a 2 0 changeup in cincinnati and a hanging curve today he is a good hitter and he did what he is supposed to do with those
8525395 when you are pitching against a guy like roy oswalt you have to be pretty good because he was one of the premier guys in the league his track record is that he is going to put up zeros
8525396 i dont think roy cruises or anything but he really showed me what he has on that at bat
8525397 after the last pitch he gave me a little stare and i kind of got goosebumps because i love competition it was awesome even though i lost
8525398 he has almost no fear and has really good stuff and that combination leads to a lot of success
8525399 i wasnt around for about 21 of those wins of his but tonight he looked like one of the best pitchers in baseball
8525400 we willen graag een met en een zonder uitjes kan dat nog
8525401 volgende week beginnen de colleges ik hoop dat ik daar ook snel mensen leer kennen
8525402 komt goed je zei toch dat de introductie leuk was
8525403 ik ook op maandag gelijk om 9 uur maar we hebben nauwelijks les maar 14 uur per week
8525404 ik dacht toen dat de federale regering de achterblijvers te hulp zou komen
8525405 ik had het mis we gaan die fout niet herhalen
8525406 i worry about all three figgys toe he was hobbling around erick aybar is as tough as they come so when he has to come out of a game you know its serious and with howie its re visiting something that happened earlier in the year so were naturally concerned about that
8525407 its nothing to the extent of what happened in seattle
8525408 but i know its there a little bit maybe just lunging for the bag it kind of grabbed overextended my muscle it stinks that it happened to be honest with you
8525409 hopefully its just a couple days or something like that
8525410 i think it was a classic case of a pitcher getting up in the zone and flattening out his sinker
8525411 he just had trouble getting the ball down in the zone and letting the movement work for him he got behind in counts and couldnt really get to his other pitches his breaking ball and changeup
8525412 its not a fun feeling going out there and putting your team in a hole like i did
8525413 we respect the right of elected officials such as speaker pelosi to address matters of public policy that are before them but the interpretation of catholic faith has rightfully been entrusted to the catholic bishops given this responsibility to teach it is important to make this correction for the record
8525414 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8525415 having a tear in your wedding dress right before you walk down the aisle
8525416 that happens you have to do what you can to pitch around that and try to limit your mistakes as a player you cant worry about things that are out of your control
8525417 i think he kent has gotten pitches to hit hitting in front of manny
8525418 but i think the top of the order consistently hasnt been as productive as were capable of being and as we have been that doesnt mean im placing blame
8525419 we are ever confident that it will get done but we have always said it will go to the wire
8525420 we will keep moving it on and we hope that he will be joining us here at chelsea
8525421 there were two players luiz felipe scolari identified one was deco and one was robinho and we have already seen the impact deco has made on the premier league
8525422 i think the squad is strong and capable of competing in all competitions without robinho but with him it is an added dimension
8525423 robinho continues being a real madrid player and the coach counts on him
8525424 those in charge of the sporting side of things want him to continue and ive always wanted to follow the plans of those who really know about these things
8525425 me going to chelsea im staying as a rossoneri player
8525426 i should help milan to win the trophies were up for this season
8525427 ive always said im happy at milan and as long as my aims remain the same as milans ill stay here until now its always been that way
8525428 my goal is to win milans is too as long as we are like that ill remain at milan
8525429 he wright phillips doesnt want to join either of them and we are now discussing the next move to see what we do
8525430 the operation is over our special forces killed the third militant early on thursday
8525431 the final assault was launched at 2345 1815 gmt on wednesday by the army and the entire family of the house owner including four children were rescued

8525458 expansion of the a league is a critical issue to the continuing evolution and growth of football and this is a very exciting day for ffa everyone involved in the a league gold coast united and north queensland
8525459 the gold coast is a vitally important region for football
8525460 it is one of the fastest growing regions in the country with a population already over half a million and a strong level of participation and interest in the sport
8525461 we know that the people of the gold coast enjoy supporting local teams and i have no doubt skilled park will be one of the best home grounds in the country
8525462 north queensland has met all the commercial criteria we set for them last month including local community and business support which has been terrific
8525463 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time
8525464 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8525465 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8525466 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period
8525467 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8525468 it is quite clear we will see more automotive component redundancies that flow from reduction in the assemblers
8525469 the government needs to intervene to ensure that we have a strong future
8525470 i certainly need to keep working to look after the family
8525471 weve got to have protection and lowering our protection aint doing our industry any good whatsoever
8525472 hes a very good player daniel kerr maybe someone might be prepared to trade out a first round pick
8525473 well keep our picks we wont be trading we want to keep our first pick and as of today theres also 17 and 19 well be really keen to keep our picks
8525474 we have a young list now and this year its important that we draft well
8525475 every year you should draft well you cant pick and choose drafts and you have to ensure you put all of the work into it so you can produce and develop players
8525476 weve got a young list now well have a young list again next year

8525498 when i saw anelka walking up to take his penalty i had a feeling i was going to save it and it wasnt as if the shot was high in the top corner or low down i reached two champions league finals for ajax in 1995 and 1996 and then you think they are normal games to play in but then it dries up
8525499 i dont care that the focus was on john terrys miss rather than my save from anelka
8525500 i am not worried about being a legend like solskjaer you do your bit and thats what counts
8525501 i certainly took in a lot more at moscow than i did in the final in 1999
8525502 gerrard will have an operation tomorrow on a groin problem
8525503 we knew this would happen he had a problem and now he will have an operation and he will be out for 10 or 15 days its not a big problem but he had pain and it was difficult
8525504 it wasnt affected by the period of extra time when he went away with england we knew he had a problem and we knew he had a problem before the first leg
8525505 yesterday he spoke to the doctor about the situation and he said ok ill play with pain and after have the operation he was playing with pain before and he kept going today because he knew he was going to see the surgeon tomorrow its not serious its a minor operation but we needed to do it
8525506 for me the most positive thing is we played a little bit better against a good team who are sharp now
8525507 we scored right at the end that showed the team were working really hard

8525527 todos eles sublinharam a import ncia de os estados unidos restaurarem a sua credibilidade no mundo e a sua reputa o no mundo a sua lideran a moral neste contexto foi sublinhado como seria uma prioridade para uma administra o obama p r a nu tudo o que se passou em rela o a guantanamo s pris es secretas e s torturas
8525528 h muito tempo que ando a avisar que seria exactamente da parte americana que viria a iniciativa j se est a ver isso erigido como uma prioridade pela administra o obama
8525529 da mesma maneira que o partido democrata dos estados unidos considera que essa uma quest o essencial para restaurar a sua autoridade e a sua credibilidade tamb m na europa essencial para restaurar a nossa credibilidade a nossa autoridade e a nossa capacidade de efectivamente promovermos a democracia e os direitos humanos

8525531 the fact that china has its own separatist problems certainly in xinjiang province and in tibet especially makes it a very sensitive topic and chinas always been very anti separatist
8525532 the precedent of giving such support to the georgian separatist regions and potentially offering them independence or even union with russia would be something that would be very sensitive for china indeed
8525533 the area around the ferghana valley is a mismatch of various pockets of ethnicities within the states especially the large uzbek populations within kyrgyzstan and tajikistan
8525534 the fear for these central asian states is the precedent set in perhaps offering independence to abkhazia or south ossetia and support for them could kick start something in this region
8525535 from our perspective there hasnt been any further discussion on this since that was announced as something of interest to gazprom
8525536 it doesnt mean its not possible but all our efforts on denali have been directly with bp and the state of alaska to do the work we have been doing and hopefully we can work toward an open season in the next several years

8525543 the longer term challenge for companies is to move away from testing quality into the product to building quality into the product which requires addressing the entire software development process not just bug fixing at the end
8525544 from experience it is much cheaper to capture the bugs or security vulnerabilities earlier in the software development tools
8525545 using a combination of automated code generation and world class tools development environments and methodologies any mistake can be rectified within the time and cost envelope
8525546 the reason companies are increasingly looking to service providers to assist with this is that they dont have the internal capability to address this issue and believe they need specialists to assist with improving their testing capability initially and to help them improve their overall software development processes and methodology in the long run
8525547 with things like soa it becomes a challenge how to even test something since some parts of the architecture may actually be out of the enterprises control and access from a testing perspective
8525548 for instance web2 0 is a brilliant technology that gives the business user a great user experience however there are limited prescriptive guidance and architecture as to how best to implement it
8525549 i feel vindicated i feel great that i am back
8525550 the prime minister has lost the mandate of the country and the nation
8525551 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8525552 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8525553 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8525554 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8525555 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8525556 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8525557 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8525558 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8525559 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8525560 it looks like a lot of work so i am thinking about it but i havent given an answer yet

8525563 we need to wait a few more years before we can say definitely that things are getting worse but there does seem to be a growing problem in some areas
8525564 we are seeing parts of the outlying regions being affected rather than just urban areas
8525565 urban areas might be dealing with the problem more effectively but in the outlying regions it seems to be getting worse places like newport plymouth st davids stockport
8525566 if you look at liverpool sheffield and bristol the levels are low
8525567 in the outlying areas health services are maybe less available in a city the services are better such as local access to gps
8525568 however we need to bear in mind that some pcts are better at recording the data than others which could affect the results
8525569 the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person whos the ideal beauty of the moment

8525578 well strike their hideouts we wont show any kind of relaxation
8525579 they havent played a game who knows what happens we might go out there on thursday night and it might be 3 0 it might also be 46 43 nobody knows
8525580 as soon as you lose a game thats going to be the reason
8525581 they are looking at an offense thats been retooled for a new quarterback and so on so its gonna make a real interesting start to a football game
8525582 i dont think anybody will be able to sit in the stands and say well anybody can call those plays thats the same thing theyve been doing
8525583 fans arent gonna be bored everything they see will be the first time theyve ever seen it both sides of the ball and on both sidelines
8525584 thinking gets you beat people jump offsides it makes people play slow and that type thing i think its getting to be much less of a problem and its getting to where its more reactionary which is what it needs to be for football things are clicking right now as long as we dont turn the ball over this year i think we have a chance to have a very good season
8525585 i think in jonathan dwyer they probably have a better player than theyve ever had at that position
8525586 i dont know if they ever could have recruited jonathan to play fullback in this offense but hes probably perfect i think youd have to go back to earl campbell at texas to where you had such a great athlete running in such a similar situation
8525587 we definitely do a lot more blocking than in the old offense
8525588 in the new offense were lined up almost on the line outside of the tackles
8525589 its a different view for me and its a different type running too we do a lot of outside running and catch a lot of passes too
8525590 can we carry it from the practice fields to the game field
8525591 but what really incensed me was when i was told i could not change it back to lloyds is pants because they said it was not appropriate
8525592 i asked if it was pants they didnt like and would lloyds is rubbish do but they didnt think so
8525593 so i tried barclays is better and that didnt go down too well either
8525594 the rules seemed to change and they told me it had to be one word so i tried censorship but they didnt like that and then said it had to be no more than six letters long

8525625 my client wishes to advise that she is concentrating on her recovery as this is the paramount consideration at this point in time
8525626 she has expressed some disappointment in the number of inaccuracies contained in much of the media coverage of the incident
8525627 however under legal advice she has not yet released her statement of events
8525628 she does request that the media and others respect her privacy and that of her family during this difficult period
8525629 she would like to convey her gratitude for the many expressions of support she has received and most especially to those health care professionals who have provided her care
8525630 mr anderson has indicated that as a nsw wheat grower and awb a class shareholder he supports reform in light of the new wheat export marketing arrangements
8525631 without a single desk and the introduction of a competitive marketplace growers now need genuine choice from domestic exporters and i believe that it is in growers interests that the awb can be as competitive as possible
8525632 in these circumstances i have come to believe that it is in growers best interest to vote for reform
8525633 it is quite clear we will see more automotive component redundancies that flow from reduction in the assemblers

8525665 we want to open up this convention to make sure that everybody that wants to come can join in the party and join in the effort to take america back
8525666 i am much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
8525667 theres a concern in the campaign about how do you pull this off in a way that makes it about the economic themes they want to hit
8525668 he needs to get from the stadium to the diner and its a hard thing to pull off

8525676 but what we stress to them here from day one is how to carry themselves in a respectful way and the payoff is years later when they become productive adults years after some dumb friday night football game
8525677 we know our work is cut out for us but im not sticking around unless i feel i can still be useful somehow and that isnt going to happen if im not trying to prepare these kids to win games
8525678 the basic idea with geomap is we do research projects and training and education in the area of geographic information science and systems
8525679 it basically involved taking some satellite imagery that was being taken of the state and the midwest in general and sorting it out and processing it and making it usable for people in state agencies who are trying to assess the damage of the flood
8525680 right now everyone is trying to put together a clearer picture of what happened and it is still happening
8525681 the impact of the project on the state on us as citizens of illinois is significant multiple watersheds have been affected and with them the people and animals who live there
8525682 the state as a whole was a little behind in terms of getting this imagery right away
8525683 we hope that the imagery can be used by people who are interested in assessing the damage
8525684 is it in good taste for young girls to wear black the problem is merely one of whether or not black is becoming black is the most unbecoming color in the world by and large it takes the life and vitality from the wearer its the color of death its much easier to wear black when youre young and vital then when you are old and gray i would say that the only reason for not wearing black is that it sometimes depresses other people to the extent to which you are concerned with the feelings of others you might say it was good taste not to go about depressing them

8525693 simply werent satisfied with the map data we had available
8525694 data were never on google maps in the first place
8525695 the rapid spread of infectious disease whether naturally occurring or due to terrorist activities is a critical national concern
8525696 we will be developing models that can predict the extent of future disease outbreaks an essential step for developing pro active monitoring and control strategies
8525697 today we can only collect data after the fact when something such as a pandemic flu outbreak occurs
8525698 that only tells us what already happened by developing epidemiological models we hope to be able to accurately predict what will happen so that health officials have a plan of action before the first case of an infectious disease is even diagnosed
8525699 trying to track how a disease spreads is very difficult because people move constantly
8525700 people easily travel from town to town state to state and country to country we hope to develop models that will include geographic environmental and demographic information on population groups that will help explain the interaction of populations which will be a major part of predicting how a disease will spread

8525754 a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the bread which it has earned
8525755 with respect to the words general welfare i have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers enumerated in the constitution connected with them to take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators
8525756 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
8525757 i cannot find any authority in the constitution for public charity such spending would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the union of these states is founded
8525758 federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character
8525759 i feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan to indulge in benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public funds
8525760 we must always ask is government working to liberate and empower the individual is it creating incentives for people to produce save invest and profit from legitimate risks and honest toil is it encouraging all of us to reach for the stars or does it seek to compel command and coerce people into submission and dependence ask these questions because no matter where you look today you will see that development depends on economic freedom

8525767 when theres not enough money it affects their wellbeing very quickly
8525768 theres a false sense of security thats certainly been evident

8525782 fraudster companies there are certain companies in the market which take the loans to buy there necessary requirements and then just happen to disappear with the money
8525783 nevertheless there is no question that substantial logging and road building have occurred on those lands and that these activities have had a significant impact on the sustainability of timber resources and on other aspects of gitanyow tradition and culture
8525784 parents need to be aware of the circumstances and be listening for information
8525785 a strategy is being put together and we will be ready at the school level to respond my goal at the moment is to be sure of accommodating any request or expectation
8525786 at this stage we wont be providing immunization clinics but through the provincial health officer we will be monitoring any potential cases that we see in schools and providing those immunization opportunities should the need arise
8525787 i believe that parents always want what is best for their kids though they make different decisions around immunizations
8525788 if theres an outbreak and your kids not immunized keep them home dont just continue to spread the virus around ideally this should be a quarantine issue
8525789 they do it for hepatitis and the boosters you know polio and whatnot they do it at school so why not mumps
8525790 the district was very good and active a few months ago about immunization so i was happy about that
8525791 i havent had any concerns addressed to me for chilliwack its been in the paper for quite a few months
8525792 that being the case we would be offering clinics on a routine basis but i think what well be doing particularly in vancouver is looking for cases and if we start to see cases well start taking more proactive measures
8525793 we clarified through legislation when schools can be charged but there seems to be confusion with boards of education from time to time about what they can charge fees for
8525794 the reason we felt comfortable with the fee system still in place was that boards were required to ensure that any child that couldnt pay would be supported by the school district
8525795 the announcements havent affected us the way they affected other school districts because we havent charged fees for many years
8525796 and we have a rider on everything in the district that if there is a child who cant afford to go to an academy then we will pay for it they dont have to prove that their parents have lost a job or anything like that weve had these policies in place for so many years that it is just the way we do business
8525797 for working in walnut when we are handing out pine theyd have to pay the difference
8525798 our district is in full compliance of the law in spirit and letter it wasnt difficult but there was a cost that being said however most of what we had offered before is still available to students
8525799 it is my submission that that has not been proved certainly not to the criminal standard and that a doubt based on reason exists
8525800 jose hernandez theres evidence before this court to conclude has no accent he speaks like a canadian born young man because thats what he is
8525801 the low must be less than or equal to the high
8525802 nous regrettons les blocages qui ne sont pas sans cons quences financi res a ne peut pas perdurer

8525805 with natural resources having already achieved a 10 per cent margin and our other core businesses expected to make strong progress in 2008 we have raised our group margin target for 2010 from 8 to 8 5 per cent
8525806 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8525807 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8525808 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8525809 nobody knows i kind of left it on the table when to have it not even doctors can tell me that
8525810 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8525811 the uncertainty in global financial markets does not reflect demand from customers which has remained consistently robust
8525812 we decided to go into business because we wanted to stay at home and take care of them
8525813 he came in with me and i was experienced and he did well with me
8525814 its really great to have this high tech engine in madison chugging away but we need that kind of energy and largesse to be spread to other parts of the state particularly milwaukee
8525815 eight years ago i would have been very skeptical about getting this kind of money from the department of commerce but i can tell you the department of commerce is truly open for business
8525816 the democratic leadership in the senate they dont get it at the level their leader doyle gets it
8525817 just like our emotions are running i think the fans are too
8525818 hey its a big day weve been waiting for this for eight months nine months theres nothing better especially at home its our stadium they love us there its precious to us almost sacred
8525819 but i try to be very relaxed there are some players that will get really fired up but thats not me
8525820 last year i would goof off with former fellow linebacker bryan kehl throw the ball around wed stay loose im not one to get mad at the world
8525821 theyre probably just as excited as us and want to get going
8525822 just like the crowd we want perfection we want to do the best we can on every play there will be a times where a guy misses an assignment but thats just another opportunity for next time to do it even better
8525823 i love that feeling coming out of the locker room hearing the crowd go whenever the players do the haka and everyone erupts its amazing but its a lot of nerves
8525824 thats the face i saw on both of these men
8525825 he basically said he doesnt want to do this all by himself and if anybody wants to take care of the other two
8525826 a truck came into the parking lot at a high rate of speed with screeching tires and i started to walk over there to tell him to slow down
8525827 mendez kept telling him to get down on the ground two or three times but he wouldnt listen he just kept walking forward aggressively like he wanted to fight
8525828 i didnt hear him identify himself and i didnt see his badge at all
8525829 at the time he just seemed like some guy to me but given the warnings i dont know why the other guy didnt get down on the ground it was obvious that the next thing that was going to happen was that he was going to get shot
8525830 i dont care who you are you call 911 in that situation
8525831 you dont chase someone down the freeway pull a gun on him tell him to get down on the ground and shoot him he was a trained policeman he didnt need to shoot him
8525832 everybody in the neighborhood is so upset its so sad and so wrong
8525833 he had a baby in the backseat who would drive like that with a baby in the car and then to pull out a gun in the parking lot in front of everyone its shocking to see that kind of thing in your neighborhood especially from a police officer
8525834 he basically said he doesnt want to do this all by himself and if anybody wants to take care of the other two
8525835 first sergeant hatley then made the call to take the detainees to a canal and kill them
8525836 so the patrol went to the canal and first sergeant sgt first class mayo and i took the detainees out of the back of the bradley fighting vehicle lined them up and shot them
8525837 then we pushed the bodies into the canal and left
8525838 committed an act that was criminal even on the battlefield a federal prosecutor told a riverside jury today
8525839 some people might say we need more services a city might be wealthy enough to buy and buy and buy but there is a leveling point when no matter how much more service you purchase you start to see diminishing returns

8525850 this will have a substantial impact on the healthcare system decreasing the pressure as more cancers are prevented
8525851 we have the knowledge today to reduce the cancer burden worldwide in australia cancer survival has increased significantly over the past two decades with 58 per cent of men and 64 per cent of females surviving beyond 5 years of their cancer diagnoses
8525852 if we compare this to the period from 1982 1986 only 41 per cent of men and 53 per cent of women were surviving five years after their cancer diagnoses
8525853 seventy per cent of worldwide cancer deaths have occurred in low and middle income countries which belies the assumption often made that cancer is not a significant problem beyond affluent nations
8525854 ones decision to avoid smoking be sunsmart reduce alcohol intake eat a nutritionally balanced diet exercise regularly and participate in vaccination programs can significantly impact the cancer burden
8525855 the dramatic clinical results from this study of gleevec in the adjuvant gist setting are especially encouraging when we consider the incremental benefit we typically see with other adjuvant therapies for solid tumors

8525865 a wise and frugal government which shall restrain men from injuring one another which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement and shall not take from the mouth of labour the bread which it has earned
8525866 with respect to the words general welfare i have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers enumerated in the constitution connected with them to take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators
8525867 i cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the constitution which granted a right to congress of expending on objects of benevolence the money of their constituents
8525868 i cannot find any authority in the constitution for public charity such spending would be contrary to the letter and the spirit of the constitution and subversive to the whole theory upon which the union of these states is founded
8525869 federal aid in such cases encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character
8525870 i feel obliged to withhold my approval of the plan to indulge in benevolent and charitable sentiment through the appropriation of public funds
8525871 we must always ask is government working to liberate and empower the individual is it creating incentives for people to produce save invest and profit from legitimate risks and honest toil is it encouraging all of us to reach for the stars or does it seek to compel command and coerce people into submission and dependence ask these questions because no matter where you look today you will see that development depends on economic freedom
8525872 house full of kids i needed to corral for a few days especially in the summer
8525873 it comes from my personality i am often described as over active i like to see how much i can fit in a day but my kids were young then i liked to go go go but we needed some structure
8525874 what ive learned over the years is that you can miss things that are right in your own backyard and even with the price of gas doing a lot of these things is cheaper than going off for an entire weekend and booking a hotel
8525875 its harvest time so there are a lot of wonderful activities going on at the farms around the state
8525876 no need to stow the beach gear yet i would use this time to check out someplace youve never been
8525877 it is a terrific museum that doesnt get its due and a wonderful place to take the kids
8525878 its a great spot a lot of fairfield county residents have missed because of their own beaches
8525879 the kids are in school so i go catch up on my reading when no one is around
8525880 we still go i pack a lunch because sometimes the concessions are closed but i hate the idea of quitting summer so soon
8525881 its hard though to head back south after youve seen all that green
8525882 i think that we have a national security interest in the area middle east
8525883 does it surprise us that someone like hugo chavez is fanning anti americanism in latin america if all they are getting from us is rhetoric and they are getting substantial assistance from venezuela
8525884 is by sitting down and listening to people understanding their different points of view
8525885 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8525886 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8525887 so hes got more degrees than a thermometer so he speaks seven languages so hes read every book so what the important thing is hes had no experience he didnt start at the bottom and work up thats the only way you can learn
8525888 as my father used to say a reporter has to do a lot of sweating before he earns the right to perspire

8525895 yesterday the third batch of damages was paid to those who have suffered damage from the bombings that occurred in al kahtaniya 35km south of sinjar district
8525896 i feel responsible to show my colleagues a good time this is my district im the hostess of the week
8525897 so i had to give them a comfortable place to be
8525898 god told me to stand here and i am open for that guidance
8525899 i am hoping to get as many tickets as i can for members of the agape international spiritual choir
8525900 fall is the best time to fix all the mistakes ive made
8525901 sometimes its a misunderstanding between me and a plant now weve gone through one season together and ive learned what doesnt work or what needs to be adjusted
8525902 im not a fan of gardening when its 90 degrees
8525903 in the fall theres not so much stress for you or for plants
8525904 these days gardeners are looking for something besides the traditional mums and gourds and kale
8525905 and there are lots of choices for yellows and oranges dark maroons and for spicing the garden up with fall reds
8525906 and mixed with super bells you have a beautiful combo
8525907 a garden designer can help you look at your landscape and understand what you want it to do and get it organized
8525908 trees do things in a landscape that little plants just dont accomplish
8525909 the only thing we have to fear is fear itself
8525910 a great speech resonates with problems that people are feeling and the aspirations they have with respect to those problems
8525911 if jfk had gotten up there and mumbled through his inaugural address we probably wouldnt remember it
8525912 if jfk had gotten up there and mumbled through his inaugural address we probably wouldnt remember it
8525913 it was the secret of his 48 campaign when he was on the back of the train engaging with the audience
8525914 obama is particularly skilled at this and so was fdr but it wasnt reagans style
8525915 when the audience is cheering he pauses and then continues to speak and they cheer louder so it builds to a kind of crescendo
8525916 sometimes presidents or politicians will try to force a phrase that ends up being a clunker because its being forced
8525917 i have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted every hill and mountain shall be made low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together
8525918 hey theres still a war going on the economy is sagging and the biggest drain is the war
8525919 and we will do this nonviolently in the spirit of martin luther king and nelson mandela
8525920 anyone who is inspired by nature is using biomimicry in a sense
8525921 the exchange of molecules and atoms has a direct effect on our biochemistry and that has a direct effect on our physical state
8525922 people have done this innately without putting words to it
8525923 biomimicry and biophilia speak to a part of us that wants to be with the gentle movement of the world
8525924 the intention is to use the healing power of nature
8525925 we may not be aware thats what were doing but thats why we feel better in the space
8525926 its a restful peaceful place because it reflects the outdoors
8525927 theres a serenity to following the heart of a place and where you are in the land
8525928 it is far more involved than just bringing nature or natural elements inside
8525929 it is clear to me that both biophilia and biomimicry were addressing the human need to not only experience nature but to learn from nature as a model for design
8525930 something we have done for thousands of years but lost our ability to do during the last few generations
8525931 environments that integrate biophilic attributes can provide the respite needed to overcome stress mental fatigue even illness
8525932 that doesnt necessarily mean leaves and flowers but small references that tickle nostalgia
8525933 this initiative is a cornerstone in developing a state of the art infrastructure to attain our goal of developing kaec as a true smart city the network will support the latest emerging technologies of convergence and ensure access to innovative services for the public and various industries and enterprises within kaec
8525934 i want you to listen to me im going to say this again i did not have any doubts about this nominee mr obama i never told anybody he was unfit not a single time never these allegations are false and i need to go back to work for the obama people thank you
8525935 im sure if it was for some kind of independent brand that wasnt as iconic as calvin klein i dont think i would have done it because thats too much of a risk
8525936 but when its calvin klein and its fashion photographer steve meisel shooting you and you get to be a part of this amazing iconic brand and their legacy you just kind of go for it
8525937 rugged military grade design and extra strength cables which make s your hardware hardcore
8525938 we know its going to head into the gulf after that were not sure
8525939 for that reason everyone in the gulf needs to be monitoring the storm
8525940 a bad storm churning in the gulf could be a nightmare scenario
8525941 we might see oil prices spike us 5 to us 8 if it really rips into platforms
8525942 combined with the deep warm waters rapid intensification could occur in a couple of days
8525943 its all about concern normal people have been quite noble but they are growing resentful they are angry at having to worry about strangers and their increased risk for diabetes and heart disease
8525944 obesity likely results from a genetically predetermined body mass set point that exerts control of body weight through alterations in basal metabolic rate
8525945 just when we think we are making progress when we are at a stage where young women and pre teens are realizing the necessity of an ultra lean body some irresponsible doctor will come up with a stupid theory like that
8525946 i am so sick of worrying about people i dont know besides fat people sweat and steal things

8525952 we get better access because they know that generally were going to give them favourable coverage
8525953 frankly were not that interested in breaking big stories were all thrilled to be here
8525954 were the biggest blog in the state but we didnt get state credentials
8525955 im looking for the track so i can get a seat because i like to sit on the outside
8525956 when i travel with my wife its really a pain getting two seats together
8525957 the ticket counter said it was going to be 20 minutes late
8525958 in europe you can hop the train so much easier and its cheaper i dont know why we cant do that here if they had more trains maybe i would ride more
8525959 they have a fair number of passenger cars that are out of service that could be put back into service with modest amounts of expenditure but their budget doesnt permit that
8525960 for me it costs the same to fly to drive or to take the train so you just have to pick your poison
8525961 i want to stay out of the airports so its easier to do this
8525962 i can assure you we take all precautions all rules of engagement are followed we have tremendous confidence and faith in our leadership here in afghanistan
8525963 the enemy which is trying to do things to make a propaganda campaign out of such incidents so nobody benefits
8525964 definitely we ourselves and the international community will exercise maximum caution to prevent such incidents which go against all of our wishes and all of the ideals which we are here fighting for
8525965 prevent the repetition of such incidents which are so unfortunate
8525966 having these eyes in the sky that allow us to locate the taliban to see in some instances where they are making these ieds improvised explosive devices that are having such a horrific effect on the troops and the civilian population
8525967 there is no question that this has been a tough season very difficult sledding for our forces as well as our allies
8525968 it is also our intention that we should not be a burden on our canadian friends and allies or the rest of the international community forever
8525969 everything i learned in eight years as president has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8525970 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8525971 barack obama knows that america cannot be strong abroad unless we are strong at home people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8525972 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8525973 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8525974 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years
8525975 if you like me still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8525976 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8525977 just the thought that he cared enough to run to risk his life that means a lot
8525978 its like im living my dream last night i was sitting in there with some lady i dont even know and we were both just crying
8525979 that they should see this that they are in the presence of history and that now they know that there is nothing in the world that they cannot achieve
8525980 its a piece of history and its going to be wild
8525981 the republicans will nominate a good man who served our country heroically and suffered terribly in vietnam he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8525982 our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8525983 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8525984 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to drawdown our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8525985 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8525986 it looks like they were going to stage a robbery
8525987 robert borks america is a land in which blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters

8526000 this is the reality we are facing our concern is that consumers buying power is decreasing
8526001 if this situation continues long term it would affect sony
8526002 sony would like to address the needs of this drastically expanding market to establish a leading position
8526003 a total ceasefire is unacceptable because of the fact that we have a law to enforce
8526004 i think there will be tactical adjustments it will depend upon the commander operating in one area
8526005 but it also depends on how the fugitives will use ramadan to shield their actions i mean what they have done are un islamic how do you expect them to conform to islamic norms when they have slaughtered people
8526006 if the evidence shows it then the evidence will point out too that they have not been sincere in the peace process all along
8526007 i mean the question of proving sincerity and good faith now lies squarely on the shoulders of the milf i mean coddling criminals is not a sign of bona fide sincerity in anyones book
8526008 il ny a aucun doute que la progression des prix est li e louragan gustav

8526020 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8526021 john mccain is my friend i mean it weve known each other for three decades weve travelled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism john demonstrated still amazes me
8526022 despite being complicit in the bush administrations catastrophic foreign policy john mccain says barack isnt ready to protect our national security
8526023 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to drawdown our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8526024 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8526025 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory

8526031 managers at bristol had succeeded in reversing the decline we recorded at the last inspection in 2005
8526032 however in spite of these efforts the effects of continued population pressure meant that bristol was not yet performing well enough in three crucial areas safety respect and activity
8526033 bristol is a busy local prison and works hard to provide a safe decent environment
8526034 i am pleased that the chief inspector has acknowledged the hard work by managers and staff in raising the standards since the last inspection

8526044 if somebody doesnt go to the final four during their four years at duke then thats too darn bad
8526045 what we didnt go to the final four we didnt win the national championship theyre very spoiled
8526046 it ruins it a little bit really a lot because of that sometimes when you win youre just relieved im not saying that that happens all the time but it happens
8526047 at the end of that spain game when most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated i was euphoric it was the way it should be and thats the way its going to be for me for the rest of my career at duke
8526048 theres no way i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach
8526049 im a better coach to them and a better person as a result we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason

8526056 the exposure the team had and all the people all over the country who saw what he was able to do with the best players in the country those are all positives for the program
8526057 now i think he has a chip in the game that no one else has
8526058 i believe it is going to exponentially increase his prowess on the recruiting trail
8526059 what happened on sunday was a big deal and its going to continue to be seen that way around the country
8526060 if he can take those nba guys and make them great im sure recruits will think hey he could do that for me

8526069 the world cup qualifying match between georgia and the republic of ireland will not take place at the wildparkstadion on september 6th
8526070 this is the result of discussions between karlsruhe sc and the georgian football federation who would gladly have played the match here we would gladly have accommodated them but due to the short notice and organisational issues we unfortunately have asked the gff to look for another venue
8526071 the reason we wanted to help was because of our player iashvili
8526072 we wanted to make this possible for him but ultimately we had to decide against agreeing to the match

8526087 would energize what seems to be rather lethargic and unenthusiastic republicans
8526088 when the u s invaded iraq it didnt do so to improve irans power position in the region but that was the result
8526089 that wasnt the purpose of the russian invasion of georgia either but it too may be the result
8526090 the reason is on grounds of principle if iran is going to start supporting the secession of territories that are unhappy with the central government then iran itself has some similar issues with ethnic dissatisfaction
8526091 dont view russia as a reliable partner they understand that russia may support iran on the nuclear file depending on its own security or policy interests but russia has also been quite clever in using iran as a bargaining chip in terms of its relationship with the united states
8526092 the iranians are being very clever here theyre not likely to rush to russias defense unless russia comes to them and ask for their help and then they can ask for something in return
8526093 oil and gas companies now must factor in a new level of uncertainty
8526094 georgia is now unstable and that increases the risk of transporting hydrocarbons across it

8526107 incredible what a game no matter who wins this game they deserve it and you should tip your cap to both teams whether you are a mets fan or a phillies fan you should embrace this game that was played tonight
8526108 this was an instant classic with improbable heroes like coste and eric bruntlett in particular extraordinary gamesmanship including newest third baseman carlos ruiz and a bullpen that once again refused to break
8526109 despite the result this was without a doubt the most entertaining baseball game of the season and one of the best games i have seen in years
8526110 no way were winning this game here i just have to hope for a single or walk
8526111 anything is possible when you play in this great plains
8526112 if i say it with confidence it must be true
8526113 he brings calm and confidence to the side and overall we had a good balance in the side
8526114 cesc could have stayed on he always wants to play but he was probably more disappointed that they did not have a go at us
8526115 i have always said we have to be patient with him
8526116 i felt he can be decisive in any game against anybody if we can get him in
8526117 he has improved his first touch and his link up play which was vital for his progression

8526125 ultimately it came down to the fact that i still enjoy playing and competing
8526126 im comfortable with my conditioning and my overall health im ready for the start of camp and am looking forward to the upcoming season
8526127 if somebody doesnt go to the final four during their four years at duke then thats too darn bad
8526128 what we didnt go to the final four we didnt win the national championship theyre very spoiled
8526129 it ruins it a little bit really a lot because of that sometimes when you win youre just relieved im not saying that that happens all the time but it happens
8526130 at the end of that spain game when most people would say werent you relieved no i wasnt i was exhilarated i was euphoric it was the way it should be and thats the way its going to be for me for the rest of my career at duke
8526131 theres no way i shouldnt have done this for duke for me for our country for the kids i coach
8526132 im a better coach to them and a better person as a result we didnt go to the ncaa final four during the last two years because we had two young teams and we got beat all of a sudden theres a reason
8526133 chris looks good back there wide receiver was not his position
8526134 he covers our guys comes up makes tackles at the line of scrimmage he runs 4 3 seconds in the 40 yard dash hes a good looking athlete back there
8526135 we told him he could play what he wanted to
8526136 we were going to give him a chance and that helped us get him
8526137 my shorts folded my shirt folded and my hat on top of it
8526138 i like to put the ball exactly where i want it
8526139 riley just takes everything he does and does it to the 10th degree
8526140 because he really likes mental perfection thats one reason why he was so successful so quickly
8526141 there are a lot of smart quarterbacks out there that dont quite have the ability and there are a lot of kids with great ability but they cant manage the game
8526142 we have a long line of athletes in the family and they all have great arms
8526143 you should be consuming bullys comics content on the regular
8526144 why isnt a little stuffed bull running the comics industry
8526145 hes done a great job improving his game and becoming a better thrower coach skip holtz said
8526146 hes become a great leader become vocal he knows his role has taken it and run with it
8526147 ive worked extra hard ive watched more film my arms gotten stronger
8526148 secondly i told him to play within himself within the system he doesnt have to win the game by himself
8526149 the last couple of years its been shouldve couldve wouldve
8526150 i want to lead this team and at the end of the year i want my teammates to tell me i had a great year and played hard
8526151 when used together cobit and itil provide a top to bottom approach to it governance and more specifically service management cobit guides managements priorities and objectives with a holistic approach to a full range of it activities and itil supports this with best practices for service management
8526152 when combined the power of both approaches is amplified with a greater likelihood of cost savings effective control and management support
8526153 i will never forget the look on the faces of the syracuse players and the fans in the carrier dome
8526154 thats one good thing about playing on thursday night especially this thursday night the first one everybody that doesnt want to watch politics can watch football
8526155 it was a great win for us and the program it got us some national standing because everybody was saying whos n c state we were total underdogs but we ended up winning
8526156 its hard not to think hey im a rock star man
8526157 it was years we needed a home and away and it worked out for south carolina too coming out of the box you kind of remember those opening thursday night games throughout the year
8526158 its different when youre training during the summer and youre preparing for a high profile team like that
8526159 you work a little bit harder you push a little bit more so you can prepare yourself for that team
8526160 i think it really makes duke formidable the perception that he is the ultimate coach in college basketball and what an honor it would be just to have him come into your home much less have your kid play for him
8526161 he krzyzewski never viewed it as a negative in any way
8526162 the exposure the team had and all the people all over the country who saw what he was able to do with the best players in the country those are all positives for the program
8526163 now i think he has a chip in the game that no one else has
8526164 i believe it is going to exponentially increase his prowess on the recruiting trail
8526165 what happened on sunday was a big deal and its going to continue to be seen that way around the country
8526166 if he can take those nba guys and make them great im sure recruits will think hey he could do that for me
8526167 you know what for what he did for basketball in our country he deserves a recruiting boost for what he did
8526168 maybe she lifted her arm up but i didnt see it i was so tired and it doesnt mean its bad sportsmanship it was not my intention
8526169 also the receiver should always follow the server when im ready to serve she should be ready to receive those are the rules
8526170 its going to be good in two days im sure
8526171 its like this tournament it supports me in some kind of way
8526172 were going to wait to see what im going to do i might have to give him an extra day
8526173 this is my third year here i feel like a panther
8526174 i feel like part of the family i love the people here my wife and i moved here
8526175 just knowledge and i think the thing i need to keep reminding myself is with knowledge comes simplicity
8526176 thats something that vinny really hammered in and jakes been hammering into me this year so far
8526177 you want to get good film because you want to stay here
8526178 but obviously the business side of the nfl is not like that
8526179 the fourth preseason game i played awful because i put so much pressure on myself to do well
8526180 i played terrible in 1999 and the next year it was the same situation and my attitude was
8526181 i dont put all this pressure on myself saying oh ive done all of this and what happens if
8526182 i just want to go out there and play the game jake always says were grown men playing a game we love
8526183 its a great opportunity so just go out and flick it around
8526184 it is almost impossible now more than two years later to recall the sheer emotion associated with the hurricanes run to the stanley cup how every moment seemed drenched in significance
8526185 we are going to face great competition in the tri eight from teams like apex panther creek and fuquay varina and we wanted to challenge ourselves to help us prepare
8526186 he has played well but the defense has shut down things so well that we may have given up only five shots or so in four games
8526187 elis performance was the result of nine shots taken in about 40 minutes of playing time limiting his playing time to less than half the game because the opponent was under prepared would have been unfair to a young man who lives to play this game
8526188 theres mixed feelings but its probably time for me to go its probably time for some new thinking and new energy at the leadership level
8526189 today is the last day we will operate as we always have
8526190 beginning tomorrow with the transition of leadership we will become a new more dynamic agency that will continue to nurture and value the relationships we have with our conservation partners and begin to develop new programs that will promote and embrace our mission
8526191 to be as simple as possible i just want to play football
8526192 thats what it comes down to i know whats on the table i know whats on the line i put a lot of work in this and i want to play
8526193 just wasnt a time frame on that my knee still looks pretty good the decision was left up to me to play if you give a football player a decision to play you know im going to play
8526194 how do you tell a warrior to sit down thats what he is a warrior hes trained for this its hard to tell a guy to sit down
8526195 regrettably we are not surprised that mr boras would attempt to raise a meritless legal claim in an effort to compel us to renegotiate pedros contract to one more of his liking
8526196 was done without notice to or consultation with the players association despite a firm deadline having been established through collective bargaining
8526197 it rained every day but i got the job done now i feel very confident in trying to win this event
8526198 killings and torture committed by military security forces protecting and paid for by emoi
8526199 sufficient evidence at this stage for their allegations of serious abuse
8526200 until now i had no idea about that if its true ive just learnt about it from you
8526201 just go ahead and sue the one who will be sued is exxon right
8526202 thats the sign of a good team one that can win in different ways
8526203 weve been able to win the last couple of weeks by sitting back and swinging the bat today we werent swinging the bats very well so we were able to play a little bit different game and it ended up working out for us
8526204 youve got to make sure to take same approach every pitch every at bat every game and not let the mental errors and mental mistakes get to you
8526205 that says a lot for this team how good we feel were going and how good we can be and how were not going to let up until the season is over
8526206 one ball left the infield and they got two runs so what can you do
8526207 and you dont know the extent of it so it scares you when the ambulance comes we know hes in good hands
8526208 everyone that we play for some reason always has a countdown clock to when theyll play the university of miami
8526209 everyone its part of being at miami you have a target on you but you know what these guys understand on this football team that we went through a lot last year we understand what losing is and we understand not to take opponents lightly
8526210 pretty soon well wonder how we got along without it and it wont even be noticed
8526211 the commissioner has come around and hes embraced it because the technology is undeniable im sure there was a time when all of us watched baseball on black and white tvs now i bet you everybody in the room has a high def tv
8526212 the commissioner has been very clear were not going any farther than weve gone
8526213 i have been preparing for it all my life a chance to race in nascar on a national level
8526214 this is a pretty cool deal marc has worked hard and raced his way up to this level im glad i have the opportunity to help him develop and succeed
8526215 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8526216 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8526217 theres nothing like a good dove hunt to tell you hunting season has finally arrived
8526218 the primary reason we started the program is most biologists and managers thought we did not have an adequate database to make informed harvest management decisions
8526219 we did call counts in may of each year and they helped us track the population over a really long time
8526220 we will continue to do the annual call counts but we are merging into this area of collecting better data which includes the banding study
8526221 north carolina hears more doves on our 20 established call count routes than any other state
8526222 we hear more than 30 doves per route and thats why our quota is so high we hear lots of doves in our rural routes but some of our suburban habitat is very good one of our best banding locations is at our raleigh office on varsity drive
8526223 klaar is om president van de verenigde staten te worden
8526224 alles wat ik in acht jaar presidentschap en daarna heb geleerd in de vs en elders ter wereld overtuigt mij ervan dat barack obama de man is voor deze job
8526225 hillary heeft ons gezegd dat ze alles zal doen wat ze kan om te bereiken dat barack obama wordt verkozen met mij erbij zijn dat er twee
8526226 en met jullie erbij zijn dat er 18 miljoen net als hillary wil ik dat jullie die haar hebben gesteund in november voor barack obama kiezen
8526227 we dont need to be playing these games obviously you see in the league that guys are getting hurt you dont need to play obviously with us having a long season last year going to the super bowl playing more games in the preseason and having a risk of injuries is not smart
8526228 since ive been playing i dont think half of us have played that last preseason game
8526229 what you would like to do is have a chance to play a lot of young guys and let them play and put them in situations and let them fend for themselves
8526230 but obviously when the game is over you want them all standing tall and ready to go the next week too
8526231 theyre just coming in to finish off their preseason and we are going out to do the same
8526232 we are going out to win that is the only difference
8526233 my crew has seen a lot of doves in the fields theyll be in good shape by monday opening day were mowing and putting disc strips in
8526234 at falls brickhouse olive grove and penny bend it doesnt look bad
8526235 knapp of reeds is a pretty good one jordan had a lot of crop failures but indian creek 751 and sexton road would be my top three

8526242 it would indeed be very nice if we could convert any one cell type into a different one
8526243 a very elegant and important contribution to the reprogramming field
8526244 if the police want to arrest them come here and do so or if they want our leaders to give themselves up that is fine but the government has to resign first
8526245 this is not a condition that kills you acutely it is a condition that erodes your health over time
8526246 have been sleep deprived for perhaps very long periods of time they are struggling to sleep if this is happening night after night week after week on top of all our other schedules this is a dangerous recipe
8526247 when you stop breathing in your sleep you dont know it it doesnt typically wake you up
8526248 our findings along with those from the wisconsin cohort remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
8526249 it is likely that our findings may underestimate the mortality risk of sdb in other ethnic groups or the lowest socio economic strata where there is poor awareness and access to health care

8526478 you yourselves know that it is unlawful for a jew to associate with or to visit a gentile but god has shown me that i should not call anyone profane or unclean so when i was sent for i came without objection now may i ask why you sent for me

8526542 excuse me but i dont believe jimmy choo designs shoes for men could i have a little more back story pretty please
8526543 there is this saying that goes every woman should own a chanel coat chanel coat not twelve otherwise she wouldnt appreciate it theres nothing wrong with appreciating the finer things as long as you are truly appreciating them and not using them to feel superior in some way

8526558 is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8526559 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8526560 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8526561 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8526562 i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8526563 in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8526564 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8526565 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years and back to unity and hope if like me you believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making barack obama the next president of the united states
8526566 he loves our country every bit as much as we all do
8526567 and as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on several issues
8526568 still embraces the extreme philosophy which has defined his party for more than 25 years

8526576 its really why we bought the place and we think the emphasis for us on the stroll will be the yard

8526578 her granddaughter who was once their neighbor told me that every summer when it started to get hot in woodland she caught a boat in san francisco and went to hawaii when we moved here there was still a little house for the servants and a little bell in the bedroom we rang it but no servants came
8526579 he was somebodys chauffeur he was somebodys dog i dont know
8526580 barack obama is my candidate and he must be our president
8526581 we dont need four more years of the last eight years
8526582 we have to get going by electing barack obama as the next president
8526583 we are working harder than ever but still many of us are falling farther and farther behind
8526584 but we know our future is still golden we know of a path to the promised land and barack obama will lead us there he understands as john f kennedy said that a rising tide lifts all boats together we will rise or together we will fall

8526590 one of the greenest most environmentally friendly governors california has ever seen
8526591 i shined a flashlight in his window and could see that he was naked and confused
8526592 i tried to tell him to turn on the light but he couldnt get oriented
8526593 he was standing in his bathroom screaming that he was stuck in the attic
8526594 were all trying to be compassionate but we all have kids and are concerned for our safety
8526595 i have spoken with the neighbors and they have expressed concern for his health and welfare theyre worried about the poor guy
8526596 the situation is now sad we expect the authorities to act so that it does not become tragic
8526597 i think that because there were so many and because people are afraid of guns hes being painted as someone who was amassing this arsenal when thats not what it was at all i think whats been missing even in cheri raes article is the empathy for a neighbor who is having a hard time because of his infirmities
8526598 it appears that the motivation behind it was to allay the fears of the neighbors
8526599 as of now they only have two people to take those calls and do everything else
8526600 those are the only stones i want in the future
8526601 lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8526602 john mccain is my friend weve traveled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by john still amazes me
8526603 but i profoundly i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrak to veterans
8526604 with russia challenging the very freedom of a new democratic country of georgia barack and i will end that neglect
8526605 we will hold russia accountable for its actions and we will help georgia rebuild
8526606 after seven years of denial even the bush administration recognizes that we should talk to iran because thats the best way to ensure our security
8526607 again and again john mccain has been wrong and barack obama is right
8526608 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says we cant have no timelines to draw down our troops in iraq or should we listen to barack obama who says shift the responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8526609 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8526610 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8526611 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8526612 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8526613 youre better looking than the last frank a few crashes will change that
8526614 emin has turned her life into a public spectacle like no other artist before her
8526615 by the end of this show i felt as if someone had been shouting at me down the phone for a couple of hours a kind of emotional earache
8526616 what distresses me far more than emins taste for the obscene is her amazing unshakable faith in her own importance
8526617 a three month period would be a reasonable extent of time for us to play that role to bring together the peace process
8526618 we are concerned about the continuing violence and this is the first segment of our address so that violence should stop
8526619 in order to give space for both sides to resolve
8526620 sins committed by politicians including ministers we know why they doing it they know we know but thats not stopping them not even election results which showed multi racial lines do work
8526621 given the size of the settlement it plainly falls within the range of settlements that your honour would find fair and reasonable

8526623 when the true state of the company was revealed to the market its share price collapsed and 2 billion came off its market capitalisation

8526625 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8526626 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8526627 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8526628 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8526629 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8526630 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8526631 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8526632 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8526633 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8526644 left to me i may even suggest that states should be scrapped and local governments left because i was two times local government chairman and i experienced full autonomy and when the governors brought the issue of joint account
8526645 the local government is the closest tier of government to the people whose impact is most felt by the constituents but because the councils are currently under the stranglehold of the states not much positive effect is being felt by the electorate the finances meant for the local councils are hijacked by the state governments hence the high rate of poverty at the grassroots

8526647 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8526648 these rocks could not have got there until icebergs started to form and could transport them indicating that large amounts of ice on greenland only began to form about three million years ago
8526649 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet

8526655 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8526656 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8526657 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer

8526706 i was trying to take more control of my career
8526707 you get some nice projects over the transom but its ultimately at somebodys whim
8526708 i dont think people outside the movie industry pay much attention to who produces the liability is still much more on the acting side
8526709 every time you get a chance to make a major movie a lot of people are taking a big gamble on you
8526710 it was 2003 and no one had made a post 9 11 movie yet
8526711 and i was naturally trepidatious about turning news events into art or entertainment or whatever label you want to put on it
8526712 but philosophically what i was trying to do was take on the subject of suicide bombers from a fresh angle and look at moral dilemmas not simply filtered through a black or white lens
8526713 its like having drawn the blueprints for a building that you cant get built
8526714 i believe in writing and rewriting even while shooting i dont want to be one of those directors so married to the script that you miss the opportunity to do something better
8526715 when you come from what i come from my friend its a drug id get up at 4 a m to start training
8526716 you cant play with this subject you have a responsibility you have to be honest my character is not the bad guy hes religious and his faith is being exploited
8526717 terrorism is an abomination against humanity and people do commit terrible acts in the name of islam but i dont believe for a moment that thats the true face of islam what the film tries to show is that a man of islamic faith can make the right choice
8526718 i was dropping off my r sum at his office in new york when i bumped into him in the stairwell he offered me a job on the spot as his assistant and story editor and i helped him sell his art collection which was magnificent my parents had given me a ticket for europe and he said well brandeis boy you must make a choice so i dropped the europe plan and started work the next monday
8526719 were not going to turn our backs on our friends because they have become successful
8526720 so for example we wouldnt not play feist because shes had humongous hits because her music is a perfect fit for our show that having been said theres a lot of stuff on our show that otherwise doesnt really get played on the radio at all
8526721 we never want it to seem like we know so much about this great music and here it is to be know y is not our goal we want to share music with people just like a friend who always seems to know everything about music but doesnt do it in a snobby way
8526722 which as ive come to understand is a little unusual
8526723 since bono cant run for u s president obama is the next best thing a group for those of us who see in obama a progressive christian who embodies the ideas and sentiments we find so compelling in u2s music

8526751 i dont think we need some eight year old kid re singing im n luv wit a stripper
8526752 classic t pain but different t pain at the same time
8526753 the control is awesome because a lot of dudes dont get control
8526754 so to have the production and the writing and the singing coming from the same heart and same mind the songs just come out way better
8526755 ive been to a lot of strip clubs and ive heard a lot of life stories
8526756 i dont sit and talk to strippers hoping im going to get a song out of it
8526757 but for me im a good listener so i just apply the things ive heard or been through real life situations that way people can relate to your songs way more than if im just making something up trying to be clever
8526758 theres a different situation every 30 minutes in someones life why not write about that instead
8526759 at first all these people were laughing at me for using it
8526760 but now that theyre all using it it sounds like theyre singing a t pain song
8526761 my dad always told me that if you want to make god laugh just try telling him your plans
8526762 the officer informed me that i had to wait until the song was over
8526763 next thing i know he was pinning my arm behind my back
8526764 ive never seen anyone handled like that unless theyve thrown a punch
8526765 standing on his seat cursing using inappropriate language and acting in a disrespectful manner while reeking of alcohol
8526766 you wonder where we would be without moose this year
8526767 hes been so consistent this year he has 16 wins and there have been games hes pitched where he deserved to win as well hes been a definite constant in our rotation and its great to have him out there today
8526768 hes been very productive in the no 6 hole hes had a lot of big hits for us
8526769 its not the time that you want it to happen but joses been very very good for us hes had a very good year but he had trouble executing his pitches they made him pay
8526770 obviously the game got away from us in the eighth inning until that point it was close and we had a chance
8526771 we should win that game it was bad its the first time its happened to me
8526772 i know they tried hard to catch it i didnt make the pitches i had to make to get that guy out i rushed a little bit i dont know why i was good in the bullpen
8526773 he just got a hold of it i wish it wouldve been on the corner instead of where it was
8526774 that names such as mitt romney and joe lieberman have been put out their to throw the press of the scent of mccains decision
8526775 other republicans said they suspected that whatever mccains personal views his aides could be pushing lieberman with reporters as part of a disinformation campaign to stir interest in the selection and to make it appear as if mccain a longtime opponent of abortion was open to all possibilities and was therefore more of an independent candidate
8526776 not something crazy just to spend my time there in the offseason i dont know too much about it my friend is helping me out thats one of my favorite things off of the field in the offseason listening to music listening to reggaeton ive got a couple of songs too
8526777 before it gets close to spring training im going to go home thats where i work out back in the dominican its kind of too cold here ive got to get ready for spring training
8526778 hes done it before for us im very confident that hes going to bounce back
8526779 i cant even describe in words how disappointing it is
8526780 i didnt do my job i wanted to go deep in the game and i couldnt even get out of the fifth inning i didnt give us a chance to win
8526781 they tie the game up and to go out and give up two runs is not good

8526786 together in one voice right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8526787 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8526788 republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8526789 the choice in this election is clear these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change

8526792 budget and schedule of implementation of the project is quite clear
8526793 our detailed analysis also indicated that the use of statins had major effects on the association between ldl cholesterol and all site cancer obscuring the true nature of the association
8526794 several prospective analyses including the us national health and nutrition examination survey 2 have demonstrated an inverse relation between serum total cholesterol and cancer incidence and mortality in the general population
8526795 in this review we found no high quality clinical evidence to support current treatment goals for ldl cholesterol
8526796 the insanity must stop americans have been conned big pharma and the american heart association should be held responsible for past crimes and future intended crimes against the health of our citizens under the false pretense of improved cardiovascular health
8526797 ive fought many elections and leadership races over the past couple of years and im quite happy to govern
8526798 obviously governments always prefer a majority but i think we can make a minority work most of the time so im happy to keep on governing as long as were getting some things done
8526799 this parliament is increasingly reaching an impasse on a range of issues
8526800 in francophone regions outside of montreal and quebec city its 35 for the conservatives and 33 for the bloc which means the conservatives have the opportunity to make gains
8526801 my expectation would be that we will have another minority i think thats the reality of the current political environment
8526802 simply thinking of a conservative majority sends a chill down the spine
8526803 people are not swooning over stephen harper but he is seen as being better than the alternative
8526804 i think a lot of people in canada have this idea of us in the senate as a bunch of drooling idiots wearing depends
8526805 its ridiculous the senate is filled with incredibly smart people with amazingly active minds many of whom are in their 70s the image is so far from the truth its not funny
8526806 as we get older we have so much more to offer intellectually i really believe that and i think one of the most important things you learn as you get older is you dont have all the answers the way you thought you did when you were younger
8526807 i think the older you get the more collaborative you become i think youre better able to see all sides of an issue you look to build consensus it just comes more naturally
8526808 what is his agenda nobody has any idea of what is his agenda
8526809 in de wedstrijd had ik niet zo veel pijn dus ik hoop dat ik straks weer hersteld ben
8526810 we have no tv ads that are airing right now
8526811 it gives you an advantage because you can prepare internally without letting on in an attempt to catch your opponents off guard
8526812 in the context of modern politics thats a pretty significant advantage
8526813 fixed election dates prevent governments from calling snap elections for short term political advantage
8526814 they level the playing field for all parties and the rules are clear for everybody
8526815 we have an increasingly difficult parliamentary situation because we have increasingly divergent views on a range of issues whether its the economy the environment the criminal justice system the view of our country in the world
8526816 those will obviously all be issues on which the various parties will contrast their positions when we get into an actual election campaign
8526817 city hall should be where that comes together but until now it hasnt been a place where everyone unites
8526818 how broad and inclusive vancouver is and how committed we are to making sure all communities are represented
8526819 i think vision will have to do a lot of work to get him elected by the mainstream the problem hell have is the west side its going to be a real uphill battle and its going to depend on whether he can bridge all those gaps
8526820 hes not a token candidate he has a real shot at winning
8526821 yo cuando voy a fichar voy de cara y directo entre el domingo y el lunes tuve una premiera certificaci n de que pod a darse el inter s del madrid yo llam para preguntarles porque a m nadie me llam el martes nos dedicamos a pensar qu pod amos hacer para buscar una soluci n y al final cazorla se queda
8526822 everything i learned in my eight years as president of the united states and in the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8526823 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world
8526824 people the world over have always been more impressed by the power of our example than by the example of our power
8526825 life is a 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8526826 his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8526827 barack obama will lead us away from division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope then join hillary chelsea and me in making senator barack obama the next president of the united states
8526828 with a growing economy and a growing population we are going to add spaces every year
8526829 these measures will send a clear message to the world canada takes responsibility for environmental protection and enforcement in our arctic waters
8526830 the proliferation of international shipping in the north raises the potential for shipwrecks smuggling illegal immigration and even threats to national security
8526831 but more specifically it raises the potential of environmental threats like oil spills poaching and contamination
8526832 this will give us jurisdiction over additional area roughly equivalent to the land mass of one of the prairie provinces
8526833 we are targeting another 58 people to be on the front lines
8526834 there is a role the u s have it available and we have it available here too if a processing facility wants to use it called pasteurization theres still some scientific discussions going on as to whether or not thats 100 per cent effective
8526835 inspectors verify cooking temperatures and observe and validate a companys sanitary practices the cfia also directly supervises the sample collection process in the plant
8526836 and while some might characterize that as paperwork i characterize that as an important element of an effective inspection system

8526871 our goal is to hand out as many books as we can to spread literacy give people access to good literature and knowledge about repairing bikes
8526872 baltimore csafe rec center was one of the most rewarding experiences for me it was a cookout and small bock party over there they helped us do two bike events where we repaired around 20 to 30 bikes
8526873 going to philadelphia is great this bike church is one of the biggest bike projects weve been to a lot of people show up and everything is so well organized
8526874 we really had no expectations in starting this project and the overall experience has just been amazing to me and more that we ever expected its overwhelming how many people came out and supported us
8526875 its been really helpful for many people we hope to inspire other people to do projects like this

8526903 i shot the movie in high definition and at most of the film festivals i went to i saw dim projection and a really small screen
8526904 the next generation of filmmakers are all shooting for the most part digitally
8526905 because thats where the medium is going these filmmakers are able to work more freely and faster than other filmmakers have before
8526906 we wanted to bring in all sorts of different genres and subgenres from narrative to documentaries to animation
8526907 the work flow is different in all of those of course but the presentation can be amazing in all of them
8526908 i get to blend creativity with essentially community organizing getting people to come and getting people excited about the festival
8526909 i enjoy telling them how its all worked out in hollywood and that it can work out
8526910 a lot of vendors are saying brides are cutting back people are planning smaller weddings cutting back on food some are just waiting it out
8526911 its been very steady for us theyre just spending a little less
8526912 i want it to be simple not overwhelming or too dramatic
8526913 theres nothing like being able to run my horses in my hometown
8526914 with the thoroughbreds back this is my third time here in a week
8526915 his dad said he was reading a racing form before he read a book
8526916 the fair circuit goes all over from santa rosa to stockton to not include the state fair was a travesty
8526917 horsemen were not sure if our track would be good thats understandable we hadnt run thoroughbreds in three years
8526918 and the states anabolic steroids ban went into effect that didnt help us either as horses had to be steroids free to compete there were a lot of questions
8526919 everybody sweats about coming up here ive been here on 106 107 degree days when you just melt
8526920 whether its a 5 000 or a 500 000 horse i just love racing
8526921 i was hoping they would think seriously about this place
8526922 its a great facility everything is already here the barn area has plenty of space it wouldnt take too much money to fix up that would make sense to me
8526923 we get maybe one or two customer complaints a year out of 78 000 calls
8526924 no taxi cab driver has that kind of record we have great people out there
8526925 if you break the pledge the people who voted for you will say excuse me not only did you raise my taxes but you lied to me
8526926 i will oppose and vote against any and all efforts to increase taxes
8526927 theyve put themselves in a box that leaves bush style borrowing as their only exit strategy
8526928 in part because of the pledge and what underlies it theyve limited their ability to be effective partners in government
8526929 nobody believes for 30 seconds that the tax cut really happens
8526930 republicans and democrats need to come out of their corners and compromise
8526931 there is no question they will hold your feet to the fire if you break that pledge
8526932 down the road whatever you run for it will haunt you
8526933 i think quite frankly with or without the pledge if they were to vote for a tax increase there would be consequences
8526934 i believe that every one of them is a man or woman of their word so no i dont expect that they would break a written contract with their constituents
8526935 without a wet winter well be seeing a lot more of this next year and more stringent conditions
8526936 it looks like the prognosticators are afraid to touch california right now
8526937 were not going to take a heavy hand but where we have chronic violators we will have measures in place to cite violators
8526938 dont worry about the grass being greener on the other side of the fence just make your own grass greener
8526939 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
8526940 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
8526941 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
8526942 females are the front line purchasers which makes them more sensitive to the actual cost of things
8526943 when theres not enough money it affects their wellbeing very quickly
8526944 theres a false sense of security thats certainly been evident
8526945 it gradually dawns on men that theres not enough money for a meal at a restaurant and then it has a knock on effect on their wellbeing
8526946 because seat belts can reduce the risk of injury and death in crashes by more than 50percent there is a critical need for interventions to increase seat belt use by teens as both drivers and passengers
8526947 there was nothing common left between that party and the ppp
8526948 the removal of musharraf was the binding point between the two parties and their split was quite natural after musharrafs resignation now he is thinking of watching his interests for the next elections
8526949 why should i not support them because they are the largest party and the people have given them the mandate in the last general elections also zardari fulfilled all his promises made to me
8526950 these changes are different and separate from the changes in thinking skills that occur as people get older
8526951 we found accelerated changes in peoples mental skills that indicated a terminal decline phase years before death
8526952 cardiovascular conditions such as heart disease or dementia that is too early to be detected could be factors
8526953 increased health problems and frailty in old age often lead to inactivity and this lack of exercise and mental stimulation could accelerate mental decline
8526954 this indicates that people remain stable in their verbal abilities unless they are experiencing disease processes that also increase their mortality risk
8526955 a change in verbal ability might therefore be considered a critical marker for degeneration in health in older people
8526956 the closing date for application is friday so we may have a lot more candidates
8526957 because of speculation among scientists that viral infections provoke the inflammation that increases the risk of macular degeneration we tested for associations between amd and tlr3 which is known to support innate immunity and host defence
8526958 if you are genetically susceptible to macular degeneration and are exposed to a virus that activates tlr3 it could lead to the death of cells in the macula ironically in some individuals using rnai to cure wet amd might actually increase the risk for blindness from dry amd
8526959 these findings pave the way for using tlr3 inhibitors as a potential new therapy for dry amd and simultaneously highlight the importance of critically assessing the potential risk posed to patients by rnai based therapies
8526960 what tlr3 does in the case of perceived infection is to sacrifice infected cells in this case retinal pigment epithilial cells to protect the neighborhood biologically well intentioned though the sacrifice may be it can lead to blindness
8526961 given its high prevalence in the united states and the world finding effective prevention and treatment strategies for amd is of critical importance this finding represents a major advancement in our understanding of dry amd for which effective treatment is not yet available
8526962 evidence shows that around three million years ago there was an increase in the amount of rock and debris deposited on the ocean floor around greenland
8526963 these rocks could not have got there until icebergs started to form and could transport them indicating that large amounts of ice on greenland only began to form about three million years ago
8526964 prior to that greenland was largely ice free and probably covered in grass and forest furthermore atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were relatively high so the question we wanted to answer was why did greenland become covered in an ice sheet
8526965 that is sort of the major achievement or milestone that we all had to reach
8526966 id like to hear and i would love to be a member of the research team or community that does define an efficacious therapy but i think it needs to be approached with enormous caution
8526967 tens of thousands of people could be in line for a refund
8526968 it wasnt a huge amount of money but it was ours
8526969 the genesis for this was chucks real feeling that this was an unfair position
8526970 i think now people are beginning to realize that this has got to be the largest fraud backed up by intimidation and extortion and by the sheer force of taking peoples property and hard earned money without any lawful authorization whatsoever
8526971 these snake oil peddlers have conned millions of dollars out of many well intended patriots and left a trail of broken lives in their wake these charlatans should be avoided not only because they will lead you to bankruptcy and prison but because by association they discredit those who are telling the truth
8526972 the founding fathers intentionally restricted the taxing powers of the new federal government as a measure of restraint on its size by exceeding that limited taxing authority the federal government has been able to obtain resources beyond its intended reach and that money has enabled the federal government to exceed its authority
8526973 theres no law making the average working man liable for income taxes theres no law or regulation that allows the irs to contend that earnings are 100 percent profit received in exchange for nothing and the right to earn a living through any lawful occupation is a constitutionally protected fundamental right and it is exempt from taxation
8526974 the criminal investigation division and department of justice both responded only with your position is frivolous i had never stated a position so how could they know whether it was frivolous
8526975 imagine my sending you a bill for 1 000 and when you call me and ask what the bill was for i simply said that position is frivolous just write the check and send it in
8526976 it is definitely a trade what most people receive in the form of wages salaries or in my case fees that they personally earned for their labor is not received in exchange for nothing
8526977 the irs lets wal mart sell a trillion dollars worth of goods but they can back out their cost of goods before being taxed
8526978 the irs considers in the case of a wal mart wage earner 100 percent of what he takes in is profit
8526979 but hes using his life energy and work lifespan and depleting it as he goes
8526980 working is a god given fundamental right that is protected under the constitution and cant be taxed any more than exercising freedom of speech
8526981 i have started a campaign to unify the work and weve got a number of organizations that are sponsoring and supporting this campaign
8526982 read your constitution and you will see that the federal role does not include any authority to regulate or tax any citizen directly and that we expressly reserved the right to rule and govern ourselves as states not as mere political subdivisions
8526983 the constitution does not allow the government to run your lives but the money it is stealing from millions of americans is the fuel for its over reaching and kibitzing take the money back and we and our states and communities can again be free
8526984 volleyball has constantly changed its game to get on tv
8526985 i think that beach volleyballs popularity has more to do with what theyre wearing
8526986 i definitely think its possible if we put the effort into it we can definitely play off beach volleyballs increased attention
8526987 there are various types of fences near the gorges on campus there are two fences built to restrict access to former pathways the newest one is about 15 feet long and 8 feet tall at the trailhead near the west campus fraternity fiji its intention was to warn of dangers below and decommission the trail as the trail served no purpose except to allow access to a dangerous natural area where we responded to multiple deaths in the past few years
8526988 cornell has been part of a task force lead by the city of ithaca gorge safety is not only a cornell community issue but a city wide problem
8526989 the decision to build the fence was made jointly by a number of people including city officials senior administrators and cupd
8526990 gorges are one of cornells defining features but they also represent a safety concern fall creek gorge will be reopened when the community realizes the dangers of the gorges
8526991 ive received a couple of letters from alumni some who were concerned about promoting gorge safety and others who wanted to know why the fence was put up
8526992 signs prohibiting access have been stolen and a hole has been cut in the fence additionally people have clearly attempted to circumvent the fence putting themselves in significant danger of serious physical injury or death due to the treacherous terrain
8526993 a fence isnt going to stop people from swimming in the gorges students have been swimming here for decades if people want to swim they will
8526994 if a fence helps to prevent the death of another student im all for it even at the cost of my own recreation
8526995 the risks are real and the warning signs are in place for very real reasons there is little more devastating than having to talk to the parents of a bright young person and tell them that their son or daughter died while engaged in risky behavior
8526996 when there is so much to do and so much available for fun and relaxation circumventing preventative devices and ignoring warnings at great risk to oneself is simply not worth the potential price
8526997 the university and the union recognize their mutual obligations under affirmative action statutes
8526998 is columbia university going to fence off the streets of new york city whenever something tragic happens
8526999 schedulizer is down because cornell has made it prohibitively difficult for us to maintain accurate course information
8527000 weve been talking with david yeh vice president for student and academic services since the end of last semester
8527001 we tried to cooperate as much as possible with them but they made it really difficult the registrar has dropped the ball we dont really have a choice
8527002 we have made our best efforts to work with the university registrar to arrive at an acceptable solution to keep schedulizer running but the registrar has been unresponsive
8527003 we know that many of you depend on schedulizer to schedule your classes and believe us when we say we really really didnt want to do this
8527004 were not helping them do their work thats not our responsibility
8527005 its a commercial company they have resources we did give them an approved location to give them information
8527006 as one of the top colleges im glad we use scheduling software as user friendly and compatible as peoplesoft
8527007 oh my god i didnt get a chance to print my schedule yet im going to cry
8527008 if cornell is responsible for this they have found yet another way to make enrolling in classes more difficult
8527009 please if schedulizer is important to you send an email to the registrar at univreg cornell edu let them know ask them to work with us to bring schedulizer back
8527010 many athletes who play club sports are just as if not more talented than some varsity athletes
8527011 the difference is the competitive edge true athletes are competitive and when youre competitive you want to compete against the best
8527012 its like the weight room you dont walk in and squat 300 pounds you work with the bar first get your form down and add weight
8527013 freshman year is about getting your form down besides good competition always rises quickly
8527014 when youre faced with the decision of whether to put off your homework and stay up late you have to think about how it will detriment the team
8527015 they cant go out all night drinking when they have practice in the morning but rower friends are ridiculously dedicated friends
8527016 it helps a lot in the sense that you meet more people on other teams
8527017 theres a lot of camaraderie and thats part of why youre doing it
8527018 doing the whole sitting on the erg thing is tough but being in a boat on the water of cayuga lake is one of the most rewarding things ive done at cornell
8527019 wont know anything in september but by november the best ones are giving the recruits a run for their money it all depends on their drive to pull hard
8527020 heart is more important to me than brawn well make you strong as long as youre willing to work hard
8527021 i think what you get out of a varsity sport are the people you meet and how you learn to conduct yourself with discipline i think what you take from it is far superior to any sacrifice you make
8527022 in the course of the morning performance degraded to a point where students effectively were not able to access add drop
8527023 cit and the our continue to analyze the many components of our set up to ascertain the root cause of the performance problem
8527024 what could be more disruptive when the university is poised to begin the academic year than to have the system that enrolls students not working properly
8527025 the fact that the system got bogged down created some high anxiety so i probably got around 200 e mails saying help
8527026 we have a problem which has been exacerbated by the computer glitches
8527027 the program should be able to accommodate everyone it shouldnt crash after a minute and a half
8527028 i tried at 8 30 a m and 9 00 a m 10 00 a m and 11 00 a m
8527029 add drop access was opened by 10 00 a m as noted in an e mail to students and on various information channels many students were encouraged by their friends to go into add drop at the traditional time of 6 30 a m even though it was not opened
8527030 access into studentcenter cornell edu is normal and there is no apparent degradation of performance we will continue to monitor performance with cit
8527031 we all truly regret that students experiences this morning did not meet theirs or our high expectations
8527032 while considerable testing of load functionality and performance was completed over several weeks and many person hours of analysis and planning we too are disappointed with this experience
8527033 its a good fit for me i will draw on my experience from cornell
8527034 and increasing the affordability and accessibility of education to our country and the world i have been fortunate to be involved with major strategic initiatives and have had great leaders i look forward to being involved with the national issues concerning higher education and working with cornell university
8527035 carolyn ainslies contributions are too numerous and too significant to list she has served cornell for over 20 years and has been the right hand to two provosts don randel and me
8527036 what makes her unique is the combination of intelligence breadth and depth of knowledge about cornell her devotion to the core missions of a research university her collaborative spirit her attention to detail and understanding of the big picture her can do attitude her creativity and her intellectual curiosity
8527037 cornells paul streeter and his colleagues will pick up the ball and ensure a smooth transition and a bright future for the functions for which carolyn has been responsible
8527038 financial aid faculty recruitment and retention space planning long range budget and capital planning will surely be at the top of the list
8527039 i hope to provide leadership and support for the financial needs of the university
8527040 ainslie did a great job up to this point and were focused not on any major changes but continue to plan the finances of the university and other institutional planning
8527041 we believe that barack obama is a global celebrity who has a lot of fans out there
8527042 i get you i get where youre coming from and i get what your issues are
8527043 americans no matter the age will see that john mccain is ready to lead this country and barack obama is not
8527044 we spent the summer putting together a response to president david skortons letter
8527045 initial design plans are complete such as the dimensions of the offices their location the location of the rest room and kitchenette and a tentative idea of what will be placed in each room
8527046 we are hopeful that the university will still fund the initial construction costs
8527047 represent a space where the rich and diverse asian community can come together build bridges create programming celebrate cultural heritage and outreach to all members of the cornell community
8527048 he had fallen into a deep cynicism over what had crossed his path plotted the imperfectability of man and read shaw and chesterton enough to keep his mind from the edges of decadence now suddenly all his mental processes of the last year and a half seemed stale and futile a petty consummation of himself
8527049 it is part of chinas worsening crackdown in the area
8527050 the international community should prevent the chinese government from carrying out their systematic crackdown policies on the uighurs
8527051 mohon maaf lahir bathin untuk semua temen temen hendri yang membaca blog ini maafkan apabila ada kata kata yang tidak pada tempatnya semoga disaat kita memasuki bulan suci nanti hati kita telah bersih dari amarah benci dan dendam

8527053 you know ive cleverly inserted myself in the roll of the governors speakers
8527054 because we have an open seat in 2010 and the democrats feel this california governorship is theirs to be had this convention will be an important proving ground for the wannabes

8527075 we like to provide as many services as possible for free
8527076 were more open about approaching and bringing services in to ps3 and psp
8527077 we cant support all the needs of the consumer and there are great companies providing services on the pc already so were very open to provide the opportunity to those companies to reach our user base as well
8527078 we like to provide as many services as possible for free we already provide our network access for gameplay for free and the interesting thing about the network side and the internet business is that theres a variety of revenue sources
8527079 not necessarily getting people to pay but with advertising and so on
8527080 those are things were looking at and learning how we can provide a service without people having to pay but we still get our operation running with funding from somewhere so that we can maintain the level of quality we want

8527084 there were no signs of trauma or foul play well be doing toxicology and other tests which will take up to six weeks
8527085 they had no right to use his name or photo he is not the spokesperson
8527086 but i cant picture us still being beatles when were 30 years old
8527087 when we opened in 69 the average age of our clients was 23 today its probably around 27 and thats taking a lot of people whove been listing their age as 25 for the last six or seven years at their word
8527088 ive never thought that much about age i mean ive always really liked chuck berry and he must be closing in on 50 by now
8527089 i dont think anybody would get real upset if they found out ill be 30 in a couple of weeks but why take a chance
8527090 shell kill me if you print this but our drummer is
8527091 did you see dave edmunds and rockpile at the roxy a couple of months ago or carl perkins at the whisky i didnt hear anybody calling them too old did you you could put four 59 year old men together and if they rocked like that nobody would call them old
8527092 throughout history men have been reaching their peaks at around 33 look at mozart and alexander the great and jesus if only people under 30 were allowed to play it it would be rocks loss
8527093 a couple of times when i was broke i had to join groups that were more like 9 to 5 punch in punch out jobs than music
8527094 but everybody kept asking me why i wasnt playing until i realized that i wasnt being true to my school as the beach boys would say that playing the guitar is what im really around to do
8527095 this is the last group ill ever be in full time if we dont get signed im going to find myself a nice well paying probably deathly boring job and live comfortably again ive done enough starving

8527186 jag gillar att mikael holmkvist skrivit den h r rliga boken och jag gillade att l sa den
8527187 jag kommer aldrig att bos tta mig permanent i england det r helt klart
8527188 man f r bara ett kort solsken innan det r alldeles molnigt igen vintrarna r milda men p somrarna n r temperaturen s llan ver 20 grader och det regnar regnar regnar
8527189 i framtiden skulle jag vilja testa mig sj lv i en annan toppliga jag funderar p spanien d r finns det tminstone ingen anledning att klaga p v dret i england s ger de att manchester r regnets stad dess stora attraktion ska vara tidtabellen p j rnv gsstationen d r t gen ker till andra mindre regniga st der
8527190 det r inte enbart v dret som jag r missn jd med h r
8527191 i ryssland och serbien r folks levnadss tt lika i england r det helt annorlunda h r har de helt enkelt inte tid att k nna livets gl dje
8527192 under hela veckan arbetar de alla s h rt de pratar bara med folk vid luch rasterna sedan p kv llen kommer de hem och ser p tv s att de kan g upp tidigt till jobbet n sta dag
8527193 enda g ngen man kan tr ffa v nner r p helgerna men f r fotbollsspelare r det den mest upptagna tiden det var mycket enklare att st lla om till ryssland n till england i england hade jag ingen att prata med den f rsta m naden var s rskilt sv r jag bodde ensam p ett hotell som jag bara l mnade f r tr ning jag trodde att jag skulle bli galen inom de fyra v ggarna
8527194 jag vill bara g ra klart att jag inte har sagt dessa saker jag pratade om sv righeterna jag hade med att komma in i livet i manchester men det reflekterar inte hur jag k nner nu
8527195 jag njuter v ldigt mycket av livet som fotbollsspelare med manchester united och jag r v ldigt glad att vara en del av den h r fantastiska klubben jag tror jag visar det med s ttet som jag spelar p varje vecka jag har ocks alldeles f r mycket respekt f r folket i manchester och england f r att kritisera de p det h r viset

8527202 going surfing is a big part of my creative process
8527203 surfing has always been a big part of my life ive surfed since i was nine years old leaving land is my favorite part of it i like being in a separate reality
8527204 its still my favorite thing to listen to a story through a song its like nothing else a song can preserve time and memory and history in a way that words or a picture alone cant a song can capture it all
8527205 it was a great time and a life changing time for me i felt like i had a peer group not only did i identify as far as politics and music but also age wise i had been with people because they were lesbian and women and we had a lot in common but they were all a lot older so for once i fit in where could a freak fit in in punk rock
8527206 so i came back from san francisco and the only people i knew here were lesbians and no way man i wanted punk rock i started going out to punk shows i would put on a little suit and tie and i would go there and try to look so cool though i didnt know a soul
8527207 he walks up to me and says hey want to be in a band
8527208 the fashions changed and the politics changed and people were wearing the swastika which they hadnt been up to that time because im jewish i would notice and it pissed me off so i wrote a song called take off your swastika it was right around the same time the dead kennedys wrote nazi punks fuck off i wrote the song as a direct personal reaction to the swastikas and i decided to play it on my acoustic guitar up til then id been playing electric guitar and synthesizer nobody in punk was really playing acoustic guitar at that time and the reason i did it was because i really wanted the words to be heard because as far as im concerned punk rock is the folk music of today though i didnt play it at some folk club i played it at punk rock clubs
8527209 people would yell and id get heckled and stuff but on the whole it was pretty great i remember playing at the whisky and seeing a couple of guys taking off their swastikas

8527241 there was an escape plan we dont know whether that intelligence came from staff or inmates we do know it went all the way up the chain of command all the way to the executive director of correctional operations
8527242 there was lots of rumble out there that something was going to happen
8527243 what happened was the inmates refused to co operate with staff when they were trying to enter the unit so it took some time for staff to get into the unit and then clear the inmates out it wasnt a riot it was more unco operative in nature
8527244 being trusting people we assumed safeway had taken care of it
8527245 saya tak punya keraguan sama sekali kalau kami bakal kompetitif di semua lini

8527252 we have worked very closely with a lot of community groups to try to drive down these sorts of attacks
8527253 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8527254 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy

8527268 sin embargo no nos ha recibido pero si contin a el hostigamiento y las presiones sabremos responder para defender nuestros derechos
8527269 por qu este tribunal tiene que hacer una labor del poder judicial y encima cuando la hace el presidente del poder judicial dice que nos metemos en todo digo esto porque no he escuchado del idl una cr tica al pj por haber declarado prescritos los delitos he escuchado s cr ticas contra el tc que es el que finalmente le enmienda la plana al pj por qu esa injusticia contra estos siete magistrados del tc
8527270 por qu tanta prensa contra el tribunal constitucional y no contra el poder judicial que es el que cre este problema seg n ustedes ac en el tc leemos los peri dicos todos los d as y no recuerdo que el idl haya hecho cr ticas a la sentencia que nos convoca el d a de hoy

8527274 c mo le consta a usted que hay presi n sobre este tribunal
8527275 no puede ser de otra manera as que cuide sus palabras porque ofende usted la majestad de este pleno m s a n cuando declara el mismo d a en que se va a dar la audiencia eso suena a chantaje no es tico hablar de la majestad de un tc como este que defiende la constituci n y los tratados internacionales de derechos humanos a trav s de los medios ning n medio de comunicaci n nos va a presionar

8527296 moscow has laid the foundations for the occupation of crimea with years of careful propaganda its like hitlers excuse of helping the ethnic germans in the sudetenland as justification for the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1938 i have no doubt that now that the georgian conflict is over russia aims to take over crimea the level of hatred against anything ukrainian here is astonishing many people have been attacked in the street for merely speaking ukrainian you can talk french german or chinese here without problems but if you speak ukrainian people often come up and start insulting you
8527297 je demande que le s nateur obama soit choisi par cette convention par acclamation

8527341 i think the convention has gone pretty well so far what do you think
8527342 my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8527343 barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8527344 with eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together in one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8527345 reminded us of what its like when you actually put people first
8527346 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it will not work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8527347 venice 2008 is one of the clearest illustrations to date of the identity crisis the traditional all inclusive film festival is facing it has been clear for some time that the age of the auteur is over these days even dedicated high frequency viewers generally choose films by buzz rather than director
8527348 cinema is almost no longer cinema the type of classic contemporary cinema such as venice seemed designed to support has finally run out of steam the idea of a modern cinema that lasts 50 years is a contradiction in terms
8527349 we go look for the vitality of cinema wherever it is hidden be it in popular works or in auteur cinema it makes no difference to us
8527350 what you manage to accomplish at cannes and to a lesser extent at venice is a great junket but in venice the hotels are obscenely expensive and not very good it costs a fortune to rent interview space and the service is appalling then youve got the cost of the boats because all of the really big stars want to stay at the cipriani
8527351 the choices i made this year confirm an identity for the festival
8527352 but i definitely want venice to stay pluralistic and contradictory
8527353 if you let santoro in then you have a tough match i wanted to try and bully the ball around and try and get on top of him early i felt i did that
8527354 i am going to stop using birth control just letting you know
8527355 your stalling on kids has me feeling bitter like you married me under false pretenses
8527356 im sick of all this sunshine and jerk chicken and great music pack the dominoes were going to dudley
8527357 when i was young i didnt like my face so they moved my nose to a different place
8527358 im mad im mad one sandwich short of a picnic
8527359 the bottom line is we dont have a job if we dont entertain
8527360 in my mind thats as big a part of the job as shooting under par
8527361 it is important for sponsors to be able to interact with players and have a positive experience
8527362 i appreciate the winners check and all of your support
8527363 i think the accomplishment is secure because we know what we have done
8527364 but soccer in the united states was so small then philadelphia was an exception because the city and the media really showed interest in the team
8527365 i just look at it as a really good experience we know what it meant to us and the fact that these people still make a commitment 35 years later to come together really speaks about the camaraderie we had with each other
8527366 we had discussions about it many times and i still dont know just how it all came about
8527367 i will pat myself on the back when i say i did pick some great americans those kids had hearts bigger than lions
8527368 we american players were kids and had no frame of reference
8527369 i knew nothing about the other teams or the caliber of play
8527370 without question it was the most traumatic time ive ever faced as a coach
8527371 to lose those players was devastating but we had gotten that far and preached all year that it doesnt matter who is on the field
8527372 ive won five championship rings in my lifetime and that was without question the most special
8527373 its an incredible story an expansion team winning in the fashion we did is our legacy
8527374 you have to remember that in 1973 soccer was not even on the horizon
8527375 i can understand why it has been forgotten because of the history of soccer in the united states
8527376 i think its going to go down to the end
8527377 i think its going to be a good race its going to be a good fight
8527378 its who wants it and who plays the best i guess
8527379 games like that weve got to win who knows it could
8527380 weve got santana weve got a big load weve got to go get it
8527381 the other team gives you inspiration lets put it that way
8527382 and when youre able to take that and keep yourself motivated it helps
8527383 but there wasnt a real big deal made out of it well i take that back one of the coaches was yelling it wasnt that big of a deal for everybody else
8527384 theres no place like home and a home and home and home
8527385 the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi
8527386 could i just mention to you jay a moment of seriousness i spent 51 2 years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those 51 2 years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8527387 cindy i refuse to take out the garbage i lived in garbage for 51 2 years
8527388 to those who impugn my honor by pointing out that i now support permanent bush tax cuts for the rich after having voted against them i need only mention that after all the suffering i endured for 51 2 years i have now earned the right to change my mind
8527389 one of the things ive never tried to do is exploit my vietnam service to my country because it would be totally inappropriate to do so
8527390 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
8527391 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change barack obama will deliver that change
8527392 im pretty sure it was when my sister was at ursuline academy in wilmington delaware and joe was at archmere academy claymont
8527393 closely connected with cities through his leadership on crime issues
8527394 is like 98 percent he brings an open door evaluation of obama to every working family
8527395 that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
8527396 has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
8527397 i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman
8527398 as a christian for me as a christian its also a sacred union
8527399 equality in relationship family and adoption rights is not some abstract principle thats why we have to repeal laws like the defense of marriage act thats why we have to extend equal treatment in our family and adoption laws
8527400 dear fans in columbus i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now

8527404 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that

8527411 the question is whether they could find a single tenant or would have to multitenant the space
8527412 and with the money they could lose subletting the floor they could buy a lot of advertising on billboards in downtown philadelphia to get their name out

8527422 theres always this one upmanship trying to get a little bit faster and a little bit harder with successive genres
8527423 i know that some dubstep guys are at 145 bpm now its what journalist simon reynolds calls the zone of fruitless intensification and its a little bit pointless you can achieve a sense of momentum without really needing to go faster and harder our album feels faster or slower or uptempo or quite stripped back but actually every track on the album is the same tempo which is 138 bpm

8527612 we believe that the justice system will prevail and that our client will be found innocent
8527613 this case has no weight its a web of lies
8527614 a jury was able to see that and come to the correct verdict
8527615 we thought there was certainly enough evidence to convict this person of this crime the jury chose to ignore it
8527616 im not saying its a conspiracy but you know what it certainly gives pause and gives a motive

8527637 i also never imagined there would be a day that we would actually be able to get married
8527638 i am devastated but i take some solace in knowing we were able to enjoy the ultimate rite of love and commitment before she passed
8527639 we would not have marriage equality in california if it werent for del and phyllis they fought and triumphed in many battles
8527640 through it all their love and commitment to each other was an inspiration to all who knew them

8527690 once a word is in the microsoft spell checker theres a notion out there that that word is now official and the word is now important we dont take that stance internally but that attitude exists in the world and we have to take it into account
8527691 theres no amount of logic that we would ever build into the speller that would suggest that we wouldnt do that
8527692 most of the time the cupertino effect happens because of proper names which are really difficult for a dictionary to handle

8527792 lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8527793 this is something people like me have been waiting for for days weeks years
8527794 hes going to the white house hes going to be our next president
8527795 now sen obamas life is a 21st century incarnation of the old fashioned american dream his achievements are proof of our continuing progress toward the more perfect union of our founders dreams
8527796 barack obama will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years back to unity and hope
8527797 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8527798 and heres what i have to say about that everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8527799 the most effective and the most important speech bill clinton has delivered since he left the white house
8527800 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8527801 i profoundly disagree with the direction that john wants to take the country
8527802 we are going to hope for the best but were preparing for the worst
8527803 nagin said at the convention wednesday noting that the u s army corps of engineers have been rebuilding the levees breached during katrina
8527804 this will be a good test for us i wish we didnt have to take this test
8527805 everybody should be looking at their plans just like were looking at our plans and get ready
8527806 if they dont have a plan you still have time if you wait until the storms on top of you thats when panics going to set in and you dont think wisely
8527807 although we have made strides in rebuilding our infrastructure the levees have not been fully repaired and we have an 800 million budget gap to complete our sewage and water systems
8527808 the citizens should not be worried about the flooding again
8527809 we definitely dont want to wait until saturday or sunday to decide what to do
8527810 as long as theres a chance that well be in this storms path ill be here in louisiana
8527811 im going to make sure im here personally to help lead the preparation efforts and if necessary any recovery efforts that are necessary after the fact
8527812 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8527813 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8527814 it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as it is great and fantastic
8527815 im not against it so long as it never gets in the way of the tv show if it got in the way of the show that would be appalling
8527816 hey shock and awe at what target did to me hear my story
8527817 youll never believe what they put in your coffee these days coming up at 11
8527818 my 10 coupon doesnt work just you wait till the internet hears about this
8527819 but the thing is to try to be good mentally and physically because i think i am playing good tennis
8527820 the first round always is difficult and hopefully next round i play much better
8527821 i am thrilled to pave the way for california drivers to obtain insurance that is more environmentally friendly and more accurately reflects driving habits
8527822 as a strong advocate of healthy market competition and a healthy environment i am especially pleased to encourage this kind of innovation and additional options for consumers
8527823 in concept this is something we think is a good approach
8527824 a drivers mileage will lower auto insurance premiums particularly when the high cost of gasoline is encouraging people to drive less
8527825 the new series of torchwood is hugely bold and promises to be bigger and better than ever the audience is in for an amazing ride
8527826 this series is one big serial and the most ambitious story weve ever made and weve got plenty of surprises in store
8527827 each time they call me the pharmacy calls me or the police department calls me i always tell them one thing pursue the patient and arrest them
8527828 no i dont think so at all i think it calls attention to what needs to be happening the problem with politics is that its left a lot of people on the sidelines and people feel neglected and this is a very good way to galvenize the people through civil disobedience
8527829 two specials in america with a u s setting and u s assistant will take it to another level
8527830 david tennant is already gaining a huge following and this will make him really hot property
8527831 the british pound is trading strong against the american dollar which means doing business including filming is much cheaper to do in the united states than it is in england

8527833 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy my dad can be that guy but its not him i think that almost discredited who he is as an artist
8527834 get a glass from a cupboard in her kitchen and the whole piece of furniture fell off the wall on top of her cutting her temple and hitting her in the left eye
8527835 the only reason she did it is because she had a psychotic breakdown this is something that could have happened to anyone
8527836 i think its because they can see that she was sick and this wasnt somebody thinking in her right mind you know doing these things
8527837 he requires constant care when i say constant care i mean twenty four hours a day it is truly 24 7
8527838 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing

8527842 het was een warme dag in juli 1943 de terrasdeuren van de pastorie stonden open ik hoorde zware stappen in het grind keek door het raam naar buiten en zag een grote groep ssers onze kant op komen mijn moeder poogde nog wapens in de dakgoot te verstoppen maar het was al te laat
8527843 ik was destijds in de kost in zetten waar ik op school zat toen mijn moeder werd opgepakt was ik net een dag terug in hasselt
8527844 ik wilde niet weten wat er in die pakketjes zat hoe minder je wist hoe veiliger je was

8527854 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8527855 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8527856 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8527857 and just in case youre wondering president clinton reminded us of what it is when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8527858 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks how insulting how pathetic how desperate
8527859 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right
8527860 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver change
8527861 declare together in one voice right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8527873 they are probably a top four team with everybody fit and playing well
8527874 were preparing for the hull weve played over the last few years not the hull lying 11th in the table because the personnel has not changed that much theyve got internationals throughout their squad
8527875 weve got quality in our team as well and i think its more about concentrating on what we can do rather than worrying about hull
8527876 the older you get the more you appreciate it its going to be a special weekend
8527877 people expect so much weve created that expectation with the way weve been performing in recent years but thats a good place to be
8527878 weve got players used to performing on the big stage and hopefully that will work in our favour
8527879 last year was difficult for us because nobody expected catalans to win
8527880 there was so much pressure around us in the build up and there was more relief than anything at the end of the game
8527881 all of those things that a department head would do we feel that they should be done on site
8527882 having a large organization that is many miles away takes away from that centralized singular command of the operation
8527883 residents should be relieved as will commuters and visitors who use the well traveled route

8527885 there will be seven statewide teams visiting businesses for whom we have a record and addresses
8527886 we estimate that there are between 3 percent and 5 percent noncompliance rate of businesses in california
8527887 they can charge less for their products because they are not paying the tax and that puts the others at a disadvantage
8527888 but these figures also mean that about 97 percent of the businesses are in compliance
8527889 it is a densely populated area it was part of the original pilot program and we want to continue and follow up on our efforts
8527890 a two part question looking ahead a few days who do you think john mccain will pick as his veep and does joe biden help or hurt obama
8527891 if he feels i can contribute then i will i know im behind guys like jeff withey chase budinger jordan hill and pretty much all the people already there
8527892 theyre all tremendous players and any way i can help them would be awesome to me all i need is the opportunity if it leads to something from there great
8527893 hes going to have to go there and work hard prove to them hes worth being on scholarship coach olson has said he has a huge upside and its true its hard to find as athletic 6 foot 8 guys like he is
8527894 arizona started talking to me back in january but it was always about a walk on position
8527895 i just always wanted to be offered a scholarship from them my dream was to get a college scholarship
8527896 these young men come from situations and backgrounds other schools might not ever imagine
8527897 but what we stress to them here from day one is how to carry themselves in a respectful way and the payoff is years later when they become productive adults years after some dumb friday night football game
8527898 we know our work is cut out for us but im not sticking around unless i feel i can still be useful somehow and that isnt going to happen if im not trying to prepare these kids to win games

8527900 we have a lot of playmakers four preseason i aa all americans were also returning key players from last year
8527901 im dedicating this game to my friends and family in phoenix the people who have a lot to do with my career
8527902 it is a challenge for our program make no mistake about it
8527903 one of the positives is that this gives us an opportunity to go against the best
8527904 jose has got to remain focused to what happens on the baseball field it is certainly inappropriate to engage in any conversation with the fans during a game
8527905 i think last year they didnt have the points system quite right with guys not being able to move enough a la rich beem and this year it seems like the players think its a little too much movement
8527906 but certainly theyve created some drama some guys are going to be thinking about just making the cut this week guys wouldnt probably be thinking about that normally
8527907 i heard he was coming and im thinking a nascar guy
8527908 but i thought he was great he drew great analogies between nascar and football he drew a lot of points we could identify with
8527909 the biggest thing is communication you have to be in touch with your teammates and know what they are doing without ever saying a word
8527910 i have to be in constant contact with the pit crew
8527911 he knows what it takes to win championships winning a championship in anything you do is extremely difficult at the highest level
8527912 he has what it takes to be special it takes a lot of people and you need a good support team
8527913 it started when i was a kid i like nascar a lot it is exciting people have a wrong perspective of it
8527914 we want to win more this year that is what they say to you in racing too
8527915 some people are into that kind of thing some people just like that kinky kind of shit we see everything as officers
8527916 she says we need to go find him but shes wrong
8527917 i never write the yankees off until the seasons over and the standings are set
8527918 theyve been around too long and been in the playoffs for such a long time that were definitely not counting them out
8527919 it couldnt have been any worse the first two games but weve got to come back thursday
8527920 i started working at a driving range got a hold of a teacher to help me out he said
8527921 i hit balls and hit balls 400 to 700 a day on days off from work i was there it was kind of a natural fit
8527922 i had a good par on 10 then the eagle and i was back in the hunt
8527923 i hit some loose shots but a good one on no 17 and a 10 foot birdie putt then a 3 wood and iron to 15 feet and almost made the putt for par on no 18 and i was happy with that
8527924 i thought about 10 under would win and i was right griffith said
8527925 my leg was straight and i couldnt bend it the muscle was in spasm and i had a lot of pain
8527926 as you can see i am completely out of breath she really pushed me to the limit
8527927 tavitas a lot better in year two in the system than he was in year one
8527928 i expect him to be even better a month from now four months from now and a year from now tavita has an excellent grasp of the offense
8527929 the number one thing you would have to say is the difference in lyle from this year to last year is confidence
8527930 that then relates right into speed of play and decision making understanding and the ability to take something that has happened and transform it into a positive
8527931 thats the way its been predominantly a lot of the time
8527932 i think they kind of skip over me i like that because its less pressure for me we just do the best we can stay under the radar i guess and see what we can do
8527933 we still just havent got the chemistry between he and the crew chief and the team that we rebuilt to be where its at its absolute best but theyre very close to being able to do the deal
8527934 if we could just win a race and get that behind us i think everybody would be a little bit more relaxed
8527935 the reason he hasnt won is just because we havent had our cars fast enough but hes been close
8527936 he should have won two or three times this year maybe he can be a contender for a championship and have the best part of his year after the chase starts
8527937 it was a long green run day and i ran third the rest of the day
8527938 but a lap down third and every time the caution would come out the leaders were passing lapped cars again and i never got the lucky dog
8527939 marked enlargement of his heart which had been failing for some time
8527940 for matt and myself itd be nice knowing what the situation would be and be able to move forward with it the way i look at it more than anything the sooner it can happen the sooner we can get past the interviews and media coverage that goes with it and you can prepare for the game
8527941 we know its getting close and you get that anxiety and excitement knowing the decision has to be made soon i am sure coach understands that and hell make the decision as soon as its necessary
8527942 hopefully well get in enough snaps with the first offensive line that both can play
8527943 i just wanted to make sure kurt gets his timing with the ones for this game much like we did in kansas city
8527944 we didnt have him in team work tuesday but he did fine and hasnt experienced any problems
8527945 theyre in last place and to get swept against that team theyre playing good they hit at the right time and made pitches at the right time were going to have to play better
8527946 im not going to say it was a bad pitch
8527947 weve got gerut up there who kills us but if we walk him
8527948 weve got adrian gonzalez as a possible pinch hitter right behind him hes their best hitter
8527949 dosty is a game changer and did not play at all last year
8527950 the league is so competitive right now were just trying to keep bodies healthy and do as much as we can to continue to get better
8527951 paige is at a different level already she has a great competitive mind
8527952 most of our kids live with single parents who work
8527953 i am worried about them i do think some will go home to an empty house everything we do is prevention our kids are all at risk
8527954 shutting down for a month will help us well save between 20 000 and 30 000
8527955 a lot of their parents dont speak english and arent able to help them with homework
8527956 if this isnt around in the long term id worry about their grades dropping and about them getting into trouble
8527957 its a place where i can do homework and play and read books
8527958 my son has adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and hes had a lot of problems in day care and after school programs
8527959 this place has been a godsend for us they have taught and enforced the social skills he needed hes more understanding of the needs of others i feel this place is full of angels they love and care for him
8527960 the kids who live around here would be like running in the streets
8527961 it would be horrible after 60 years to say were closing down

8527970 lacking understanding of human rights children are bullied and sometimes experience racial discrimination and even more violent forms of abuse as they grow up children must know it is their right to defend themselves from abuse and there are many organizations that will step in to protect them if abuse is occurring
8527971 an absence of human rights stained the hands of governments and threatened their rules very few governments have implemented any part of the universal declaration of human rights these governments have not grasped that their very survival depends utterly upon adopting such reforms and thus giving their peoples a cause a civilization worth supporting worth their patriotism

8527986 inherently complex and paradoxical on the one hand there is the magnificence of russian authors artists and composers from tolstoy to repin to rachmaninov pasternak to faberg to mussorgsky on the other though we must grapple with the specter of communist russia the terrors of the gulag concentration camps and the soviet unions paralyzing economic and cultural inertia
8527987 in a nation still tyrannized by secret police and rigid government controls empathy and compassion seem far away a more fulfilling identity is surely to be found where such notions are central
8527988 perhaps the greatest lesson is that despite its strength and religious heritage russias identity like so many identities the world over has persistently lacked the sustainable moral element that underlies a sense of community which in turn is central to a sense of identity who we are and where we fit in the greater scheme of things

8528020 its a very unusual situation where a company would be trying to compare its own drugs
8528021 im not sure usual situations are all that relevant in this particular case
8528022 good news is that the board supports the proposed studies
8528023 the fact that we are comparing your drugs and you are not involved is very awkward and can easily give way to anti genentech sentiments
8528024 the leaders of this study are only interested in answering the many scientific and patient management questions that we face with our patients every day but some investigators and the press want this study to be more than that your involvement would be very helpful to both of our causes

8528077 the market will probably receive it well that fannies doing something but the focus will inevitably shift back to the capital injection
8528078 investors care most about whether theres clarity on a treasury injection or not and under what terms that would happen until that happens we remain in limbo
8528079 these upbeat capital goods numbers amid a downtrodden u s consumer sector indicates how helpful a weak dollar is in the current cycle

8528117 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8528118 and just in case youre wondering president clinton reminded us of what it is when youve got a president who actually puts people first
8528119 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks how insulting how pathetic how desperate
8528120 again and again on the most important national security issues of our time john mccain was wrong and barack obama was proven right

8528136 we have a great six nations tournament then the heineken cup but this gives something extra to generate interest in club rugby

8528162 i saw all of the blood and i told my daughter everything was ok and i laid down and i passed out on the couch
8528163 he turned around and punched me in my face and i went down those steps and i couldnt move

8528170 he was very kind very considerate the kind of person you could easily warm up to
8528171 he said he was teaching me how to be a real indian he thought i was a little urbanized
8528172 he cooked a gourmet meal over a campfire the size of a cowboy hat

8528179 less than five minutes you know the mossad works quickly
8528180 within less than an hour they called and asked how soon i could be in london

8528182 you dont find many opportunities to play someone that you know is you perfectly you the soul the essence we share it me and him i was astonished to realise that but playing him i felt that everything he did was exactly what i would do if i were in his place
8528183 it is something that is connected with childhood with pains that you have in your first years
8528184 iraqi grandmothers are obsessively clean and so i always wanted to wash my hands at kindergarten
8528185 i thought i dont speak the language i dont belong to you and life is a fight a struggle and you have to change the world
8528186 sometimes you realise that the biggest revolutionaries just wanted to change something in their childhood that was painful and saddam was a socialist revolutionary in the beginning he did many great things for his country at first like building a health system education and nationalising oil revenues and then he took the country to war with iran and destroyed everything
8528187 when you hear his name you immediately instinctively connect it with evil a murderer craziness and so on
8528188 if i played him only as that i would just be fulfilling peoples expectations and thats not interesting
8528189 my role was to build tension between the intention of the writers and my own performance
8528190 so as saddam i believe every word i say and i believe every terrible thing i do is for the good of the nation and every mistake i make is because i cant do things in any other way because of who i am thats the duty of any actor playing any role but especially this role where there is so much prejudice

8528197 i wont do roles that are just an arab with nothing interesting about it i also just turned down a big role because the script was anti israeli it was coming from a place of hatred

8528270 we are very pleased to announce we hit 85 per cent as of today in terms of 3g availability across the country
8528271 for the first time we believe that we will be going head to head with telstra
8528272 we have the luxury of putting our network in those places where the population centres are in 2008
8528273 have its 3g network coverage independently audited to back up claims it is in a position to go head to head with telstra
8528274 only 85 of the population with its 3g network showed just how far optus had lets its investment in mobiles slip
8528275 telstra built and switched on the next g network in just ten months providing voice and high speed wireless broadband services to 98 per cent of the population back in october 2006 and we hit 99 per cent population coverage earlier this year
8528276 nearly two years later and the optus 3g coverage footprint is still miniscule in comparison
8528277 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
8528278 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
8528279 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8528280 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8528281 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8528282 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8528283 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8528284 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8528285 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

8528290 we should carry out a study to determine the sports where we have a chance to fight for a medal instead
8528291 right now our policy is to encourage all our national athletes to try and qualify for the games first we should be selective if we do not want to depend on badminton every time
8528292 the pressure is always tremendous each time the badminton players compete at the olympics and as a former athlete i know how it feels
8528293 focusing on specific sports has been the direction taken by our neighbours in recent years and it has certainly paid off
8528294 our neighbours realised a long time ago that we could not compete on an equal footing when it comes to physical sports
8528295 talent scouting is important in this sense if we can identify and groom the candidates in sports like womens weightlifting give them the right coaching i am sure we can also do well maybe not in london in 2012 but in 2016

8528321 during my times of writing i have constant conversations with god much like praying
8528322 a song usually takes over a whole season of my life and stays with me even through the night in this way this record is written out of worship even as the songs dont necessarily lend themselves to corporate worship i pray that people will find this record to be healing and inspiring in this journey we are on

8528325 i am completely overwhelmed and honored to have the presentation of both a platinum and gold record simultaneous to the release of my next album hello love
8528326 i am thankful to share this moment with all the incredible people that have made this a reality this is so much bigger than one person and i am humbled to be a part of it
8528327 ive heard chris say that he feels his calling is to give voice to the worshipping church
8528328 its a calling he remains faithfully committed to in his concerts and on his recordings and its a continual pleasure amp privilege to watch his songs inspire people of all cultures and bring the hope of the gospel to millions of people throughout the world
8528329 this artist needs no introduction you know him and if you are a worship professional in a church where the music is primarily guitar fronted and band driven there is no way around it you need to get this album but you are also a worshiper and we want to suggest this cd to that side of your persona as well hello love will help you celebrate lament cry for redemption and set your eyes on the grandeur of god dont miss this release professionally or personally
8528330 tomlin takes seriously his responsibility to use his musical talent writing songs for the church the songs on hello love are surely applicable for corporate worship but the melodies and message will stay with worshipers long after they have left the building
8528331 hello love tomlins fifth studio lp furthers this impressive discography yet leans away from previous efforts just enough to give us future glimpses of what could be tomin is simply at the top of his game and rides the wave through another album and the inclination toward a heavier sound receives our applause
8528332 with the inception of sixstepsrecords and our initial signing of chris tomlin our desire was to serve him as a friend worship leader artist and a songwriter
8528333 all we need is one big hit and we are in
8528334 in my view the fear card has only one truly compelling target this election mccain

8528339 obviously i want to put my own slant on it and make it unique to me as well im not too sure what were going to do
8528340 im going to have a think about it i think were going to be working with the irish wheelchair association

8528361 id spent 10 years in italy and i learnt a lot there
8528362 im happy that i started my career in that country but it was just getting a little bit stale there
8528363 italy is still an important country to play in but the english premier league had something special that i wanted to be involved in
8528364 id made up my mind to leave italy obviously it wasnt that simple but blackburn made an important offer and im happy to be here
8528365 theres a certain enthusiasm about all the stadiums of england the way that the people enjoy their football
8528366 i think the clubs have invested a lot of money in bringing in the top players and they have improved the football as a consequence
8528367 it is an enthusiastic league to watch the opportunity was there and i thought it would be good to measure myself against such a good league

8528376 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama
8528377 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side

8528379 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged

8528381 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8528382 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8528383 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8528384 weve fallen into this false sense of urgency that they create
8528385 that idea that everything is breaking news and that if youre not
8528386 but nothing theyre saying is of any import because nobody filters it
8528387 its showing an expertise its the whole reason you guys are in the business youre not on anyones team youre on our team and thats whats stopped
8528388 nobody wanted to have a beer with him he would have been a terrible president hes an elitist can he bowl somebody could have bowled him i just find it stunning as to where this election is going to be decided or where we allow it to be decided
8528389 he is passionate about politics and journalism and he really cares
8528390 jons very focused on what he wants the show to be
8528391 usually tries to pick out whats funny about the situation
8528392 then of course when we came out and started marching there were all of these people coming from every corner of the country
8528393 will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood
8528394 live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8528395 gave me a different perspective of the struggle i was in
8528396 it made me realize that i was part of something much bigger than what i thought before
8528397 there was a hole in the bus floor and there was a piece of cardboard on the floor that kept flapping up as we rode
8528398 when he said that someday well all be one it just stuck in my mind
8528399 this is the most important thing that ive done in my entire life
8528400 im on social security but i just thought im going even if it takes me 10 years to pay it back

8528454 john mccain is my friend weve traveled the world together its a friendship that goes beyond politics and the personal courage and heroism demonstrated by john still amazes me
8528455 but i profoundly i profoundly disagree with the direction john wants to take this country from afghanistan to iraq from amtrak to veterans
8528456 with russia challenging the very freedom of a new democratic country of georgia barack and i will end that neglect
8528457 we will hold russia accountable for its actions and we will help georgia rebuild
8528458 after seven years of denial even the bush administration recognizes that we should talk to iran because thats the best way to ensure our security
8528459 again and again john mccain has been wrong and barack obama is right
8528460 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says we cant have no timelines to draw down our troops in iraq or should we listen to barack obama who says shift the responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8528461 barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8528462 clearly the job of the next president is to rebuild the american dream and to restore american leadership in the world
8528463 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8528464 with eyes firmly fixed on the future and in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare together with one voice right here right now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president

8528495 recent activity levels in the housing market have been very subdued

8528499 surely there is no upside from here whatever we will see over the next couple of months would only be downside in fact we been advocating a sell on most of the realty stocks for the last eight nine months especially we have been talking of the ground realities in december when we had seen the prices weakening at the ground levels so we felt that that should be reflected in the stock prices but instead of that most of the stocks were going up on stories that the realty prices are still moving up we feel that we will see some more downside in the realty prices till november december and once that gets reflected in the stock prices a stock like dlf should at least see 30 35 shaved off from here

8528513 in light of the trying times that the airline sector is currently experiencing as a result of the tremendous increase in fuel costs we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year more particularly because it has been demonstrated that our broad based business model is well positioned to overcome these challenges

8528539 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
8528540 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
8528541 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
8528542 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
8528543 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
8528544 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
8528545 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
8528546 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
8528547 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
8528548 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

8528563 on my first record i didnt have a direction i just wanted to make a record
8528564 i feel pass it along is the best body of work ive done this is where i am now and where ive come from
8528565 that proved to be false because it actually gets quite windy up there
8528566 the effect of thousands of climbers boots and decades of wind snow and harsh weather have slowly eroded the ridge its become much narrower
8528567 we do whatever we have to do to help people out
8528568 the snowfield is a place where a casual day hiker can run into trouble
8528569 unfortunately a lot of people go up there for a day hike unprepared for how quickly the weather can change
8528570 the stars were amazing and when the sun came up everything turned pink
8528571 so i have a solution and it will cost not one thin dime
8528572 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured instead the bureau should categorize people according to the likely source of payment should they need care
8528573 so instead of producing worthless statistics that people fling around in vacuous editorials and pointless debates the census bureau should produce meaningful numbers identifying all of the sources of funds people will draw on if they need medical care
8528574 photographing reflections to create a more compelling image is a great approach by using an evenly balanced composition this photographer highlights the fine line between land above and its mirror image below it would have also been fun to focus in on small reflective elements for additional shots such as the boat and its mast or the mountain peeking over the water
8528575 after you meet them you know how much love and care comes out on a plate
8528576 matchmaker liking each other is not enough you have to get along together
8528577 we went to el paso together we found a place where some crazy old woman had 30 000 records stashed in a warehouse so we went and looked through every one of them
8528578 i got those albums on vinyl because it seemed more interesting to me
8528579 its just the original format and it appealed to me because its going out of date and seemed archaic
8528580 the recording is analog to analog on vinyls as opposed to analog to digital transfer which destroys the sound quality
8528581 yeah i think its a deeper richer sound on vinyl
8528582 i think most people who really are into it would know and agree
8528583 its just perseverance and sticking to it because there are lots of places to find records and there is no guarantee that youre ever going to find a good one
8528584 but if you look look look look and never stop youll probably find something
8528585 there are ways to do things that are a little more than luck of the draw but im not about to divulge my secrets
8528586 i was totally surprised it was a really good show
8528587 i was shocked because i go to shows all over the country and it was really really good great crowd i sold a whole bunch of trents stuff i was really pleasantly surprised
8528588 basically its just for that curious person you just never know whos going to come out of the woodwork and become a fan
8528589 ive seen a few people get that little itch they were kind of curious then next thing you know weve created a monster
8528590 i dont know if i could go to a place and not go looking for records i would say until im physically not able to and i dont see that happening
8528591 until im in the dirt when im in the dirt thats when ill be done
8528592 it was crowded a lot of old faces a lot of wrinkles i cant believe how wrinkly some people are its great
8528593 smith is very charismatic and very very energetic he knows how to move and be a frontman
8528594 i was always proud of the fact that gentleman afterdark struck me as a band where someone would go to a nightclub and see us play and then wake up the next day and think did i really see that
8528595 alice and dick had their own idea of what we were supposed to sound like
8528596 we werent happy with how the record sounded but we had a hell of a time hanging out in the studio with alice and dick it was crazy
8528597 ill tell you one thing i was on coke the whole time i was doing those vocals there was so much coke in the studio and yeah i did coke the whole time
8528598 my voice is a lot different than what it sounds like on that record that was just an embarrassment that ive tried to live down ever since
8528599 there was a lot of heartache there was a lot of f heartache in that band
8528600 there were a lot of people who got strung out on drugs and there was a lot of alcohol
8528601 there were all these encouraging things that would happen but nothing happened
8528602 we were picked by people magazines stars of the future next to tom cruise and glenn close was us you obviously know what happened there
8528603 it was how a rock n roll show should be with the crowd packed up to the front of the stage
8528604 a lot of people remembered some of the old songs people were singing the lyrics it made me miss performing i got goose bumps so i mean when i get goose bumps its a good thing
8528605 were going to do a sound check and thats my only rehearsal and then were going to do the show
8528606 i can never remember the words i dont know maybe it will come back but i dont know
8528607 it will be tough its a lot harder now because im sober in gentleman afterdark we were all drug addicts and drunks
8528608 things will fall over there will be lots of energy and things flying around
8528609 oddly we look pretty much the same as we were
8528610 inspiring impressionism the impressionists and the art of the past

8528612 an important part is to just be open to whatever happens
8528613 to me its a lot like working with found art id never be happy with just an ordinary jam session
8528614 it has to have a certain aesthetic standard right away i knew the playing had to be consistently high so the music wouldnt become just a random thing
8528615 but with a jam session you never know when its natural life will end i always feel honored that people still keep showing up
8528616 theres a strong circle of friends who show up every sunday
8528617 it was because of pete and the jam sessions that weve all become such great friends
8528618 among the musicians i always want to be aware of their unofficial rank in the community
8528619 those who have paid their dues always get my respect especially the older players its like a boxer who has been a great boxer it is important for us to honor what they achieved in the past
8528620 the hardest to deal with are the ones who cant play as well as they think they can explaining that to them can be very tough
8528621 but everyone should have a chance to show their strengths
8528622 kosins has a voice that can conjure both the girl next door and her older wiser sister

8528625 risking their lives and sanity in search of cutting edge science
8528626 it was a whole new approach with this record because the songs are shaped more so you have to hear the entire album before making conclusions
8528627 i think america has such bad add these days when it comes to art and entertainment and attention spans have gone down to zero this record was an attempt to give the feeling i had growing up listening to an album until the music rubbed off the disc making an honest connection with it
8528628 m lange of content old and new living and supernatural holy and profane
8528629 we knew we wanted the drums to be a bigger drum sound and a real drum sound
8528630 we wanted the guitars to be bigger than they had in the past
8528631 we knew we had alex skolnick and greg christian on the record and we wanted to do it right
8528632 we went back to our old style of writing when those guys were in the band it has the old feeling and sense of the other albums
8528633 m etal music is the only kind of music that challenges those subjects like good versus evil

8528635 like last year so many people are coming together on a moments notice some who havent talked in years
8528636 and it all stemmed from a conversation between bruce witkin and me its amazing to see how far its come
8528637 what i would love to eventually do is bring in new young local bands every year and really build up the scene
8528638 and to do it in my moms name really means a lot
8528639 omg do you remember how ridiculous we were wtf were we thinking lol look i brought my ipod
8528640 at the convention which sounded to some obama supporters like a call for a co starring role in denver
8528641 i havent spent the past 35 years in the trenches advocating for children campaigning for universal healthcare helping parents balance work and family and fighting for womens rights at home and around the world to see another republican in the white house squander the promise of the country and the hopes of our people

8528645 took a cut from the studio pay of each officer whose off duty work they arranged
8528646 say all the retired guys are out of here tomorrow wed like to establish criteria and see if they meet it phase it in over time and not just kick them out all at once
8528647 wed rather know these officers are under our control and supervision
8528648 the old pro wranglers who have always done a good job
8528649 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8528650 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8528651 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8528652 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8528653 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8528654 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8528655 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8528656 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8528657 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8528658 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country
8528659 were not little kids to be told what to do in a half hour
8528660 upbeat capex readings are unlikely to prevent the rba delivering the much anticipated rate cut next week
8528661 it would take a stick of dynamite to shift market views at the current point the capex data does however fit in with the idea that it will be a reasonably modest and cautious easing cycle
8528662 unsteady on her feet her voice was slurred and her eyes were not focused
8528663 with our eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare with one voice here and now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8528664 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party
8528665 the american dream is under siege at home and americas leadership in the world has been weakened
8528666 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work i have done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8528667 he has a remarkable ability to inspire people to raise our hopes and rally us to high purpose
8528668 he has the intelligence and curiosity every successful president needs
8528669 his policies on the economy on taxes on healthcare on energy are far superior to the republican alternative
8528670 he has shown a clear grasp of foreign policy and national security challenges and a firm commitment to rebuild our badly strained military
8528671 his family heritage and his life experiences have given him a unique capacity to lead our increasingly diverse nation in an evermore interdependent world
8528672 the long hard primary tested and strengthened him and in his first presidential decision the selection of a running mate he hit it out of the park
8528673 with joe bidens experience and wisdom supporting barack obamas proven understanding instincts and insight america will have the national security leadership we need
8528674 and so my fellow democrats i say to you barack obama is ready to lead america and to restore american leadership in the world
8528675 the primary began with an all star line up and came down to two remarkable americans locked in a hard fought contest right to the very end
8528676 that campaign generated so much heat it increased global warming now in the end my candidate didnt win but im really proud of the campaign she ran
8528677 im proud that she never quit on the people she stood up for on the changes she pushed for on the future she wanted for all our children
8528678 last night hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything she can to elect barack obama that makes two of us
8528679 actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8528680 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8528681 a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8528682 with our eyes firmly fixed on the future in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory with faith in our party and our country lets declare with one voice here and now that barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8528683 i move senator barack obama of illinois be selected by the convention by acclamation as the nominee of the democratic party

8528699 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8528700 a leader who can deliver change the change everybody knows we need barack obama will deliver that change
8528701 i believe in rehabilitation and not incarceration but successful rehabilitation needs accountability and so often demands direct intervention in the life of someone who is addicted to drugs
8528702 he is a person who has personally struggled with addiction and its unfortunate
8528703 but last i checked he was an actor not a policy expert and i think that although his personal experiences need to be respected they do not define good policy
8528704 we are cooperating fully we will not tolerate in any leader actions that threaten the best interests of our members
8528705 we take seriously any allegations of intimidation violence or retaliation intimidation of union members is unacceptable and is prohibited by law
8528706 the chthonic divinity was essentially a god of the regions under the earth at first of the dark home of the seed later on of the still darker home of the dead
8528707 the chthonic imagery of norines apartment which was black as a coalhole and heated by the furnace of the hostess unslaked desires
8528708 two great and contrasted forms of ritual the olympian and the chthonic the one a ritual of cheerful character the other a ritual of gloom and fostering superstition
8528709 its something were concerned about obviously because of the fatigue factor and the burnout factor
8528710 overtime is something thats a necessary component in the business of public safety you dont just punch out because youre at 48 hours of overtime
8528711 we would certainly hope that the current sheriffs administration takes a look at the data with an eye toward seeking a resolution as soon as possible
8528712 excessive overtime over the standards can affect job performance and this is an issue of mutual concern to the sheriffs department and to us
8528713 taking away our electronic bingo is like taking away your childs playstation and handing him a piece of paper and a pencil
8528714 the state has already said this kind of gaming is reserved to the tribes
8528715 i should warn you that matters are about to take a turn for the worse at the royal albert hall
8528716 with the redistricting the way it is done republicans can only win primaries if theyre way to the right and democrats can only win if they are way to the left
8528717 they are saying things in here and i never want to repeat it because what we say in this office shouldnt be repeated but its clear that their hearts are sometimes in the right direction but theyre afraid to go back to their districts because theyd get slaughtered
8528718 they could never win anything again their political career is over
8528719 same thing with the democrats they have those kind of fears
8528720 between the redistricting and open primaries it would change the whole situation
8528721 term limits has not worked as far as im concerned at all
8528722 legislators come up to me all the time and say ive only done one budget
8528723 as leader its her first budget i mean poor girl she gets thrown into this it makes it very very difficult when people start from scratch all the time
8528724 the good thing is we do have a lot of smart people in this building its all about the political system

8528729 israel missed a chance to learn from the most influential musicians of the decade and the beatles missed an opportunity to reach out to one of the most passionate audiences in the world
8528730 were not going to turn our backs on our friends because they have become successful
8528731 so for example we wouldnt not play feist because shes had humongous hits because her music is a perfect fit for our show that having been said theres a lot of stuff on our show that otherwise doesnt really get played on the radio at all
8528732 we never want it to seem like we know so much about this great music and here it is to be know y is not our goal we want to share music with people just like a friend who always seems to know everything about music but doesnt do it in a snobby way
8528733 which as ive come to understand is a little unusual
8528734 if nothing is precious enough for us then we are none perfectly none

8528737 the man has been known to travel in and out of iraq to neighboring nations including iran and lebanon where it is believed he meets and helps run the iranian backed special groups in iraq
8528738 given the size of the settlement it plainly falls within the range of settlements that your honour would find fair and reasonable
8528739 i think it makes sense and i cant see any loose ends
8528740 when the true state of the company was revealed to the market its share price collapsed and 2 billion came off its market capitalisation
8528741 it was involved in businesses in south america that werent travelling the way they hoped and instead of revealing the true state of its business to the market it chose to fudge
8528742 if people went into stores only when they needed to buy something and once there they bought only what they needed the economy would collapse
8528743 eine regelrechte sechser schwemme gab es in der zweiten gewinnklasse
8528744 as we look at the results here were the things that stood out for me all the times were closer to one another than the last test true compressor still took the longest but it definitely closed the gap both it and episodes times fell and were more consistent this go around notice neither had an extremely long run as they did before visual hubs time did increase which i expect though not very much
8528745 its sort of a smart thing because i think the clinton delegations are going to leave denver with a high regard for the obama forces
8528746 running as a candidate who happens to be african american not as an african american who happens to be running for president
8528747 no one is going to forget that barack obama is half black
8528748 race is an issue that i believe this nation cannot afford to ignore right now
8528749 there are a lot of white workers and frankly some of them are union members
8528750 race is a tool that is used to divide working people
8528751 shouldnt be about black issues or white issues it should be about issues for every american
8528752 whos most likely to help them with their financial condition if the answer is barack obama nobodys going to care whether hes black green orange purple fuchsia or whatever
8528753 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for sen obama
8528754 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side
8528755 post convention florida should be the poster child for how clinton donors and obamas finance team get along
8528756 indicate that unity is not just a one way street but a two way street and enable certain people that have not yet been able to become involved to become more fully engaged
8528757 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8528758 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8528759 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8528760 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8528761 the victim purposely grabbed the steering wheel and caused the vehicle to hit the curb
8528762 i havent let you down before and i wont let you down now
8528763 just as frank ushered in a golden era i hope this opening will mark the beginning of a resurgence in generation defining live music
8528764 then of course when we came out and started marching there were all of these people coming from every corner of the country
8528765 will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood
8528766 live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8528767 gave me a different perspective of the struggle i was in
8528768 it made me realize that i was part of something much bigger than what i thought before
8528769 there was a hole in the bus floor and there was a piece of cardboard on the floor that kept flapping up as we rode
8528770 when he said that someday well all be one it just stuck in my mind
8528771 this is the most important thing that ive done in my entire life
8528772 im on social security but i just thought im going even if it takes me 10 years to pay it back
8528773 when we leave there we are going to have to keep that energy going weve got to
8528774 i want him to be aware and to be here on this side of heaven and realize a black man being president because he shared with us that he had seen a black man hung
8528775 it has come with a great deal of practice and a great deal of involvement
8528776 he is naturally a very gifted large stage speaker but he has also worked very hard at it
8528777 i would very much urge my side of the aisle as well as the other side of the aisle to provide an affirmative vote
8528778 obama would not be where he is or even close without that 2004 keynote
8528779 words that shook the world 100 years of unforgettable speeches and events
8528780 stepped out of her political role and completely misrepresented the teaching of the catholic church in regard to abortion
8528781 god has given us each of us a free will and a responsibility to answer for our actions
8528782 views of saint augustine who said the law does not provide that the act abortion pertains to homicide for there cannot yet be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation
8528783 direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
8528784 saint augustine wondered about the stages of human development before birth how this related to the question of ensoulment and what it meant for life in the kingdom of god
8528785 quite clear on the immorality of abortion as evil violence destructive of the very fabric of human bonds and society
8528786 its not just a personal opinion that you came up with randomly
8528787 truly grave moral reasons not to advance narrow interests or partisan preferences
8528788 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8528789 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8528790 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8528791 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8528792 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
8528793 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
8528794 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
8528795 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8528796 barack obama er klar til at blive usas pr sident
8528797 i g r aftes fortalte hillary os utvetydigt at hun vil g re alt hvad hun kan for at f barack obama valgt s er vi to af slagsen
8528798 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8528799 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8528800 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8528801 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8528802 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8528803 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8528804 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8528805 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8528806 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8528807 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8528808 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8528809 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8528810 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8528811 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8528812 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8528813 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8528814 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8528815 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8528816 responsibility to protect populations from genocide war crimes ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity
8528817 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8528818 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8528819 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8528820 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8528821 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8528822 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8528823 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8528824 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8528825 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8528826 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8528827 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8528828 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8528829 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8528830 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8528831 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8528832 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8528833 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8528834 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8528835 who are open to doing something on the production side
8528836 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8528837 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8528838 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8528839 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8528840 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8528841 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8528842 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8528843 theyre going to have to give me back my permits
8528844 if he feels i can contribute then i will i know im behind guys like jeff withey chase budinger jordan hill and pretty much all the people already there
8528845 theyre all tremendous players and any way i can help them would be awesome to me all i need is the opportunity if it leads to something from there great
8528846 hes going to have to go there and work hard prove to them hes worth being on scholarship coach olson has said he has a huge upside and its true its hard to find as athletic 6 foot 8 guys like he is
8528847 arizona started talking to me back in january but it was always about a walk on position
8528848 i just always wanted to be offered a scholarship from them my dream was to get a college scholarship
8528849 the tucson community is doing amazing things to help restore their treasure
8528850 its such a neat property they are doing their best to keep up with it but need some overall guidance
8528851 its not the same as it was when george was there
8528852 now it has to be approached differently depending on what they want to do
8528853 shes one of the most creative people ive met in a long time
8528854 the ftcs case is weak and seems a relic of a bygone era when antitrust law was divorced from basic economic principles
8528855 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8528856 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8528857 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8528858 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8528859 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8528860 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8528861 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8528862 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8528863 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8528864 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8528865 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8528866 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8528867 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8528868 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8528869 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8528870 youre constantly in a recruiting mode if this population keeps churning youre constantly training
8528871 youve got to fill the slots but you want quality people who are not going to leave
8528872 you dont want to spend time and resources on someone if theyre just going to up and leave
8528873 the solution is to give the border patrol chief a bit of breathing space to find the right recruits
8528874 in any job or any career the first year or two youre learning whether its for you
8528875 talked very clearly about how john mccain was disconnected from our american people
8528876 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy
8528877 for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8528878 the loss of the middle class in america is something that has been happening for the last seven years and we have to repair
8528879 im greatly concerned that these women dont realize that in campaigns you win some and you lose some
8528880 this should not be an arizona tucson or umc issue im sorry that the federal reimbursement is going to go away
8528881 were never going to turn away somebody who needs care
8528882 the border patrol will never say they are their patients
8528883 if the patients are under arrest the border patrol has to pay for them
8528884 the arizona mexico commission serves as developing linkages and friendships when you need to work on the transfer piece
8528885 we particularly in our hospital here have developed a relationship with hospital general across the border
8528886 i think it would be helpful if there was a methodology and agreement developed between mexico and the united states on how patients would be transferred
8528887 it would be nice to say lets develop a system at this point everyone is doing the best they can
8528888 if only we had held lawmakers responsible back then we would have something other to do on the net than tune to the sports portal sponsored by espn the new o tron cnnbcfox and lol cats central
8528889 the ministers welcomed the conclusion of the negotiations between asean australia and new zealand
8528890 we need to work together again as we did two years ago or the joint venture must find its own solution

8528893 you are ugly you are a psychotic bitch and i hate you i wish i never married you im going to tell all my friends never to get married because the wives always change i mean youre interesting and all but i should have chosen someone who can cook and clean youre worthless youre a fuck up i really think youre demon possesed
8528894 everything will work out okay in the end and you must know that someone loves you somewhere if nobody else your mom and you are good at some things you poor thing its okay its going to be okay in the end

8528963 first of all let me just say that this money exchange is terrible for the people of california
8528964 what we are attempting to do is help leadership lead this is a state with 36 million people and campaigns are not cheap
8528965 makes decisions based on policy not what happens on the political side
8528966 youve got a governor who has raised more special interest contributions than any politician in california history and is holding five and six figure fundraisers across the street from the capitol and hes criticizing people who are trying to thwart his political agenda
8528967 senator perata appears to be surreptiously funneling money through his political committee from ccpoa at a time when the union is trying to get a budget deal to boost pay at taxpayer expense

8528975 we learned the dignity of work and we were told that anyone can make it if they try
8528976 as we gather here tonight our country is less secure and more isolated than at any time in recent history
8528977 the bush mccain foreign policy has dug us into a very deep hole with very few friends to help us climb out
8528978 should we trust john mccains judgment when he says there can be no timelines to draw down our troops from iraq that we must stay indefinitely
8528979 or should we listen to barack obama who says shift responsibility to the iraqis and set a time to bring our combat troops home
8528980 now after six long years the bush administration and the iraqi government are on the verge of setting a date to bring our troops home john mccain was wrong barack obama was right
8528981 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8528982 the whole biden family on this journey with me to take america back
8528983 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8528984 lets declare together with one voice right here right now barack obama is our candidate and he will be our president
8528985 everything i learned in my eight years as president and in the work ive done since
8528986 has convinced me that barack obama is the man for the job
8528987 together we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief
8528988 sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8528999 the reefs of the world are at risk and are especially vulnerable to the rapidly emerging stress brought on by climate change

8529013 our obligation towards peace in somalia is only one aspect there are also requirements of our own including financial requirements
8529014 the operation has been extremely expensive so we will have to balance the domestic pressures on the one hand and pressures in somalia on the other and try to come up with a balanced solution
8529015 we didnt anticipate the international community would be happy riding the ethiopian horse and flogging it at the same time for so long
8529016 we had hoped and expected that the international community would recognise that this was a unique opportunity for the stabilisation of somalia and capitalise on it

8529021 we remain focused on margin improvement with ongoing cost reduction initiatives expected to mitigate the impact of raw material and energy cost increases
8529022 we are alert to the possibility of a further deterioration in economic conditions and whilst we may continue to experience some pockets of weakness we anticipate another period of solid progress in the remainder of the year
8529023 with a strong balance sheet and the trading performance to date the board continues to view the prospects for 2008 with confidence
8529024 we achieved these results despite a trading environment that is becoming tougher with signs of slowing demand particularly in spain the u s and the uk
8529025 nonetheless we remain confident of delivering a result for the year at the upper end of market expectations
8529026 the future is now when it comes to reducing fuel and being a good corporate citizen
8529027 we expect to save up to 35 percent in our fuel bill with these trucks and down the road that can make quite an impact as we typically buy more than 310 000 gallons per year for our delivery trucks
8529028 we look at the hybrids as a way to be good corporate stewards in the reduction of fuel consumption and emissions while doing our part for the environment
8529029 obviously the cost of a hybrid is more than a standard truck but the payback is there when you consider the cost of fuel and the government tax credits the key is putting the trucks to work in the right application where they can optimize their fuel saving capability weve identified stop and go routes where theyre ideally suited
8529030 they know these trucks and the technology and are equipped to make sure everything is running properly
8529031 plus they have safeguards in place with substitute vehicles should we need them paclease takes the worry out of moving toward the hybrids and we feel confident our level of service to our customers will continue to be outstanding with on time deliveries
8529032 it is now clear that we will require further fundamental changes in our operating cost base in order to minimise losses in 2009 and to help ensure the long term viability of the business

8529074 the declaration of independence one of our most honored documents was largely a set of negative appeals
8529075 about 70 percent of the statements in that famed document were criticisms of the british government
8529076 certainly outstrips modern presidential campaigns in the sheer frequency of attack
8529077 we are breeding a culture in which we are too sensitive to negative words about anybody else
8529078 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
8529079 if you tell me ive got to take away this protection for these kids in order to win the election some things arent worth it
8529080 would i make a blanket commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of these countries within the first year i was elected president absolutely positively no

8529086 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8529087 george bush has put the middle class in a hole
8529088 and john mccain has a plan to keep digging that hole with george bushs shovel
8529089 mr president we will be forever in your debt you would think the one thing president bush was good at was inheriting things
8529090 calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush 90 percent of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8529091 came into office on third base and then he stole second
8529092 and john mccain cheered him every step of the way
8529093 i think america is sick and tired of everybody being negative
8529094 you cant expect change from a senator who voted in lockstep with president bush 95 percent of the time
8529095 it makes sense that george bush and john mccain will be together next week in the twin cities
8529096 human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception
8529097 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

8529107 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy
8529108 for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8529109 the loss of the middle class in america is something that has been happening for the last seven years and we have to repair

8529111 the most logical and critical action to address the impacts of ocean acidification on coral reefs is to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration

8529117 when i first joined saracens in 1998 i probably would have thought 30 was my limit
8529118 but then when you get to 30 and you still feel good you think ive got a few more years left
8529119 you cant plan too far ahead because you dont know what is around the corner
8529120 but i have managed to stay relatively injury free in my career so ive had a fair bit of good luck which has helped
8529121 i am still enjoying it and the coaches weve got at bath are constantly opening your eyes to different aspects of the game that you want to move on with
8529122 i am probably not the quickest guy in the squad that has been proved in pre season training but i still feel there are lots of aspects to my game i can work on and improve
8529123 as long as i am fit and i still feel i am improving then i will keep playing the enjoyment aspect of it all is massive
8529124 it was a very sad day to see steve go
8529125 he was a great player for bath and a great guy to play alongside and i am sure i will now have some good battles playing against him
8529126 the loss of steve was unfortunate but signing guys like stuart hooper and justin harrison plus peter short already being here and some young guys coming through i dont see there being any kind of weakness
8529127 for the guys leaving like olly and steve we wanted them to leave the club with a trophy and for the guys who retired it is nice to think their last game was a final that we won
8529128 it was a pleasing day we were due a good day and it came for us
8529129 it was also a very emotional day for a lot of guys but it was nice to finish on a high which hadnt happened for a while
8529130 for the players losing is tough hopefully the guys learnt a lot from the tough seasons we did have
8529131 equally when things are going well everyone feels fresher and a bit keener when you see the guys scoring tries it is quite a bug everyone wants
8529132 it certainly keeps me going having a successful season last season was very motivating
8529133 the premiership is a fantastic competition that just gets better and better and being back in the heineken cup this season is huge for us
8529134 as for the law variations i think we will be ready for them
8529135 is a disgrace to all the fijian players who have made their mark in the elite french competition
8529136 we are disappointed and at the same time embarrassed with his attitude
8529137 its very unprofessional for a player whom the french rugby fans regard as one of the best in the game
8529138 the club booked his flight but he said he did not have enough money i personally sent him money but instead he stayed back in labasa and refused to come over

8529142 we are not just a group of players but a group of friends
8529143 we have only been together for a month but we are getting along very well whether they are australians or new zealanders
8529144 in the second half it really came together and it paid off
8529145 but we mustnt get too excited we must keep our feet on the ground stick to our gameplan continue doing what tana is teaching us and it will all go okay
8529146 we showed our place in the top 14 is justified
8529147 we are going to try to keep the same desire we had during that second half
8529148 we only played for one half thats all i can say things will have to be said
8529149 we had to deal with a revitalised toulon who put together some counter attacking moves and made the most of our errors to score their points
8529150 its kind of been a wash for me an emptiness little bit of an empty hole something missing yeah
8529151 camp was her most favorite thing in the world and when camp came along this year it was hard for me to know it was going on and she wasnt there
8529152 i didnt know what what it would feel like to come to camp part of me dreaded it because i know every activity that would remind me of jez and i knew that it was going to be sad but at the same time just getting to see everybody new that gets to enjoy the activities for the first time that really helps
8529153 we were part of their family almost and that was kind of nice to have
8529154 im just sad that they werent able to find a cure in time to help her but theres hope out there for the other people with diseases to some day be cured
8529155 nous communiquerons si il y a quelque chose de neuf
8529156 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8529157 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
8529158 my heart is very sore this is not nice for us ben was very upset and emotional when we had to say goodbye
8529159 this will pave the way for other parents who want to remove a child from the country to obtain an order purely on the papers before court
8529160 but we would have preferred that oral evidence was led in this matter so that the court could have had a clearer picture a better understanding of the versions of both sides as well as questioned the experts involved
8529161 simply have to bear that it was one of those things
8529162 remaining here with a mother thwarted in satisfying her own needs will bring its own emotional and psychological complications
8529163 in the modern world marked by globalisation and increased mobility when marriages break up one parents interests will invariably have to yield to those of the other
8529164 quite evidently no court can predict the future with certainty yet life in texas for ben and the applicant clearly holds many attractions
8529165 the woman testified she was infuriated with her boyfriend so she unbuttoned the bra she was wearing to choke him as he was lying on the bed in the rented house
8529166 she must have been very strong to kill him that way
8529167 evidence shows that there is a steady increase in the number of thai women being trafficked into south africa especially to pretoria johannesburg and durban
8529168 other alarming increases include the number of men being trafficked to south africa on the pretence of being given work in the construction industry ahead of the 2010 soccer world cup

8529170 nskan om ett visst k n handlar om en l ngtan efter det man inte f tt aldrig om att nska bort det man har
8529171 we were so young our freshman year five out of the six people on the court were freshmen last year we got better and we were almost there we know exactly what we want now and theres no question anymore
8529172 our core group is solid we never really knew how hard it was to make it to the tournament or how great it is to be there we still dont know but we feel like we understand the prestige we want to be there all the other womens teams at a amp m have been performing very well and i feel like weve had the talent now were going to use it
8529173 our whole team is really close even outside of volleyball if were not in the gym were with each other we all spent two weeks in europe together and we still love each other so thats pretty impressive
8529174 basically whoever goes in any night and plays better is going to win its definitely one of the best if not the best conference in the nation
8529175 weve been talking about this and we have a lot of teams we are looking forward to playing
8529176 oklahoma kansas state iowa state missouri and obviously texas and nebraska
8529177 we just feel like a lot of people dont know who we are
8529178 ours are set at the highest they can because nobody wants to underachieve
8529179 weve had some very good practices weve had some that werent so good were making progress
8529180 i think weve made a lot of progress in this camp and hopefully we will continue to make progress in the season we are not a finished product we are a work in progress and will continue to be as we grow this football team
8529181 my whole thing is weve got to get better every day we prepare well and practice well and we take the game and win the game
8529182 we had our first child our daughter rachael and we figured that was going to be too difficult to get everything taken care of
8529183 when texas a amp m opened up it was an opportunity to work together
8529184 he already knows what im gonna say and i know what hes going to say before he says it
8529185 lauries real fiery we go to her for inspiration and passion and john we go to him for skill oriented stuff he runs most of the drills
8529186 john will be angry at me for saying that but its true
8529187 in 1993 we didnt have a venue we trained on the simpson drill field and played our games at a middle school stadium which has since been torn down
8529188 in 1994 we moved to the present site of the aggie soccer stadium but we didnt have lights bench structures or even permanent bleachers
8529189 the a amp m students are the intangible benefit that other schools just cant match
8529190 but its the best because of our student support nobody compares
8529191 when you come to a soccer game in aggieland you see some of the same types of traditions that are evident at other a amp m athletic venues but the students have done a great job of developing some soccer specific traditions and then making sure those evolve into better and better features of the game day experience for everyone
8529192 we go to other places to play and there are only a few hundred people but our games bring in thousands
8529193 i have worked to make phase by phase improvements to the stadium over the years and weve always kept the belief that the fans need to be as close to the action as legally possible
8529194 as demand continues to grow we will look at ways to accommodate more of our fans were always looking for ways to improve
8529195 you gotta manage your time more you really gotta map your day out
8529196 i have study hours practice eat what i can go home its just about time management thats really it
8529197 the greatest rewards are waking up and not seeing your kids all day and coming home and its that smile and that does it for me
8529198 theyre happy to see me thats the biggest joy for me i aint seen them all day and i come home and its like they drawn in to me i cant live without them
8529199 my girls are older so they are more likely to watch tv and dora and hannah montana on the disney channel
8529200 when junior gets old enough me and him will go out into the field and throw the football around and play basketball but the girls theyre like their mama
8529201 now that im a senior im going to try and lead by example and help everyone stay consistent
8529202 i figure a good way to get everyone to do their best is to do my best
8529203 we are a really strong team and we are all very close we expect a lot out of each other and expect a lot out of this season our goal is to end up in the final if we do everything coach says listen to each other and do everything we can to make ourselves better there is no reason we cant do big things this year
8529204 we went to italy and the czech republic where we played teams from italy slovenia and the czech republic european volleyball is so much more different from u s volleyball but we learned how to adjust our game and adapt to new styles in order to win
8529205 we faced the most experienced team that weve ever played
8529206 their players age anywhere from 22 30 so the years that they have put into the game from their training and competition you could really see that their knowledge of the game was very very high
8529207 we got to go to a lot of places like rome and prague
8529208 getting to act like normal people and being with each other in europe just brought us so much closer as a team
8529209 i would say that i see myself as an emotional leader on the team
8529210 im trying to always push the other girls harder and try to get the most out of them
8529211 i know that itd be tough for me to play behind sarah and mary at left side hitter but ill find a role doing something else im willing to do whatever i need to see playing time
8529212 in europe i felt like out team really came together i think we really gelled and grew as a team
8529213 playing some of the best players in the world really helped us we got to see different styles of play and had to make adjustments to that
8529214 weve been putting a lot of work in with all of our practices
8529215 i really think that we have a good shot in the big 12 we have a smaller team but with our ball control and passing i really think that puts ahead of other big 12 teams and i feel well really surprise some people
8529216 i would say i see myself as an emotional leader on the team im trying to always push the other girls harder and try to get the most out of them
8529217 this group collectively has really great impact players and has the potential to be the best weve had here but they also all buy into the team first way we have of doing things here and thats whats important
8529218 im very excited about coming down here its a great town and i love being involved with football schools
8529219 the people here in college station make the transition very easy because everyone has such a positive approach to everything so its been easy for my wife and i to fit in
8529220 i grew up in norman went to school in nebraska and now i am here so i have been fortunate enough to be around some fan bases who love football as much as i do
8529221 we have several people on the staff here that coached me while i was at nebraska
8529222 ive known coach sherman for a few years now so i have a lot of confidence in what we are trying to get done
8529223 intensely loyal fans that have very strong opinions about their sports teams
8529224 are you kidding me do you not see the impact of behavior

8529236 when we leave there we are going to have to keep that energy going weve got to
8529237 i want him to be aware and to be here on this side of heaven and realize a black man being president because he shared with us that he had seen a black man hung
8529238 it has come with a great deal of practice and a great deal of involvement
8529239 he is naturally a very gifted large stage speaker but he has also worked very hard at it

8529340 pur esprimendo apprezzamento e condivisione per la posizione espressa dal sen viespoli rispetto alle considerazioni pronunciate nei giorni scorsi dal sottosegretario bertolaso e dal ministro gelmini sul sud italia deve far rilevare allo stesso che purtroppo queste posizioni sono largamente diffuse nel governo di cui egli fa parte
8529341 purtroppo prosegue nel suo commento il segretario provinciale delludc da parte di molti rappresentanti dellattuale governo nazionale esiste un vero e proprio pregiudizio negativo sul popolo meridionale e sulla classe dirigente espressa da questa parte del paese in questottica continua santamaria al di l delle generiche rassicurazioni fornite da parte di rappresentanti meridionali del governo da guardare con particolare preoccupazione lintroduzione del sistema di federale fiscale e evidente che da parte di alcuni rappresentanti del governo con questo sistema si punta in qualche modo a penalizzare il sud italia la tesi dalla quale si parte sostiene santamaria e che essendo i meridionali per la maggior parte irresponsabili e menefreghisti in questi anni abbiano approfittato del pubblico denaro prelevato per la maggior parte dai contribuenti settentrionali sperperandolo in vari modi
8529342 sono convinto che prosegue santamaria come sostiene viespoli c necessit di avviare una stagione di responsabilit e di rigore e che questa debba essere vissuta con la stessa intensit dal nord al sud del paese in questo senso il sistema di federalismo fiscale potrebbe rappresentare un giusto pungolo per responsabilizzare la classe dirigente territoriale ad evitare sperperi inutili ovviamente tutto ci deve avvenire indistintamente al nord come al sud del paese mi auguro conclude santamaria che i rappresentanti meridionali del governo al momento opportuno sapranno difendere scontrandosi nei fatti se necessario la parte sana e produttiva del nostro territorio evitando che il sud venga ulteriormente penalizzato

8529348 barack una persona come tutte le altre ha ripetuto pi volte michelle nelle interviste pre convention viene dalla classe media e riuscito a fare il college solo grazie alle borse di studio i suoi problemi sono quelli di tutti i genitori americani vuole un avvenire migliore per le nostre figlie
8529349 un uomo integro capace di trascinare lamerica e di restituire speranza
8529350 io e barack siamo stati educati con gli stessi valori ha ricordato che devi lavorare sodo per ottenere ci che vuoi nella vita che la parola data un vincolo che se prometti qualcosa lo dovrai mantenere e che devi trattare ogni persona con dignit e rispetto anche se non sei daccordo con loro
8529351 e rimasto lo stesso uomo di cui mi innamorai 19 anni fa luomo che quando mi ha portato a casa dallospedale insieme alla nostra prima figlia guidava a passo di lumaca guardando con ansia nello specchietto retrovisore sentendo per intero il peso del nostro futuro nelle sue mani e deciso a dare alla nostra bimba tutto ci per cui aveva lottato e quello che lui non aveva mai avuto labbraccio rassicurante di un padre
8529352 e grazie alla forza di volont e alla determinazione di uomini cos ha aggiunto alludendo al padre e al marito che questa settimana possiamo celebrare due anniversari gli 88 anni del diritto di voto alle donne e i 45 del discorso di martin luther king che ci ispir con il suo sogno

8529355 avete partecipato a questa campagna solo per me o per lamerica
8529356 altri quatto anni come gli otto che abbiamo gi passato
8529357 sono molto onorata di essere qui stanotte come madre orgogliosa democratica orgogliosa americana orgogliosa e una orgogliosa sostenitrice di barack obama
8529358 non importa se avete votato per me o per barack ha affermato e giunto adesso il momento di essere uniti come un partito unito con uno scopo preciso siamo tutti nella stessa squadra e nessuno pu permettersi di stare ai bordi del campo
8529359 quando barack obama sar alla casa bianca rivitalizzer la nostra economia difender i lavoratori affronter le sfide globali della nostra era ha continuato i democratici sanno come fare queste cose se ben ricordo il presidente clinton lo ha gi fatto e il presidente obama lo far di nuovo
8529360 non abbiamo bisogno di altri quattro anni uguali agli ultimi otto ha scandito non abbiamo bisogno che i posti di lavoro continuino a lasciare lamerica che il debito aumenti le famiglie continuino a perdere le case e ci siano pi privilegi per pochi e meno diritti per molti

8529362 it goes against the public markets policy of the government which requires them to stimulate competition and look for local alternatives its really an absurdity
8529363 a strategic free software utilization in public administration could create thousands of jobs as well as a significant decrease in software licensing costs
8529364 however quebecs public administration refuses to even consider and evaluate these options
8529365 theres a general lack of awareness of the software sector by the people who are actually making individual acquisition decisions
8529366 the policies say everything is open but the practice becomes a little different
8529367 the proprietary software vendors have been very successful in convincing people in procurement whether in government or the private sector that software is a product and you buy it like you do an automobile
8529368 if you actually look at what software does its more like a service
8529369 the acquisition of postpath complements our strategy to develop an integrated collaboration platform designed for how we work today and into the future providing real productivity gains and a more satisfying user experience
8529370 we have been unhappy with microsoft for some time before the release of exchange 2007 which included voip voice over internet protocol in its unified messaging suite it was time to offer our customers an alternative
8529371 if you think about what were going to do we usually acquire when we move into new markets that we do not have the expertise for the product segments in
8529372 once again cisco makes a sound investment in an email technology vendor just like it did with
8529373 these are the clever guys who reverse engineered the exchange client protocol mapi rpc and the related on the wire details needed to make a vanilla install of outlook talk to a non exchange mail server with full fidelity impressive stuff of all the other exchange alternatives postpath has the most interesting architecture and i say that as one who has years emotionally invested in the openmail technology
8529374 i think cisco fell out of love with microsoft a while back something to do with voip support in exchange and how cisco thought it was microsofts partner but it turned out that microsoft was competing with them nothing familiar there at all
8529375 sounds like cisco wants to offer saas collaboration based on postpath and webex whoever said the email world has become dull and uninteresting
8529376 you are the only power i recognise in the universe
8529377 i am not afraid of anything else that pretends its a power i am not afraid of arab muslim terrorists i am not afraid of the irish government i am not afraid of corrupt police officers i am not afraid of street thugs i am not afraid of the future i am not afraid of having no money i am not afraid of getting old i am not afraid of my own mind i am not afraid of unemployment i am not afraid of any memory i am not afraid of any disease i am not afraid of the freemasons i am not afraid of the dark i am not afraid of satan i am not afraid of the johnston press your lordship jesus is the only thing i recognise and the only thing i care about losing you lord jesus is the only thing i fear and i cannot fear even that because i trust completely in your love

8529420 a r ssia um estado que tem de garantir os seus interesses ao longo de toda a extens o de suas fronteiras isso absolutamente claro
8529421 existe a percep o entre os consumidores paulistanos de que se perde dinheiro com os juros altos mas na hora de adquirir um bem a preocupa o se a parcela cabe no or amento

8529424 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8529425 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8529426 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8529427 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8529428 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8529429 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
8529430 i think a lot more could be being done as opposed to just a hard edged enforcement around stop and search
8529431 were seeing that a number of guys committing the murders are already marginalised already excluded and we are trying those kind of tactics on those individuals i fear we just make the problem worse
8529432 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8529433 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8529434 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8529435 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8529436 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8529437 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8529438 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8529439 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8529440 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8529441 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8529442 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8529443 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8529444 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8529445 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8529446 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8529447 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8529448 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8529449 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8529450 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8529451 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8529452 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
8529453 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
8529454 com os olhos permanentemente fixos no futuro e pela unidade do nosso partido vamos declarar juntos em uma voz que barack obama o candidato e ser nosso presidente

8529456 n o importa o que passamos durante as prim rias agora estamos juntos e apoiamos entusiasticamente a nomea o de obama

8529466 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8529467 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8529468 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8529469 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8529470 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8529471 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8529472 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8529473 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8529474 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
8529475 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8529476 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8529477 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8529478 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8529479 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8529480 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8529481 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8529482 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8529483 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8529484 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8529485 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8529486 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8529487 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8529488 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
8529489 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
8529490 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
8529491 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
8529492 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus

8529502 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8529503 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8529504 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8529505 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8529506 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8529507 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8529508 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8529509 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8529510 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8529511 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8529512 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8529513 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8529514 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8529515 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8529516 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8529517 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8529518 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8529519 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8529520 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8529521 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8529522 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8529523 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8529524 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8529525 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8529526 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8529527 soweit ich es verstehe interpretieren sie die bibel so dass impfen bedeutet an der f higkeit gottes zu zweifeln den menschen zu besch tzen
8529528 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8529529 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8529530 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8529531 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8529532 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8529533 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8529534 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
8529535 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
8529536 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
8529537 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
8529538 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
8529539 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
8529540 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
8529541 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
8529542 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
8529543 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
8529544 no one works for someone we all just work together
8529545 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
8529546 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
8529547 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
8529548 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
8529549 a major requirement of the hana financial group was to select a standards based authentication solution the actividentity mini token was selected as it complies with the oath open standard providing compatibility with third party software and assurance of future proofing as industry requirements move over time
8529550 compliance with the fsa requirement means that we have to invest in the devices upfront we selected the actividentity mini token because it is a standards based solution combining competitive purchase cost no royalty based renewal cycle and longer battery life this provides hana financial group with the strongest return on investment
8529551 we have shown our commitment to our partners and customers by meeting their critical requirements of delivery timeline price competitiveness and product usability as an organisation committed to supporting global industry standards we look forward to helping more organisations meet the fsa requirement in the future
8529552 this will put ricoh equipment in the hands of a very capable sales force

8529562 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history

8529601 pertemuan yang diumumkan oleh perdana menteri datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi 20 julai lepas saya langsung tidak tahu walaupun saya naib presiden pas
8529602 jadi macam mana saya hendak mengatur supaya perjumpaan mereka gagal sedangkan saya tidak diberitahu walaupun saya naib presiden pas
8529603 dalam mesyuarat pun tidak pernah dimaklumkan adanya perjumpaan pemimpin pas dengan pemimpin umno jadi tidak timbul masalah saya hendak ganggu perjumpaan tersebut

8529610 the evolution of the cerebral cortex certainly improved the ability of human beings to create and adapt to function in and with groups communities and culture and to respond to pain associated with social interactions
8529611 however the cerebral cortex may also have had an unintended effect of allowing humans to relive re experience and suffer from social pain
8529612 the data show that early treatment can result in a slowing of clinical progression these data are also consistent with an earlier trial with rasagiline which showed a similar outcome
8529613 this may offer real benefit to patients who are treated promptly after diagnosis
8529614 communal organisations have taken the law into their hands in orissa what is at stake is not only the freedom of conscience of a minority community but indias secular democracy
8529615 the destructive and divisive communal forces have to be stopped we want this message to go across to people that is why we are closing our educational institutions in deep sorrow and anguish we hope parents become aware of the implications of the incidents in orissa
8529616 the central government has failed to check violence in orissa it is only after five days of violence and atrocities on christians that extra forces are being rushed
8529617 shakespeare is all based on beats rhythm and rhyme all things that rappers deal with
8529618 sir ian came to engage with some of the young people they were quite impressed that someone like him took the time it was impressive for them to see him using shakespeare and they tried to see the links between it and what they do that was something that inspired them
8529619 i think schools should be more active in installing recording studios or buying musical instruments so kids can be more hands on
8529620 this is an amazing resource and the facilities are astonishing
8529621 the road near my house was dug up in october last year for some drainage work however after the work was done the road was left as it is causing problems to residents
8529622 to my amazement within nine days of my filing the application the road was repaired perfectly this is the power of rti
8529623 this was the figure up to december 2007 but now with people becoming aware of rti i suppose the number of people using rti must have gone up
8529624 in june this year mcd was constructing a road near my office in the sunder nagri area but the construction agency was not doing it properly i then filed several applications asking about the details of work carried out and for them to let me inspect the road
8529625 they were using bricks while making the road which should not be done
8529626 they kept asking me what i wanted and why i had filed the rti application they even told me that that they would do anything i wanted if i took back my application
8529627 but i just wanted the road to be made properly and i told them that
8529628 within a few days the road was constructed perfectly rti is a great tool and it really helps a common man to take make the government accountable
8529629 this is true because as soon as people file the rti responsibility gets fixed and officers end up doing the job which otherwise they never do
8529630 i thought the next thing to do would be to make a sculpture of the person who s the ideal beauty of the moment but even kate moss doesn
8529631 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware

8529633 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
8529634 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
8529635 we started using virtualization to address power and space issues in our main datacenter we quickly adopted vmware esx as our standard platform for new projects and consolidated existing servers
8529636 it allowed us to continue business as usual and we experienced no delay in completing projects on time today we are way below our power threshold and gained about 50 of our floor space even after we doubled the amount of windows servers
8529637 before going virtual our datacenter power supply was maxed out we couldnt plug in a toaster now with less hardware we have capacity to handle whatever comes our way
8529638 this allowed us to condense many servers is a small amount of space with vmware and ibm bladecenters we were able to consolidate over a 150 servers into one rack
8529639 today we use hp dl580 g5 to handle larger server workloads
8529640 its a trust thing where they trust me to put the ball where im supposed to and i trust them to be where they need to be

8529644 i think the osbournes to a degree tarnished the publics perception of my dad as a bit of a senile funny bumbling guy
8529645 my dads not an idiot hes nothing short of a genius in my opinion
8529646 he does have huge flaws and were trying to really paint an honest picture of that

8529656 children at the centre of the childrens act act 560
8529657 these are all a mouthful of lies from prof atta mills
8529658 included in the many that spent time in exile were the late victor owusu former presidential candidate mr j h mensah dan botwe asamoah boateng nana addo dankwa akufo addo and myself dr authur kennedy
8529659 all these were brave and loyal citizens who risked their lives and liberties for the freedoms we have today that so many in the npp can be counted amongst the ranks of these brave citizens of our land is perhaps testament to our partys commitment to freedom
8529660 furthermore their names on this role are testament not to cowardice as prof mills claims but to bravery indeed to have survived the dictatorship by maintaining silence in the face of the pervasive evil as prof mills and many others did may have been prudent but it was not courageous
8529661 those were the days when lawyers like nana addo dankwa akufo addo and sam okudzeto stood like sentinels in our dark night showing that right will eventually triumph over the evil of the pndc
8529662 maybe if prof mills needs to be reminded of the events of those days he should talk to his mentor former president rawlings if prof mills could not join the many who sacrificed let him not dishonour their service
8529663 the issue of drivers the police and road safety must be carefully balanced in the interest of the public the recent spate of accidents many stemming from driver error and indiscipline is a major concern for all ghanaians including drivers
8529664 where was prof mills concern about arbitrary arrests when people were picked from their homes and either jailed or executed during the pndc era
8529665 when the ndc had a chance to prospect for oil with prof mills at the helm of ghanas economic management team and hon john mahama at his side he chose to focus the gnpc on everything except prospecting for oil he has no credibility on that issue
8529666 finally all these are consistent with the ndcs policy of lying about everything just to get elected we urge the people of ghana to reject them
8529667 we are for free education for the senior high school level and what is the ndc for
8529668 we are for strengthening nhis and extending its benefits to pregnant women and children and what are they for
8529669 we are for bridging the gap between the north and the south and what are they for
8529670 we will foster the environment for entrepreneurs to create the good high paying jobs of tomorrow and what are they for
8529671 we are for doubling the size of the police and improving the quality of their training and what is the ndc for
8529672 ghana is on a promising road and good example of how development assistance has made a change
8529673 and for this mr president we appreciate your leadership you are worthy of our respect
8529674 she comes across as a hands on leader focussed and principled she is the sort of leader the world should have towards globalization
8529675 when i asked them why nobody told me anything but directed me to come out and started demolishing the building after throwing our personal effects out
8529676 they asked me to get out as the men in yellow t shirts went into the house and started bringing our things outside
8529677 i was told by the police and the young men that they were carrying out a court order
8529678 the plaintiff having obtained judgement for recovery of possession of land lying and situated at odukpong ofankor in the awutu efutu senya district specifically obtained in her relief land registry number 3143 1976 and also an order to go into execution granted and dated may 4 2005

8529694 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people
8529695 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
8529696 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly by comparing the genes of this strain with other strains we were able to identify the two calcium taste genes
8529697 it remains to be seen if what we have discovered in micethe existence of two calcium taste genes holds true for humans we know people have the sweettaste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calciumsensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function

8529713 the chance to vote whats in your heart during the roll call vote
8529714 i signed my ballot this morning for senator obama but a lot of other people who are signing their ballots have made a different choice
8529715 we prevailed in a campaign in which the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8529716 because we were on the right side of history and it won t work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8529717 more than a paycheck its dignity its respect its about whether you can look your children in the eye and say were going to be ok

8529720 tvs in keeping with its tradition of breaking new ground in two wheelers is proud to have brought this world class engine technology into india with the ccvti engine this engine has been developed and patented by avl and licensed to tvs in india
8529721 i got to be on the first page of guruji
8529722 the situation in the region should be resolved in dialogue
8529723 re establish with the members of the various communities the peaceful cohabitation and the harmony that has always been the distinctive mark of the indian society
8529724 the state is a mute spectator to the violence that has been unleashed in the christian community
8529725 very seriously and now they are going to pay them back
8529726 this is nothing but pure political hate propaganda against the christians when the root problem is of course caste oppression
8529727 he was doing a good job of propagating the bright points of hinduism and the missionaries were not able to convert the tribal people as effectively as they were doing previously
8529728 the rest of what happened is something the government needs to investigate and tell the people of india
8529729 i would say the violence is seven times worse than in december
8529730 i mean the government is trying its best but its like a mad frenzy they are just destroying everything
8529731 y solamente son dos partidos y en ese entendimiento est muy claro que solamente el pri y el pan pueden presidirla pues son los nicos que tienen m s de 25 por ciento de los votos

8529733 investigations by unama found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 men and 15 women
8529734 this matter is of grave concern to the united nations we have repeatedly made clear that the safety and welfare of civilians must be considered above all else during the planning and conduct of all military operations
8529735 hey shock and awe at what target did to me hear my story

8529740 if this had been easy somebody would have solved it a long time ago
8529741 a search of the address in derbyshire is under way and is expected to take several days
8529742 persistently low fertility and an increasing number of survivors to higher ages
8529743 projections such as these are proof that we are right to be carrying out the biggest shake up to the immigration system for a generation
8529744 centre stage is our new australian style points based system which means only those we need can come here to work or study
8529745 essential we develop a coherent strategy to deal with population growth
8529746 this strategy must bring together policy on issues from the family to border control housing to skills and planning to immigration control
8529747 we not only need to ensure that our population grows at a more sustainable rate but that we also prepare properly for that sustainable rate of growth
8529748 the government have shown that they have no answers to the challenges we face by failing to plan for our increasing population this makes them part of the problem not the solution
8529749 population statistics are predicted by using recent figures so this report will have used the statistics of immigration in the uk in the last few years the level is high so the prediction will be high
8529750 there are signs that immigration in this country is starting to tail off if you were to do this again in 2010 or 2011 i think it would be different
8529751 work study experience at hong kong science park has built up my perspective and preparation for a future career
8529752 i quickly adapted to working with a team of hong kong engineers and believe the internship experience will help me find a career on graduation either in hong kong or back home in beijing
8529753 we are still on track the process has speeded up and governments are very serious about negotiating a result in copenhagen
8529754 accra has laid the foundation of what could serve as a first negotiating text for a copenhagen deal
8529755 countries have made it very clear that issue of forests need to be part of a copenhagen deal
8529756 thats important because emissions from deforestation account for 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions
8529757 parties were deeply committed and submitted proposals for solutions on the issues
8529758 all in all the group has made good progress its important to take this progress forward in pozna when we return to the issue of the ranges of emissions reductions for developed countries under the kyoto protocol
8529759 one of the cdms shortcomings is that it is not leading to enough investments in africa
8529760 there is a real risk of africa becoming the forgotten continent in the context of the fight against climate change unless we manage to design a regime going into the future that take into account in a much more comprehensive way what africas specific needs are not only on adaptation but also on fuelling clean economic growth
8529761 the country must have a government that can function during a time of economic uncertainty
8529762 i think you really have increasingly in parliament two different visions of where we should be leading the country particularly during challenging economic times
8529763 have tabled an economic agenda that stands diametrically opposed to everything this government stands for
8529764 this prime minister is panicking inventing reasons to call an election and break his word

8529785 so i did a little work on gi joe and i have to say it was really refreshing just how cool and unassuming channing was when you work with actors often you come to expect a certain degree of self absorption theyre just a different breed in general partially because they live in very different realities than the rest of the world channing was always cool he seemed like someone who knew he was in a fortunate position he never dragged his feet coming to set he insisted on taking care of himself and usually had a smile on his face ray park was the same way absolutely gifted martial artist and completely humble for the sake of these two guys i hope the movie does really well as we need more personalities like theirs in the a list
8529786 well i cant really use myself to sign this document now can so give me a pen if you have one
8529787 hello did i ask you are you my personal walking weighing scale
8529788 because i have no reason to question the validity of the preliminary vote count and i have no wish to impose upon the taxpayers of alachua county the burden and expense of conducting a vote recount please consider this letter to serve as a formal waiver of my legal right to seek this vote recount procedure
8529789 we did have some reports of some confusion as to that sign and i checked all of them out and felt satisfied with the response from the supervisor of elections
8529790 i think there could be some confusion but i hope that the majority of voters were not confused
8529791 this is the first time in history weve had a u s supreme court justice judging it and here we have the chief justice no less
8529792 these guys have a wealth of knowledge about campaigns on the national level
8529793 there will be no significant departures from the track the board has established
8529794 i expect they will continue to put emphasis on providing the maximum resources that are available to ensure our students are successful
8529795 we teachers have a real advocate in eileen roy and i think the community sees it that way too

8529803 could i just mention to you jay a moment of seriousness i spent 51 2 years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair and i didnt spend those 51 2 years because not because i wanted to get a house when i got out
8529804 cindy i refuse to take out the garbage i lived in garbage for 51 2 years
8529805 to those who impugn my honor by pointing out that i now support permanent bush tax cuts for the rich after having voted against them i need only mention that after all the suffering i endured for 51 2 years i have now earned the right to change my mind
8529806 one of the things ive never tried to do is exploit my vietnam service to my country because it would be totally inappropriate to do so
8529807 i think the conventions gone pretty well so far what do you think
8529808 in the spirit of unity with the goal of victory
8529809 a lot of white workers and quite frankly a lot of union members believe hes the wrong race
8529810 everything ive learned in eight years as president and the work ive done since in america and across the globe has convinced me that barack obama is the man for this job
8529811 if im not mistaken hillary clinton rocked the house last night
8529812 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader
8529813 a leader who can deliver change the change that everybody knows we need
8529814 the candidate who once promised a contest of ideas now has nothing left but personal attacks
8529815 no matter where we stood at the beginning of this campaign democrats stand together today
8529816 we believe passionately in barack obamas message of changing the direction of our country

8529830 price point on this is 1299 and this is a dual flash memory camcorder meaning its able to record high definition video on a 32 gigabyte internal flash drive or an sdhc card slot it features a 12 times hd zoom lens all canon optics a 1920 by 1080 full hd cmos sensor and just produces stunning quality video in fact this is the first canon model and really the first industry model to offer 24 megabit per second recording mode which means in the avchd standard youre going to get the highest possible detail and tonal range
8529831 we do have a model called the hg20 which is priced at 949 and that model has a 60 gigabyte hard drive which means youll be able to record up to 22 hours of hd quality video that one does not have a viewfinder

8529838 people are not necessarily upset with county commissioners people may be upset with traffic congestion but it is a question of what the solutions are
8529839 obviously some people arent pleased but is that going to translate into a vote to unseat an incumbent i dont see that happening
8529840 low turnout certainly hurt bryant its the party activists and insiders who tend to turn out to vote and there is still a lot of skepticism toward bryant among some democrats in gainesville
8529841 folks who know byerly in gainesville who are core democratic supporters were not going to be bryant voters in this primary
8529842 this was a democratic primary i think we are going to see a whole different ball game in the general election i think independents and nps no party affiliation are really ticked off
8529843 i think this shows that the democratic party has moved so far left that a moderate pro business democrat cant get elected
8529844 we dont understand the purpose of sleep but it must be important because all animals do it
8529845 the very fact that dolphins have developed the remarkable specialization rather than merely getting rid of sleep altogether should count as evidence that sleep must serve some essential function and cannot be eliminated
8529846 while there may still be no consensus on why animals need to sleep it would seem that searching for a core function of sleep particularly at the cellular level is still a worthwhile exercise

8529864 these are the victims that prosecutors are electing to proceed with at this time
8529865 the defense welcomes this acknowledgment by the prosecution that fully half of the charges involving half of the alleged victims could never be proven
8529866 and by the time the trial has concluded the remaining charges will either be dismissed or anand jon will be found not guilty
8529867 these charges can never be resubmitted during this trial and the defense would strenuously oppose any refiling of these charges in the future after anand jon has been totally acquitted of the remaining charges
8529868 for a chamber of commerce to be ageist or racist or sexist
8529869 i think its time to pass the torch to someone with more expertise in that area

8529872 she said if you dont hear from me something is wrong
8529873 prosecutors have been beating war drums on this murder charge but have brought nothing but unsubstantiated allegations and no charges
8529874 they have not shown us since that mr fayed is involved at all in mrs fayeds death
8529875 she seemed to be doing ok with everything until this last year or so
8529876 we obviously believed that the defendant deserved the death penalty for the tremendous pain and suffering he caused the victims and their families
8529877 itll probably be just as miserable as the one they just wrote
8529878 that this case would go to court we will appeal and we expect to win
8529879 we are coming down on the side of our residents who deserve a good quality of life

8529921 but in terms of the actual points and how big a move i could make i didnt know i didnt really study it that much
8529922 but obviously i love it and im sure theres a few guys that dont love it but its the playoffs its like any sport you play to get there and when you get there its whoever is playing best at that time that comes out on top
