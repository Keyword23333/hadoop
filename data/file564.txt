5640000 mother nature takes care of itself if we humans dont mess it up
5640001 it will close on something like a roll of paper towels and hold it there
5640002 we have a lot of kids in the library and if they stick their hand in just the right place it can get stuck
5640003 but he has to understand where we end up first
5640004 if i had a concern at all it would be hampton road and 88 but thats something we can watch
5640005 weve had our eye on it for a while and we think its a great thing to be taking place here in our area
5640006 we think we are exactly the kind of thing folks attending this event will be looking for
5640007 unlike any other search engine when tineye finds a picture it looks at the pixels in the image using id es identification technology a unique digital fingerprint is made for each image found
5640008 to add stronger and more prominent warnings in the product label about the risk of acute hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis
5640009 this is the kind of side effect that the database is often well suited to pick up
5640010 its the single best medicine we have to treat obese diabetics
5640011 this is something thats come up every nine months to a year
5640012 there would be no way to turn the effects of the drug off which could lead to a substantially worse outcome
5640013 a firearm was recovered and a 38 year old woman was arrested and is being detained at castlblayney garda station under section 30 of the offences against the state act
5640014 in the course of the operation the men threatened gardai with what is believed to have been a firearm and then forced the taxi driver to drive off
5640015 by looking at the big picture and taking the time to identify and monitor marine debris we can gain a better understanding of what makes up ocean based debris develop plans to implement a cleanup program and help create a solution through education and outreach
5640016 marine debris is a hazard to water craft navigation and can pose a threat to life and property when encountered at sea
5640017 in addition protected marine species such as whales dolphins and sea turtles can also interact with fishing gear left behind and other debris which can result in injury or death
5640018 the majority of debris found at beach cleanups in new hampshire comes from ocean based sources so if we can enlist the support and help of the fishermen to help bring in what they find at sea waste management can help them dispose of it properly
5640019 getting the help of local fisherman was not a tough sell
5640020 it really is a benefit to them and their livelihood to do everything they can to diminish marine debris and keep the oceans as clean as possible
5640021 i am very very proud of both of them i am very excited but i was very nervous
5640022 the seafood festival is happening and applecrest orchards gets up and running that weekend but it the jumper classic should be a benefit to our local economy
5640023 while we were there at myopia the caliber and level of the sport rose
5640024 this is a riders horse show so we take athletes considerations like the training surface seriously
5640025 this is not a way to treat a citizen of the town
5640026 8 000 did not come close to covering the cost of that hydrant not even close
5640027 the big thing for me was just getting these hydrants approved so that we can still build houses
5640028 im not aware of any capital funds in the town budget so i can only presume to say that
5640029 we cant commit to giving you 8 000 we dont know anything about
5640030 hed be dealing with the chief and the selectmen with that
5640031 part of my frustration is trying to get a hold of the fire chief and getting no response
5640032 it gets frustrating for me as a citizen and as a developer in this case
5640033 id say its a less than 50 50 chance that i ever get the money
5640034 convert all video files to 3gp mp4 psp ipod swf flv dvd vcd
5640035 up until now it has been massa and hamilton who have the edge because raikkonens performance has been going up and down all the time
5640036 it is very difficult to say who is the best driver in 2008 as the driver is always connected to his cars performance you have to look at the two combined for me in budapest it was certainly massa but two races before that it was hamilton

5640049 wenn die atomlobby in diesem land den fundamentalkonflikt um die atomenergie im vollen bewusstsein um die m glichen katastrophalen folgen und die ungel ste endlagerung des strahlenm lls noch einmal f hren will dann soll sie ihren willen haben
5640050 alt und jung m ssen die anti akw sonne zur ck ins ged chtnis rufen und millionenfach einsetzen gegen diejenigen die tschernobyl harrisburg forsmark brunsb ttel und kr mmel vergessen machen wollen
5640051 beide seiten werden ihren teil dazu beitragen dass der inhalt dieser vereinbarung dauerhaft umgesetzt
5640052 was wir heute erleben ist der hemmungslose wortbruch von spitzenmanagern die gleichzeitig gern als ehrenwerte kaufleute gelten wollen
5640053 nach dieser erfahrung ist es ein st ck aus dem tollhaus dass sich jetzt f hrende parteipolitiker aus union und fdp mit vagen m ndlichen andeutungen eben dieser konzerne ber die preis d mpfende wirkung einer laufzeitverl ngerung oder die reinvestition der milliardengewinne in erneuerbare energien zufriedengeben wollen
5640054 shirts und andere utensilien sind daf r gerade im alltag wunderbare ankn pfungspunkte vor allem wenn sie generationen bergreifend absatz finden
5640055 wer die atomkraft nicht mehr will sollte sein gutes geld nicht ausgerechnet denen berlassen die weiter darauf setzen um ihre markdominanz absichern
5640056 ich habe damit wirklich kein problem sondern freue mich sogar darauf
5640057 ich denke dass es eine ganz tolle stimmung gibt die spanier sind sowieso hei bl tig da wird sicher jede menge los sein wenn wir am samstag um 16 00 uhr starten
5640058 ich pers nlich kenne zwar den kurs schon werde ihn aber erst am freitag beim training erstmals im renntempo befahren er ist sehr untypisch f r einen stadtkurs da es ziemlich schnell zur sache geht nicht so wie in monte carlo wo man sozusagen an den leitplanken klebt aber das kommt mir nur zugute denn bekanntlich liebe ich es schnell
5640059 je mehr wir uns dem finale n hern desto nerv ser werden so manche piloten die noch keine z hlbaren erfolge aufzuweisen haben
5640060 jeder versucht sich m glichst vorteilhaft f r die verhandlungen f r das n chste jahr zu pr sentieren au erdem geht es ja auch um den einen oder anderen platz als testfahrer in der formel 1 da h ren dann pl tzlich alle freundschaften auf
5640061 ich werde nat rlich alles daran setzten dass ich in der gesamtwertung aufs podest springe das l sst sich schlussendlich nicht so schlecht verkaufen

5640063 die finanzmarktexperten haben sich von der negativen zuwachsrate im zweiten quartal zu recht nicht sonderlich beeindrucken lassen
5640064 insgesamt gehen sie von einer zwar schw cheren aber alles in allem robusten konjunkturentwicklung aus und bef rchten naheliegenderweise keine rezession
5640065 das ganze relativiert sich aber da der indikator im vormonat ja sein allzeittief erreicht hat der indikator ist im grund nicht mehr als eine momentaufnahme der stimmung an den m rkten und die ist nur ein bisschen weniger frostig die zahlen sind nicht dazu geeignet f r eine entwarnung bei den rezessionsbef rchtungen zu sorgen sie best tigen eher das bild einer sich eintr benden volkswirtschaft
5640066 i was very proud i felt very honored its amazing to be the first to be given an award especially created for fashion especially by the latin community
5640067 theres no star that ive dressed that i havent enjoyed dressing ive dressed so many beautiful women ive been so lucky to work with all the beautiful women

5640070 international companies have a portfolio of assets in areas of significant decline and no frontier discoveries to make up for that
5640071 there is still a lot of oil to develop out there which is why we dont call this geological peak oil especially in places like venezuela russia iran and iraq
5640072 it was sort of a momentum shift what can you do thats the ballgame
5640073 a nice easy swing on it and put it down the right side
5640074 we made it far but we still had a lot of fun
5640075 we didnt take it too seriously so thats why we did so well we were so happy to be there and figured we would do the best we could
5640076 but judith trotzky greenland had an outstanding tournament she did not lose one game in the district tournament
5640077 we have a really strong deep team and we are all very excited at the same time we dont know what to expect because no one from wentworth has ever gone this far we are hoping to at least win one match
5640078 but we are just trying to take it one step at a time we are just happy to be at sectionals
5640079 we really have nothing to lose so we are just going to do the best we can
5640080 the goal is to keep the flavor of the original barn

5640087 this request for additional information from the doj is a normal and expected part of the regulatory process
5640088 inbev remains confident that the transaction will receive regulatory approval and continues to expect to close the transaction by the end of this year
5640089 more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over

5640092 were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks

5640122 over the long run fuel prices do have an effect a longer term process of adaption is set off
5640123 it is possible that the recent oil price increases have set off such a process and that if oil prices remain on an upward trajectory the adaption process may still have a long way to run

5640138 it is extremely frustrating to be closing my mill through lack of logs while truckloads are going past my door
5640139 the mill is the major employer in town and if all of a sudden 19 families are going to be on reduced income then the flow on to the rest of the community will be disastrous

5640249 ich kann nicht besser werden ich habe noch so viele andere dinge die ich in meinem leben machen m chte und deswegen h re ich auf
5640250 there were periods when i wished i was able to tell people about my condition
5640251 but now even at the age of 29 i dont want to go out on the streets without my make up
5640252 there are millions of people who do wear make up each day for different reasons and i am just one of them but i dont feel i could go out without my vitiligo covered up which sounds pretty sad
5640253 but it is just the way it is for me
5640254 wearing no make up for the ads was good i had been in front of strangers without make up for a short time but with the video a much wider range of people have seen it
5640255 of course my family have seen me before without make up as has my boyfriend and some very close friends
5640256 but even people i work with havent so doing the advert was a big deal for me
5640257 as a child of four i have to admit that i was blissfully unaware of any difference between other children and myself
5640258 i never experienced any animosity cruelty or name calling and for that i must be eternally grateful as not everyone is so fortunate
5640259 it is only when you are a teenager and start staying over at other girls houses that it becomes a bit of a pain having to put the make up on and take it off and i did not feel comfortable telling people who were not in my family
5640260 and when you are a teenager it is all about how you look
5640261 the colour match was so perfect that it meant i didnt have to tell anybody unless i wanted to
5640262 however by not being honest with people other than my family i still was not accepting the fact that this was likely to be with me for the rest of my life and i still had never asked myself if this was something i could cope with forever
5640263 teenagers and people in their early 20s are the most susceptible to psychological and emotional trauma experienced at the onset of the condition
5640264 people with vitiligo dont tend to go swimming or wear a summer dress because of the taboos associated with the skin and because of our obsession with a perfect body and especially the skin
5640265 vitiligo is not so much physically handicapping but psychologically handicapping
5640266 the thought of looking like this when im 57 is terrifying
5640267 having seen these images i can honestly say i am never going to use a sunbed again
5640268 you can so easily get brown from a bottle these days there is just no point in ruining your looks and risking skin cancer by using sunbeds
5640269 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed
5640270 while young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks
5640271 sandi thom only used sunbeds three times a week which we would not regard as causing overexposure to uv rays
5640272 sunbed users are very aware of the risks associated with uv overexposure and most have less than 20 sunbed sessions a year
5640273 but it is also the start of another one because theres no way of predicting what will happen to me afterwards
5640274 im hoping it will be sufficient for me to think about working again which at the moment is impossible
5640275 i never know when im going to have another attack it would be great if i could reduce that enough to live a reasonably normal life
5640276 and were just lucky that nature has provided us with these nerves which connect into that system

5640296 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several hi tech products
5640297 we believe these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5640298 is not something we can negotiate bilaterally with the us
5640299 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the it industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers

5640306 it is a wonderful honor to be named johnsons baby mom of the olympic games 0as i look back one of the hardest things i had to do with raising my son and both my two daughters was to trust they would be okay without me always by their side as they grew older

5640308 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5640309 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change we know harry potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
5640310 when jeff robinov explained the rationale behind moving the release date of harry potter and the half blood prince to july 2009 it was immediately apparent that this offered us the potential to reach the widest possible audience i am extremely proud of this latest film and of the work of david yates and our incomparable cast i believe we have developed and pushed the series further still we are all looking forward to sharing it with harry potter fans around the world even if we have to wait just a bit longer

5640335 in 2004 20 million unmarried women did not vote and 15 million of that 20 were unregistered
5640336 in order to participate in democracy by voting you have to be registered
5640337 unmarried women are the largest group of unregistered people in this country and they are 9 percent less likely to register than married women
5640338 weve seen a huge increase in young people registering and participating in elections
5640339 we are going to be educating about what is at stake for young women and abortion rights is a major piece of that from who constitutes the supreme court to what congress is doing and what is on the ballot
5640340 so its a pretty dynamic reason for womens groups to vote and educate their peers about state ballot issues
5640341 we need to draw as many voters so that roe vs wade is not taken from us
5640342 we are planning to do some of the same things from 2006 with the get out her vote campaign
5640343 but in october we are bringing a panel of experts and have them speak out why its important to vote pro choice and how it should always be a choice no exceptions
5640344 be pro whatever it is you believe in and get out and vote
5640345 one of the things we think is cool about the voting vixen is that we were using consumer tactics that are used against us in terms of creating need and desire to purchase things so we tried to use that and harvest that power for good
5640346 after that well be reaching out to the outer boroughs queens and the bronx places that arent that well covered

5640348 grunds tzlich stellt sich die frage ob man tats chlich so viele insekten f r ein gesundes kosystem braucht die antwort die wird gefunden haben macht es deutlich
5640349 zwar m gen die verschiedenen arten einer gruppe in einem kosystem scheinbar dieselbe funktion erf llen tats chlich reagieren sie aber in ihrem verhalten ganz unterschiedlich auf die so vielf ltigen umweltbedingungen
5640350 die nat rlicherweise vorkommende lebensraum heterogenit t ist eine entscheidende voraussetzung daf r dass die biodiversit t an bedeutung gewinnt so ist der komplement re effekt der verschiedenen arten dann am gr ten wenn auch die ressourcen in raum und zeit unterschiedlich verteilt sind
5640351 die wechselwirkungen zwischen artenvielfalt und kosystemaren dienstleistungen sind f r den menschen immer dann am gr ten wenn die ressourcen f r pflanzen und tiere m glichst heterogen verteilt sind
5640352 damit ist dies die erste wissenschaftliche arbeit die die bedeutung der biodiversit t im hinblick auf die umwelt heterogenit t bei ganz unterschiedlichen kosystem prozessen und in nicht experimentellen kosystemen gezeigt hat
5640353 friend described the salon as very chic and said they even sell kai body lotion and perfume the best
5640354 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5640355 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5640356 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
5640357 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
5640358 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont
5640359 the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms the exploitation of one part of society by the other
5640360 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
5640361 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
5640362 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
5640363 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
5640364 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
5640365 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
5640366 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
5640367 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
5640368 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired
5640369 this is a great hidden gem of a club in oakland
5640370 im so glad i found nessa to do my invites i went to several places in san francisco and on line either they were too expensive or not
5640371 oh i need it i cannot live without it soooo adorable get it for me daddy
5640372 you look like you were going to please ask for assistance
5640373 the difference is those guys are born and raised for generations at altitude im a kid from long island and born and raised at sea level
5640374 dammit get up there so i took the pace and i yelled at them come on man youre wasting my time and youre wasting my energy and the second i went all of those guys would go after me and no one would take the pace from me i was crossing my fingers i would get the junk out and settle in there but i knew i was flipping a coin would i feel good when i did it or would i feel like garbage and i felt like garbage
5640375 i dont like being a role model to certain people but i know there are kids who look up to me and there are people who listen what i have to say so if i am going to say something i might as well say something that is constructive to something greater not just for me or for them individually but for us as a whole
5640376 i hate that i didnt collapse on the track in my olympic moment but im there to do what i do whats the point i had a good day in the prelim and i had a bad day in the final the only thing i can really do is push through it and try to be physically prepared im already looking forward to the next race
5640377 i think there are a lot of people who are way more talented than me i have come a lot further than they have because i believed in myself and enjoy what i am doing i really work toward my goal there are things that come up and you have to make a sacrifice and deal with it or give up i make the sacrifice
5640378 i have my own company i started called reckless running it isnt about a brand or a label but its a life style its about how you feel and putting your heart into it you have to run with heart run reckless im not out here to win a gold medal i am out here because of the thrill of it you try to bridge the gap between the spectator and the athlete a lot of people have the ability to go real far but dont have enough structure to believe in themselves
5640379 for me it is self discovery pushing the limits of my personal being thats why i would never take drugs or cheat in any way
5640380 its a saying from john slovakia its about being pure everybody has money and wants people to look up to them but youre goals should be nonmaterial the only thing material you have is time my entire lifestyle is built around something that most people spend their whole life working against for example what do i have to show for my preliminary race nothing but a pat on the back and feeling good about myself
5640381 11 95 for soup and 4 00 for a side of rice plus tax
5640382 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of two million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we
5640383 and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million in debt to them is even crazier that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even
5640384 tuk tuk oh tuk tuk i would like to love you but i really do not i only go to you because youre 4 blocks away from my house and you provide me with late night dining for my restless soul if only your food werent so gentrified and your atmosphere too cold and sometimes too hot
5640385 this is not a site saying america is perfect or that us governments have not done some bad things it is about adding some balance to the anti americanism out there reflected in the poll results
5640386 the united states is neither a perfect nation nor a perfect ally but the world is a much better place for americas involvement in it america in the world will make that case and id urge you all to visit it
5640387 british attitudes towards the united states are governed by ignorance of the facts on key issues such as crime health care and foreign policy according to a new survey
5640388 theres a fascinating and important new survey of interest to all of us who have views on anti americanism its here on a british based website with worldwide importance and it is to be hoped worldwide reach the finding that 31 of brits think americans without health insurance are turned away from emergency treatment near the bottom of the findings is hugely important because we often report and rightly so on the failings of the us system and the sense among many americans that it has to change but when i tell bbc audiences that large numbers of people are uninsured which is true what many brits think is that those people will get no treatment which is of course not true

5640392 i hadnt eaten all day and it was still this bad a lot of servers yet bad service didnt understand the concept of a vegetarian option alienated the vegetarian by bringing out her food by bringing out her food half an hour after everyone elses they didnt know how to split the bill tasteless tofu

5640395 you do what you can in a situation like that
5640396 the teams been building for this for a year a hundred people really working in one direction
5640397 the course was very technical and you had to be careful sapphire didnt touch a fence in the jump off
5640398 from a spectator point of view it will build excitement
5640399 if we seek to understand american foreign policy in terms of a rational engagement with international problems or even as an effective means of projecting power we are looking in the wrong place the governments interests have always been provincial it seeks to appease lobbyists shift public opinion at crucial stages of the political cycle accommodate crazy christian fantasies and pander to television companies run by eccentric billionaires the us does not really have a foreign policy it has a series of domestic policies which it projects beyond its borders that they threaten the world with 57 varieties of destruction is of no concern to the current administration the only question of interest is who gets paid and what the political kickbacks will be

5640457 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5640458 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5640459 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5640460 probably fannie mae and freddie mac despite what u s treasury secretary hank paulson said these giant mortgage guarantee agencies are not going to exist in their present form in a few years
5640461 there was this view early on in the crisis that sovereign wealth funds could save everybody investment banks did something stupid they lost money in the sub prime theyre great buys sovereign wealth funds come in and make a lot of money by buying them
5640462 that view neglects the point that the financial system has become very bloated in size and needed to shrink
5640463 cutting interest rates is going to lead to a lot of inflation in the next few years in the united states
5640464 if a lactating female with a calf goes past and this calf approaches that animal it may accept it but its a very slim chance
5640465 at stake is more than the crisis in the caucasus but also whether russia and the west can share a core base of values to combat terrorism stop proliferation and promote energy security
5640466 the u s encouraged him without really understanding the nature of the person
5640467 e u is very uncomfortable with the fact that they have invested quite a lot in bringing georgia into the e u neighborhood
5640468 russias economic relationship with the west is mostly based on oil and gas but they want to diversify
5640469 we tend to put out this picture of hostage europe but it is not a one way street
5640470 if russia does not get these revenues then it is in trouble
5640471 helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene
5640472 three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests isaf forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests there were no isaf casualties in the attack
5640473 everywhere i go people have told me oh im getting nervous
5640474 they did it to john kerry they did it to gore they tried to do it to clinton they did it to dukakis thats what they do thats their politics they dont know how to govern but they know how to run a negative campaign but im here to tell you in albuquerque that its not going to work this time
5640475 but i have to say its not an example of putting country first when you say george bushs economic policies have shown great progress
5640476 mr mccain let me explain to you the economic disaster is happening right now maybe you havent noticed
5640477 300 billion worth of tax breaks for the same folks whove been getting tax breaks under george bush
5640478 is calling you whiners this guy obviously doesnt pump his own gas he obviously doesnt do his own shopping hes obviously not paying his own bills
5640479 during bill clintons era in the 1990s incomes for the average family went up by 6 000
5640480 during george bushs reign in the white house we have seen the average family income go down by 1 000
5640481 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5640482 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5640483 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5640484 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5640485 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5640486 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5640487 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5640488 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5640489 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5640490 its cheaper to take the bus than to drive behind it
5640491 there are 23 confirmed dead and up to 20 wounded we have found the legs of the suspected suicide bomber
5640492 a shiite salesman was fatally wounded in an attack at a grocery store and was brought to the citys district hospital when there was a blast in the emergency ward
5640493 we started zocdoc to improve the patient healthcare experience because lets be honest it is a pain and frustration that everyone has felt more than once
5640494 the goal is to make patients aware of open appointments for local doctors in real time anytime and book those times 24 7 and even minutes before the appointment our simple solution addresses a very complex problem that until now had not been solved

5640496 guys like me dont deserve girls like you amy you know what mg fake name for him does right me and him are the same type i went to school with him were the same type of people we aint shit amy and you deserve better you can do better than us really we aint shit were worthless were horrible get a guy who works legit whos only dedicated to you and doesnt make you sad
5640497 yet as we know women are very industrious and dynamic in the face of serious odds
5640498 we see this in instances where women defy serious challenges even in difficult circumstances such as in the informal economy working as hawkers in part time jobs in agriculture and in domestic service determined to provide for their families
5640499 clearly because poverty among these women threatens to negate whatever advance we as south africans have made since the onset of democracy in 1994 we need to strengthen our interventions on womens empowerment
5640500 as well as mistakes we ourselves have made during the years of our independence
5640501 a stark example of the latter is that as we grappled with the development challenges in the post colonial years most of us thought wrongly that the african man the liberator will on his own on his terms and at his own pace without the involvement of women also liberate the rest of society from hunger and underdevelopment
5640502 the market is now focusing on how well the coalition government can resolve the remaining issues

5640536 eine ungenierte fahrpreiserh hung im stil eiskalter energiemultis wirkt wie ein punch von klitschko austesten wo die schmerzgrenze ist wichtigstes ziel der bahn kann es nicht sein eine melkmaschine f r fahrg ste zu sein um investoren ein m glichst prickelndes angebot zu bieten kunden w nschen einen komfortablen personentransport zu einem attraktiven preis ob das eine b rsenbahn wirklich bieten kann die zweifel wachsen
5640537 nat rlich sind mehdorns argumente nicht g nzlich von der hand zu weisen die energiepreise und die personalkosten sind gestiegen doch verbuchte er seine rekordgewinne ja gerade trotz dieser mehrkosten statt die chance zu nutzen noch mehr kunden zum umstieg auf die bahn zu ermutigen ordnet der bahnchef alles seinem lebenstraum b rsengang unter ein falsches signal

5640540 die bahn mag aus ihrer sicht gute gr nde daf r haben dass sie ihre kunden erneut zur kasse bittet hohe energiepreise und den h chsten tarifabschluss in der db geschichte doch das ist nur die eine seite der medaille schlie lich hat die deutsche bahn im ersten halbjahr 2008 ein rekordergebnis eingefahren nicht zuletzt deshalb weil sie so viele passagiere wie noch nie in einem halbjahr bef rderte viele menschen sind gerade wegen der hohen benzinpreise vom auto auf die bahn umgestiegen nun werden sie mit einer tariferh hung bestraft wohl auch deshalb weil das unternehmen kurz vor dem lang umstrittenen teil b rsengang steht denn der bahn konzern will seinen k nftigen investoren ein zeichen geben hier l sst sich gutes geld verdienen

5640567 there are a number of trends currently driving the quite astonishing growth we are seeing in this sector the growing importance of the indirect sales model and the increasing importance of solutions and services are both important contributing factors much of the merger and acquisition activity we are seeing in this space is being driven by customer demand for broader more integrated solutions and to expand support coverage

5640573 the ease with which the derdack products can be integrated into existing it systems and the speed of implementation are very important aspects of the projects we undertake in addition the innovation and vision of the derdack team helps us create new opportunities for growing our business which is good news for both ihorizons and derdack

5640647 certainly the requirements on the public companies are greater typically than on private companies you have to give pretty full disclosure but even then in that public environment there is still opportunity for greater transparency
5640648 what we see quite a lot is boilerplate disclosure discussion that doesnt enable you to work out what the company is doing in calculating its profit

5640708 i also think that the creation of gods stemmed from mankind trying to explain the idea of thought they experienced and heard thought even though they made no sound i think that this is the basis of god belief the consciousness of our own thoughts which we have attributed to external supernatural sources when we think it is our brain in action and our individual minds are the expression of our individual brains when ancient peoples had a wise or a bright idea they attributed those thoughts to a power external to themselves why would they do this i suggest they did it because of a lack of knowledge concerning the functions of the brain and how it expressed itself i think therefore i am not i think therefore it is god speaking to me

5640721 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5640722 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5640723 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5640724 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5640725 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5640726 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention

5640831 politically we need to reassert our commitment to its territorial integrity and like the eu last week to immediate international engagement with the long term settlement of the frozen conflicts
5640832 practically we need to confirm the commitment made at the nato summit in april to membership for ukraine and georgia and to follow it up with serious co operation militarily and politically as part of a structured route map to eventual membership
5640833 now were told before its even started that the next gordon brown relaunch will be about fairness
5640834 but this latest desperate relaunch will sink just like the others have because under labour britain has become more unfair
5640835 this autumn we are going to step up the pressure to make sure that gordon browns obsession with his own short term survival does not do long term damage to britain that would not be fair
5640836 the truth is gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair

5640874 you cant win things are going to get worse before they get better who says theyre going to get better
5640875 just thought id share something you guys may or may not find interesting did you know that the bible suggested the 2nd law of thermodynamics in multiple verses thousands of years before carnot or clausius
5640876 in fact evolution can be precisely defined as any change in the frequency of alleles within a gene pool from one generation to the next
5640877 the variations of animals and plants are not the result of evolution but rather of evolution
5640878 fang the problem is that those who use such arguments believe that bacteria do not possess the capability to change their digestive abilities without attributing such a micro level alteration to how bacteria themselves are designed to be able to adapt
5640879 this gross error extends to all forms of animals and plants and this bias too must be set aside
5640880 no that doesnt count because its a big change in a small creature and small creature dont count because i say so
5640881 but if you had known what this means i desire compassion and not sacrifice you would not have condemned the innocent
5640882 okay guys lets pull out the scrolls and do some revisions
5640883 you recognize that there are circumstances when the law is not meant to be binding and doing good on the sabbath is one of them
5640884 if you had known what these words mean i desire mercy not sacrifice you would not have condemned the innocent
5640885 hey thanks for the wow on my site what did you mean by wow sounds like you are a bit of a smart skeptic did you think i did well in the debate
5640886 maragonevolved i didnt chicken out of that debate the problem with you like so many rrs people is that you tend to make up arguments i never made and attack me personally and lie and go off on tangents that arent discussed usually people like you do that because you know youve been cornered and so you have to change the subject or attack me typical frank
5640887 if we are the epitome and center of gods creation then whats the deal with the rest of this stuff its of no use to us it serves no purpose
5640888 second the vast amounts of space might be for us to expand into you correctly say that we dont have the technology to even go to mars but of course that doesnt mean that we never will have the technology to expand to mars and beyond
5640889 third the vastness of space could serve the purpose of allowing the theistically inclined to draw some conclusions about the nature of god if he in fact exists for instance somebody who is inclined to believe in god might look at the vastness and complexity of this universe that goes beyond our understanding and conclude that a correct understanding of god will be one in which god is extremeley powerful perhaps this would eliminate some contenders such as zeus or some gods who are a bit too anthropocentric if god wants us to know and have faith in him then making a large and grand universe would make sense
5640890 fourth the grandeur of our universe is an excellent devotional tool even if no attributes of god can be rationally derived from the universes vastness believers tend to be astonished awed and humbled by pondering the fact that the god who loves them is so great as to be able to create this universe in all its vastness
5640891 first of all youre pre supposing a deity and then making excuses for him her it
5640892 then youre pre supposing that you as a human are more worthy of love and adoration from a pre supposed deity than any other creature
5640893 the universe isnt vast its infinite we would never be able to use more than like 1 of all of it
5640894 this is a god of the gaps argument anything that you dont understand or cannot comprehend you attribute to god
5640895 how could you possibly believe that this vast universe was created just for you
5640896 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy
5640897 and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority
5640898 and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast
5640899 and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast
5640900 and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven
5640901 and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations
5640902 did god exist for an infinite amount of time who created god
5640903 to be able to create something you must exist inside of time the act of creating itself is an act of time something doesnt exist time passes then it does
5640904 so it is an error placing god within time because god exists outside of time
5640905 the act of creating itself is an act of time something doesnt exist time passes then it does
5640906 god is timeless unchanging eternal uncreated he is the unmovable mover the uncaused cause
5640907 if i promised you a chocolate bar after an infinite amount of time would i ever give you the chocolate bar the answer is no because wed never be able to stop and say an infinite amount of time has passed so an infinite amount of time couldnt have happened before us because we never would have reached now since an infinite amount of time did not come before us it had to have started at one point matter and space cannot exist without time so they too were created at a definite point
5640908 whatever did this was incredibly powerful because there is a lot of energy in the universe
5640909 we know it was incredibly intelligent because it created enough stuff to sustain life on earth
5640910 and look at some of those hateful atheists trying to persecute me for being right
5640911 logical tested well supported explanation for a great variety of facts
5640912 modern biology ie medical science is based on and dependent on the theory of evolution
5640913 i hope this was not the blog you said you would be posting in order to respond to my answers to your questions i was under the impression that the promised blog would be telling me how wrong i was but this one has nothing to do with my answers so perhaps that blog is not yet posted i am just going to comment on this point by point
5640914 secondly i just need to verify something do you mean to say that the theory of evolution is true just for the mere fact it is accepted that is not very logical you can not possibly say that it is accepted because it is true because as i have said to you before you can not give evidence that it is true
5640915 which is going to lead to my next point but first lets look at scientific theories that were once widely accepted as true the phlogiston theory stated that there was a fifth element called phlogiston that was contained within combustible bodies accepted for almost 100 years the aristotelian gravitational theory stated that all bodies moved towards their natural place for certain objects aristotle explained that their natural place was perhaps the center of the earth for gases and such he explained that their natural place could be the moon this was accepted from the 4th century bc until the 16th century it is irrelevant how long a theory is accepted people can go on being ignorant as long as they want a theory does not become more true the longer you state that it is
5640916 also back to scientific method for a moment a major part of the scientific method is scientific testing can you tell me how this theory was tested
5640917 i enjoyed your list of things that science has been correct about however once again how completely irrelevant to another theory
5640918 scientific method does not always fail and being able to see that a theory is incorrect does not imply a lack of support for the scientific method i have already gave a couple of examples about things that science has been wrong about and if you would like i could go on as well if you are attempting to be logical and present an acceptable debate do not use a completely extaneous statement as validation
5640919 there s a reason you ve never heard of bus rage
5640920 i saw a man lying on the street half dead he had knives and forks sticking out of his leg he said ahh ahh ahh ahhhhhhhhwww can somebody get the knife and fork out of my leg please
5640921 and when we close our eyes and when another circuit dies a new sensation begins to rise slowly through your body
5640922 now all my friends are late and now i can hardly wait for my ticker tape parade to come rolling by
5640923 the greatest money making secret in the history is giving
5640924 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5640925 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5640926 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5640927 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues
5640928 most anybody when they leave their country their first choice would be to go back home if they could
5640929 if you look at these groups coming here theyre among the most unlikely to go back and those having the most trouble
5640930 because we have the arabic speaking community and new jersey has a lot of diversity we do get them here
5640931 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
5640932 what happened to the girls over at beaver creek sad to say it woke everybody up right its sad to say that it took their deaths to bring our tribe together as one
5640933 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5640934 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5640935 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5640936 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5640937 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5640938 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5640939 i think the youth from 12 to 18 are kind of lost they dont know their place in the tribe
5640940 what happened to the girls over at beaver creek sad to say it woke everybody up right its sad to say that it took their deaths to bring our tribe together as one
5640941 we need more parental supervision we need more guidance we need more activities out there that will keep kids involved
5640942 we need a recreation area around here where kids can play basketball
5640943 kids drop out of school and dont finish their education
5640944 i think my daughter tried a little too hard to try to fit in she was an impressionable age
5640945 that seems to be like a normal thing on the reservation like drugs and alcohol and she was exposed to it more and i dont know that she knew how to handle it
5640946 we have a long waiting list of people waiting to go to treatment
5640947 so we basically have the same life expectancy as somebody in africa

5640951 cyber bullying is not under any definition trespass or theft
5640952 cyber bullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking
5640953 it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area
5640954 as a tool to address all manner of cyber crimes
5640955 moreover the vehicle for the cyber bullying at issue here a social networking web site only became mainstream after 2000

5640959 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the u s

5640961 one gold medal is amazing two is well incredible three practically unbelievable but eight eight gold medals thats thats well well were going to need some new adjectives for whatever that is congratulations michael
5640962 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5640963 its huge its the opportunity that no startup generally gets
5640964 with opportunity obviously theres a lot of responsibility for us to take advantage of it properly and do it in a way that not only benefits the company but also benefits michael
5640965 we are currently evaluating opportunities to build upon this excitement however a final determination about our future plans has not yet been made
5640966 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5640967 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5640968 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home

5640976 o projecto da federa o e a estrutura que t m adoptado tem sido um espect culo t m apostado bastante em captar talentos e cada vez mais nos atletas
5640977 acho que falta atitude falta mesmo terem um pouco a consci ncia do que um evento como estes isto tem de vir mesmo do cora o e n o sinto muita gente a vir para os jogos com isso c dentro v m c e pronto olha est feito aqui tens de competir a fundo mas isso que dif cil
5640978 como n o assumem a responsabilidade deles come am a julgar coisas exteriores a desculpar se ou a criticar algu m ou alguma coisa pat tico a pior coisa que um atleta pode fazer
5640979 quando venho a uma prova sei que venho preparada e o que pode acontecer menos quando h um imprevisto como uma queda ou furo nuns jogos ol mpicos o resultado que se obt m bom ou mau nunca deve ser para julgar algu m nunca devemos ver dentro de n s o que fizemos para ter aquele resultado se foi tudo correcto ou n o a nossa consci ncia que tem de dizer isso e avaliar nos sabermos o que realmente fizemos
5640980 na de gomes continua a ser uma atleta de elei o
5640981 n o encontro justifica o para o que aconteceu a vida e ela vai reagir como reagiu h pouco no campeonato do mundo em que estava quase a atingir o segundo lugar e no ltimo minuto foi ultrapassada por duas advers rias
5640982 they were going so smoothly i thought i might as well salvage and loot the other wrecks as well
5640983 we should split up and look for jenny well find her faster that way

5640985 if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5640986 theres definitely a lack of beautiful women blokes are not as picky you take what you can get
5640987 i do not agree with any political maneuver to postpone this project in order to allow one individual water service
5640988 if your administration wants to pay for any individual customer to have service do it yourself and not through the south anderson water district
5640989 whats important is that the project did get off the ground after a year or two and i understand it did not include the wells property
5640990 this part of anderson and washington counties never got anything from frankfort until he got in
5640991 they were done because those roads and bridge were in terrible shape
5640992 that run along the creek and up a hill are in an extremely bad state of repair
5640993 in many areas the creek has cut into the edge of the road and needs to be moved away from the road to prevent further damage
5640994 requires constant attention due to repair and replacing boards that are broken or simply fall into the stream
5640995 and he commended me for it but we never did this for him
5640996 were a highly democratic county more than 2 to 1 democratic but nighbert always helped us when he could
5640997 ill bring the unit flag down and turn out the last light
5640998 weve closed a chapter in the history of brooks today
5640999 ive been through a brac before and i know how terrifying it can be
5641000 are you going to ask for the money to be repaid
5641001 i talked to gil olivares about it and he told me everything was ok
5641002 we are surprised and disappointed that mr arango has resorted to litigation to address any issues he has with the bgct
5641003 the allegations in mr arangos lawsuit are very general in nature and it is extremely early in the litigation process but we believe this suit is totally without merit and that the bgct has no liability in the matter
5641004 with chip amp pin now fully implemented in ireland and many countries across europe there are fewer places where the fraudsters can use the fake cards
5641005 cardholders should not be concerned as anyone who may suffer a loss due to the fraud will be reimbursed by their bank or card company
5641006 if customers feel concerned that their card has been compromised in any situation they should report their suspicions to their banks
5641007 if you dont take care of your teeth what do you get
5641008 you can lose all your hair and your skin gets all distorted but its more an emotional pain than physical its embarrassing
5641009 i like children and i know a lot of them dont have anyone to help
5641010 if their hair isnt right theyre not gonna feel right
5641011 i figured theyd start going up sooner or later since the gas prices are higher
5641012 the proposed fare increase covers only 31 2 percent of the expected incremental cost of fuel
5641013 he delighted in watching the childrens eyes when a party of men in blue and red uniforms and with swords came marching in
5641014 when we would travel he would stop at every historical marker we saw
5641015 steves 71 could trace his roots to founding families of san antonio
5641016 im pretty much a fan that if youve been trained if you are registered then you ought to be able to carry a weapon
5641017 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorizations of the institution
5641018 i find it really painful when any tree needs to be cut down
5641019 my opinion is that he is dangerous to be around
5641020 to the point the deputy said he was going to go unconscious
5641021 the deputy is pretty beat up in his facial area
5641022 thats a policy decision on the part of that department
5641023 if theres a cage theyre going in the back seat
5641024 the state has an increasingly important role in installation sustainability
5641025 were a property rights state so it is most difficult where property rights are held so near and dear
5641026 its like the eminent domain issue at what point does the public good and the good of the whole community trump property rights and there has got to be due process and valid compensation
5641027 i would give medina comal kendall guadalupe and bexar counties for the purpose of protecting military installations very prescriptive zoning powers
5641028 we ought to file legislation to give the state a pool of money that local communities can draw from
5641029 that should be loans or grants or bonding capability or what
5641030 diese wohl nicht wissen welchen service sie f r bundestagsabgeordnete zu leisten haben
5641031 go back to bed and let the snow collect and you guys can play tomorrow
5641032 not if the snow gets thick and the forecast says it will
5641033 any political transition in pakistan will have no effect on pakistans nuclear assets because it has a very strong custodial control
5641034 the reality is that pakistans government exists on different levels one of the levels it exists and works at is in the control of its nuclear weapons
5641035 where it does not work is in providing effective services jobs education and health that people need
5641036 pakistans nuclear arsenal is in the hands of the army and the army is not changing hands so whatever the situation was before is largely what it will continue to be
5641037 you are right frank dealing with your non stop pestering ad hominem attacks and claims of people ignoring your emails within minutes of posting them may very well have something to do with why only 1 person has ever completed a debate with you it must be everyone else and have nothing to do with you right the way i see it there is only one common thread here if something doesnt go exactly your way you cry and scream and pound your fist on the ground then you find personal information about people pry into their lives and attack their appearance as if though that had something to do with their intellect your mindless followers dont seem to have any issue with supporting your irreverent behavior and still calling themselves christians all of this comes from a guy that post a picture of half of his face wearing chains as if though he were some sort of thug rapper you play the part of the martyr and wonder why so many people have made threats against you do you really not understand how you treat people do you really think you are justified by the christian bible frank personally i never think that violence is a way to solve anything but it would be hard for me to feel that you didnt deserve it if something did happen to you you can only push people so far i have said it before and i will say it again you have a very serious psychological issue and i urge you to seek help for it btw picked up your debate for you since you slinked away from it so skillfully it was for the most part insightful and intelligent its too bad you couldnt have adapted the mentality of a rational adult for a brief period to participate i suppose it only serves your purpose to stay out of as many of these as you can we all know you cant give straight answers to the tough questions at least you have your lackeys to rely on right
5641038 to succeed here you really do have to believe it will happen and really see yourself being able to do it but the reality is theres a lot of great people out there trying to get the same thing and its not likely to happen youre going against the odds to be able to pull it off
5641039 you dont talk about that ahead of time and because of that some athletes who are great at believing dont really have a plan b and they dont have a gracious response to it because its something they havent prepared for
5641040 if i had competed in group a i would have won the gold my competitors were chasing my kilos
5641041 the interesting part is how we deal with these things its going to happen and how do you deal with it the ioc has put down clear rules regarding the medals i think that is a very strong message thats kind of reinforcing what we believe in acting on the best values of sports
5641042 i wanted to start crying it was a huge goal
5641043 both teams were going all out for it this is what we have been training for all year to keep up with any team today
5641044 the girls fought a good fight we knew it was going to be a tough game but our girls came back from 8 5 down at the end of the third quarter that was incredible
5641045 we cannot make any excuses they were a better team today
5641046 the cyclist kind of turned round and shouted sorry sorry i didnt see him but then kind of just rode off as quickly as possible
5641047 i think weve all been worried as newbury residents for quite some time that the pedestrianisation really isnt up to scratch
5641048 this child has suffered a nasty injury but the cyclist only stopped briefly to say sorry

5641128 while china rejoices during the olympics thousands of tibetans suffer inside tibet our motive is to bring the reality and urgency of the crisis to the fore our struggle is that of a nation an entire race that faces the threat of being wiped out even if there is only one tibetan left in the world we will fight for our existence
5641129 it is the responsibility of those in exile who live in a free world to dispute chinas unacceptable despotic rule in tibet i take this opportunity to say that when the united states can come to the aide of countries like georgia and afghanistan against occupation why cant they help six million non violent tibetans who are under the leadership of a nobel peace prize laureate regain our independence

5641154 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative

5641157 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5641158 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war

5641160 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5641161 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5641166 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5641167 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5641168 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5641169 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5641170 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5641171 this village does not have proper roads nor does it have any clean drinking water they drink contaminated water so when the village head called us and said that if the doctors dont come all of us would die we rushed to them immediately

5641189 jeg spekulerede meget p om jeg var dygtig nok der er skarp konkurrence fra store bureauer og jeg vidste ikke om jeg kunne drive en virksomhed jeg var ydmyg og i tvivl for det er jo et stort skridt at tage
5641190 til at starte med handler det meget om vennetjenester og s det gode netv rk jeg pr ver at outsource de ting af virksomhedsdrift som jeg ikke selv har indsigt nok i det giver mig langt bedre mulighed for at koncentrere mig om det jeg er bedst til nemlig kreativiteten

5641201 i had a great experience at nc state and it was a special place for me over the last two and a half years
5641202 it was not so much offensively we were punished last year it was defensively
5641203 after the physical game we had on wednesday night i was worried before the game that we would not be sharp but we made a good start and were always in control only issue was that we could not finish the game off
5641204 west brom defended intelligently and played in a positive way
5641205 you expected them at some stage to crumble but they never did and they kept going until the last second of the game they have fantastic spirit and a positive attitude towards the game they were not dirty they were resilient and well organised
5641206 im not really worried about the lack of goals because i dont feel we were sharp enough to finish off what we created
5641207 i believe when everyone is fit we can create clear cut chances at times against west brom the final ball was not good enough too heavy not timed well enough and i feel we will improve a lot on that
5641208 nasri has shown he is an intelligent player he has good technique and can integrate well with the team

5641230 all of our houses are green energy efficient and weve figured out its going to save our homeowners over 240 000 over the life of their 20 year mortgage on energy costs
5641231 the sentiment of the town at the time was we wanted to invite her here to do a concert
5641232 and then tim sullivan gets on his soapbox and kind of sours it by making statements that she wasnt good enough
5641233 i thought it was an unnecessary slap in the face i didnt like to see bay city painted up as a bunch of prudes
5641234 me and the guys all kind of chipped in and spent some time and made a big brass key and engraved in it something like to madonna the key to bay city the people who care
5641235 it was about 18 inches long and about 6 inches wide and a half inch thick
5641236 and the offer still stands if she can find time in her busy schedule to drop by so i can honor her with what i consider the citys highest honor
5641237 some in bay city still holding out key to madonna
5641238 its going to be just a great beach addition to the park
5641239 the highest and best use of the property is for the public
5641240 we think by acquiring it well be able to help remedy some of that type of thing
5641241 im really a firm believer in that state park there
5641242 he was like will rogers he never met a man he didnt like
5641243 hed say take time to know somebody and like him
5641244 if he didnt have two irons in the fire he thought he was sleeping
5641245 he was very passionate about his business and a great businessman
5641246 i felt a few pokes then i felt him stab me in the throat
5641247 i felt the knife go in and then rip across my throat he was lying on top of me he was trying to get me to bleed out i really thought i was going to die
5641248 it really is a fun place to live and the local people are appreciative of the history we have and the history we have been able to preserve
5641249 it may not be permanent but we just cannot continue to supplement this special service with the current state of things
5641250 everything is just coming at a higher cost and we understand the situation bay metro is in
5641251 we are hopeful and optimistic that we are going to be able to solve this problem
5641252 it is really unfortunate but with the price of gas and with the rough economy especially in michigan the tours are just unaffordable

5641254 holly falasz was bludgeoned and stabbed while her three children lay sleeping in their beds

5641256 i am proud of the detectives of the bay city police department who worked tirelessly on this case
5641257 we start at first presbyterian church on center avenue and theres 2 6 and 10 mile routes around the city

5641266 since our birthdays were only a few days apart we would walk to downtown bay city and purchase birthday gifts for each other at bell book and candle
5641267 we would purchase note cards stationery envelopes and sealing wax and stamps for each other
5641268 i remember her writing me about having the lead in the school play rumpelstiltskin and making the cheerleading squad
5641269 i could kick myself but all of the letters we exchanged i threw them away
5641270 i grew up in the next block on smith street

5641272 ive always wondered how i could get in contact with her
5641273 madonna actually taught me about the birds and the bees
5641274 one of the neighbor boys told us a joke and she said to me afterward did you know what that was about and i said no so i learned about sex from madonna
5641275 i was there playing in the backyard with her uncle

5641280 weve said for years that musharraf is our best bet and my fear is that we are about to discover how true that was

5641283 our ambition is to trigger a real step change in creating higher value in the cornish economy through the erdf convergence programme our investments will create the opportunity for more productive higher value businesses which can offer more quality better paid jobs this new advisory service will particularly focus on those businesses whose activities add value through knowledge and innovation

5641285 the erdf convergence programme is central to plans for the economic development of cornwall and the isles of scilly and the decision to commit 1 5 million of rda funding to this project demonstrates our commitment to creating a vibrant economy in the area
5641286 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5641287 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5641288 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5641289 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is
5641290 if you are muslim you cant buy a flat in mumbai period
5641291 i could not buy a house and so i think indian democracy is faulty
5641292 mizoram needs it more cut aid from bengal and give it to them
5641293 and if no one is listening then it is because they dont want to hear because this is a referendum people dont need anyone to represent them they are representing themselves as somebody who has followed peoples movements and who has been in rallies and at the heart or the edge of things i dont think you can dispute what you see here
5641294 since the 1930s there have been debates and disputes about who has the right to represent the kashmiri people whether it was hari singh or sheikh abdullah or someone else and the debate continues till today whether it is the hurriyat or some other party
5641295 india needs azadi from kashmir as much as kashmir needs azadi from india
5641296 look son apologies to feminists here ill allow you to indulge in your delinquent behaviour in about two years from now when you are sixteen so why dont we make a deal and you have your freedom unquestioned and unfettered two years from now if you just exercise a little more self control now

5641302 jade had some tests recently then she went off to india to appear in the indian big brother
5641303 yesterday we got a call from her consultant to say she had cancer of the cervix and so she has to come back straight away
5641304 we put the consultant in touch with the programme maker in india and because of the circumstances was allowed to speak to her and explain the results of her tests
5641305 the important thing is to get her back as soon as possible and get this treated
5641306 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans
5641307 my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead
5641308 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger with happy memories from this country
5641309 the commitment date we have made to the administration and congress has been march 2015 and that hasnt changed
5641310 without as much information as we have today we were attempting to close the gap between shuttle retirement and the first flight of orion and ares 1 to the absolute minimum and so we were trying to push the project towards a september 2013 date internally
5641311 that was not a commitment in any sense because we knew we had not built into that any contingencies everything would have to go perfect to make that date and would probably have required some additional funding
5641312 now weve changed our planning date from september 2013 date to a september 2014 date
5641313 there has been a lot of piling on but today the people of detroit got to see a judge rule on the facts of the case

5641336 weve already started weve got to take care of what were doing but were interested
5641337 when you look at it theres time but at the same time you dont want to get behind
5641338 at this time of the year if you get five or six games behind especially seven its not like you cant do it but odds are youve got to really play good and the team ahead of you kind of has to fold kind of has to go through a bad streak the thing about it right now id say at 38 games a team that can get a winning streak going or can get hot thats a team that can put a good push on claiming our division weve got to stay with them
5641339 you should let it affect you psychologically in a good way like last year
5641340 having to watch the mets last year we responded and played well hopefully at this point two games behind well do the same we watch what they do they keep on winning we know we have to keep on winning its unfortunate that we put ourselves in this position but thats the position we are in so were forced to see what they do
5641341 at this time of the year when you let it slip behind its harder to gain ground so this time of year yeah you pay more attention when you are behind
5641342 the market you are in always feels like the worst

5641403 we told them they had kept us awake after they won their medals by doing the haka and going on so fair is fair
5641404 we know the team has not started well but there are still people in the team who could do well
5641405 there was a little bit of pressure on me because the team had not won a medal yet
5641406 i decided to use that to turn it into something positive
5641407 to me this means a lot people were still calling us telling they were supporting us and to keep on trying to keep going all out that lifted us people shouldnt give up on us just yet

5641431 anthony wilding a gallant and generous sportsman and a brave gentleman
5641432 the war has exacted an appallingly heavy toll among the best and bravest athletes of the british empire but i believe none who will be more sincerely regretted in this country can be found in that ever increasing roll of honor than the late anthony wilding
5641433 what has traditionally happened in this country is that a change in voting equipment happens once in the lifetime of an election official with some election officials it never happens
5641434 were now upwards of almost 60 percent of the country that in the last eight years have changed their voting equipment

5641442 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
5641443 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5641444 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position

5641450 i once saw a burnt out car at the bottom of a cliff and i just wondered what happened and i wrote a song about it
5641451 i guess i thought society as a whole is bombarded by advertisements and to me thats why the kids are sick again
5641452 they cant express themselves anymore and this is for them

5641457 every day millions of people across the globe suffer from pain it is something that people from any walk of life can experience however inequalities still exist in regards to its recognition and treatment
5641458 we believe that every human being should be entitled to relief from pain and this congress is a key platform to raise awareness of the very real suffering that afflicts so many
5641459 but its also a very real opportunity to focus on the positives and take a look at the groundbreaking work that is taking place to help make a real difference to peoples everyday lives
5641460 to effectively meet the challenges of pain management in the 21st century we need to encourage governments to provide researchers and physicians with the tools to make the treatment and research of pain a key priority across the globe
5641461 by taking a thematic focus we can present in greater depth pain issues that are pertinent to so many people
5641462 in relation to the issue of pain and cancer the focus is often on the initial diagnosis and treatment without looking at the ways in which the incidence of associated pain can be treated
5641463 obviously proper assessment and management by knowledgeable clinicians and access to appropriate treatment are critical
5641464 however in the research field a number of important studies have taken place along with the introduction of new therapies that will ultimately help relieve the pain and suffering of those diagnosed with this devastating disease it is essential that we focus on areas such as these and we must continue to dedicate time and resources as part of our overall treatment of cancer pain
5641465 were way ahead of you were going to do all that and much more

5641603 im disappointed that i lost but from the other hand if i see things around what ive done still coming from states winning two tournaments in a row coming here i didnt have even just one normal day off
5641604 the joy of sharing this victory with somebody else who i like very much who we had a great two weeks with its quite different to anything ive ever gone through i could only maybe compare it a little bit to some incredible davis cup victories ive ever had

5641608 tesco and sainsburys must stop this punishing local pricing and play fair by all consumers
5641609 a tesco customer in banbridge or dungannon is being charged 2 50 more each time they fill their tank than a tesco customer in bangor
5641610 sainsburys do the same charging customers in forestside or lisburn more than customers in coleraine
5641611 the consumer council believes that this practice is blatantly unfair
5641612 we are confident that the local customer is getting a great deal on fuel
5641613 tesco does not operate a national price our clear goal for customers is to endeavour to be competitive on petrol and diesel in the local catchment area for each store
5641614 amphibious tours offer excitement and a genuinely memorable experience but i am focusing also on the quality of the tour the accuracy of the guided commentary which will be conducted by fully trained personnel and the safety and comfort of our passengers

5641619 in a professional kitchen your knife skills your accuracy and timeline in dicing chopping cutting and mincing are very important
5641620 it is a great class to take if you just want to impress your friends with great desserts and sweets or you want to become a pastry chef
5641621 it is just a great class if you have a business that sells wine or if you want your staff to learn more about wine that they are serving

5641643 no olvidemos que el comandante general de la polic a gral miguel gemio es una autoridad nacional y el cnl wilgen obleas es un comandante departamental y fueron agredidos alevosamente
5641644 debo manifestar nuestra profunda preocupaci n por la extra a casualidad de decretar un paro c vico que contiene cinismo violencia provocaci n la misma fecha en que en bolivia hace 37 a os exactamente se inici el golpe militar m s cruento nos referimos al 19 de agosto de 1971 cuando el coronel banzer con organizaciones e instituciones cruce as llev adelante un golpe militar violento

5641655 journalists come up with things maybe a bit of stirring the west ham kind of side
5641656 it was explained to me that because i had been out for four months with injury that the national coach wanted to see me back in action
5641657 the fact that i am in the under 21s will not affect my game and i aim to make sure it will not be long before i am in the senior squad hopefully i will be back with the big boys again very soon

5641668 moeten niet formeel hun onafhankelijkheid uitroepen het enige wat ze in dit stadium moeten doen is de geldstroom naar walloni stoppen en de belgische regering behandelen met de minachting en verachting die ze verdient

5641670 how dreadful are the curses which mohammedanism lays on its votaries besides the fanatical frenzy which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog there is this fearful fatalistic apathy the effects are apparent in many countries improvident habits slovenly systems of agriculture sluggish methods of commerce and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the prophet rule or live a degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement the next of its dignity and sanctity the fact that in mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property either as a child a wife or a concubine must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of islam has ceased to be a great power among men individual moslems may show splendid qualities but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it no stronger retrograde force exists in the world far from being moribund mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith it has already spread throughout central africa raising fearless warriors at every step and were it not that christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science the science against which it had vainly struggled the civilization of modern europe might fall as fell the civilization of ancient rome
5641671 wij hebben het recht niet om mea culpa te blijven slaan voor onze zogezegde onverdraagzaamheid als wij systematisch met onverdraagzaamheid worden geconfronteerd

5641674 de vraag is of de islam wel in overeenstemming te brengen is met de liberale democratie en de vrijheid de verdraagzaamheid de verscheidenheid en het tegensprekelijk debat zonder dewelke geen open samenleving mogelijk is is de zaak rushdie niet het ultieme bewijs van de onmogelijkheid van de islam zich in te passen in onze samenleving toont zij niet aan dat de islam in wezen een intolerante en totalitaire ideologie is die botst met de culturele morele en juridische voorschriften die gelden in een open en democratische samenleving
5641675 ziehier wat ik u vraag te doen geloof niet dat er weerstand moet geboden worden aan de bezetter aanvaard eerder het feit van zijn overwinning en probeer er lessen uit te trekken voor de werkende klassen en voor het socialisme is deze ineenstorting van een vermolmde wereld verre van een ramp te zijn een bevrijding de weg ligt open voor de twee doelstellingen die de verzuchtingen van het volk samenvatten de europese vrede en de sociale rechtvaardigheid

5641679 itll be one of the slowest days of the year and i think it just kind of fed into itself
5641680 the degree and depth of whats happening in the financial industry is beyond anything weve seen in decades and it takes time to get your arms around the severity of whats happening and what the long term and short term ramifications are
5641681 they said it got a little heated and emotional and in the future they will instruct their employees how to act in that situation
5641682 we are very pleased with the open dialogue and we look forward to more open conversation with the group especially about how we can collectively spread a more powerful message
5641683 ask them to explain how theyre going to get oil for the winter
5641684 the new taxiway would be at the north end of the runway and cut across the infield between the existing taxiway and the main runway
5641685 it will allow smaller planes to taxi around larger ones in the event of a delay
5641686 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
5641687 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
5641688 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
5641689 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
5641690 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
5641691 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
5641692 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5641693 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5641694 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5641695 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5641696 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5641697 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
5641698 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
5641699 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5641700 the woman wanted something for her children to hug while she was in treatment where the face is you slide in a picture of the person you want to remember we put mom and dad in there
5641701 the goal is to keep the flavor of the original barn
5641702 were fairly clear that getting off oil right now is a good idea
5641703 if you can ride on a wave on some kind of craft thats surfing
5641704 all these enclaves of support are coming together for one purpose
5641705 to give back to these brave americans its going to be fun thats the essence of surfing

5641710 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5641711 im doing good doing good just wishing i could have been out there last night
5641712 ill try to get treatment this week im feeling better every day
5641713 training camp is very physically demanding theres some things that come up whether it be a foot or an arm
5641714 its just trying to be smart trying to understand its a long season and not going out there and aggravating something
5641715 pirates or patriots the private wars of capt john paul jones and col john langdon
5641716 hes gotten to where directors think of him when theyre reading a script
5641717 its on the ocean just before it becomes canada real down east maine it was the poorest county in the u s when i grew up poor but good people it isnt like there was any crime or anything its just no one had any money
5641718 he asked me one day if you lived in a world where there wasnt any money
5641719 i thought id at least pull in and ask them about it i wasnt planning on auditioning
5641720 they said are you here to audition i said im just here to see whats going on they said do you have an irish accent i said do i need one they said yeah just go down there and audition so i just went down on stage and probably did a horrible lucky charms thing and got the part
5641721 its a smallish community and you meet wonderful people involved with other theaters last year i did seven shows this year theres been six
5641722 the trade off is if you take a theater role you cant audition most contracts are for four to six weeks you may have an audition date you can get to but they may have tentative shoot dates you may not be able to go to so do you take theater and lose a month and a half or not and hope a better paying job comes though print of film you never know
5641723 people go to new york hoping for their break and theyre miserable i would rather live happily get paid what you do here for seven shows than do one in new york for that money and live where you dont love for the rest of the year
5641724 its too tough to do this with any bit of guilt
5641725 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5641726 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5641727 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5641728 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5641729 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination
5641730 if the doctors say he can go he says he can go and manager davey johnson says he can go he can go
5641731 time will tell but hes not a guy you write off
5641732 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5641733 they had guys in 68 that didnt make the team that could whip this team im not taking anything away from these young athletes but i dont think they have anywhere near the depth we had
5641734 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did
5641735 i am surprised we havent won more gold but you know what i hope this sets a trend
5641736 i had a lot of people in my corner encouraging me and looking after me
5641737 its about what people feel they feel nervous they feel uncomfortable
5641738 the people of this state are grossly overtaxed as it is
5641739 this is obviously not to the advantage of the people
5641740 i cant see fitting the middle school program in what the state baseline is without losing some programing
5641741 we must feel confident as a board that the school we are designing will actually fit the program we offer
5641742 i think theres been a number of points of view raised that the cost and the size of the school has to be addressed
5641743 i dont think we could be more specific then weve been already and i suspect if we engage in further discussion we will be more specific
5641744 eminent domain is a very serious issue and i suggest councilors take a long hard look
5641745 because you work so hard all year and you want to move on
5641746 we live by being aggressive and that was the winning run
5641747 he was just outstanding he is a pure hitter he has a batting cage in his backyard and he swings all day
5641748 we needed to ride on his shoulders to get the job done tonight and he did it
5641749 he has a hard fastball and he knows how to use his other pitches
5641750 i usually try to keep my cool and composure on the mound
5641751 i dont think my mind set has changed any since april
5641752 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5641753 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5641754 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5641755 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5641756 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5641757 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5641758 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5641759 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5641760 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight
5641761 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5641762 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5641763 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5641764 energy is no longer affordable and the effect is reaching well into the middle class we need to meet with police chiefs and with mayors to talk about setting up shelters people are coming in every day
5641765 it might be down now but i think well see home heating oil prices reach 4 a gallon and higher
5641766 theres a lot of brain power here there are a broad group of stakeholders represented we can work together to find regional solutions
5641767 people 65 and older make up 20 percent of our households
5641768 they make up 35 percent of our low income and the percentage of their energy burden is high at 13 to 15 percent of their income this year with higher electricity prices we need more liheap low income home energy assistance program funding and we need to increase the eligibility rates
5641769 we need to work against shut off moratoriums to prevent deaths
5641770 we represent low income and middle class folks we look forward to working with this group
5641771 you can only chip away one issue at a time
5641772 theyre seeing increases in the cash needed to buy the fuel
5641773 customers are paying slower the lines of credit are growing from banks the dealers are talking to banks and to their terminal suppliers
5641774 if they say no then well have to re think things
5641775 that is what we are doing now and from here on
5641776 there are a lot of people who are scurrying now
5641777 prohibition from child care services of persons convicted of certain offenses

5641787 having seen these images i can honestly say i am never going to use a sunbed again
5641788 im in a state of shock and the thought of looking like this at 57 is terrifying
5641789 having seen these images i can honestly say i am never going to use a sunbed again
5641790 you can so easily get brown from a bottle these days there is just no point in ruining your looks and risking skin cancer by using sunbeds
5641791 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed
5641792 we want to provide young people with a shocking visual representation of how sunbeds and over exposure to the sun can dramatically affect the way you look further down the line
5641793 while young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks
5641794 it came at 2 02 pm three quarters of an hour into a speech that kept the nation on tenterhooks president musharraf bowed to the inevitable and announced his resignation here at last was the moment the overwhelming majority of the countrys politicians had been hoping for
5641795 most will wonder why it took the president so long some will rue the lost opportunity to impeach him what is incontestable is that the country must move on from this crisis quickly
5641796 the inevitable has happened left with no options president musharraf has stepped down his reign of nearly nine years has ended the nation has heard him speak for the very last time as head of state
5641797 we are very close to deciding to send the prime minister for the closing ceremony of the olympics to be participated by many foreign dignitaries
5641798 the process went smoothly it was mediated by the french ambassador
5641799 we agreed on future exchanges if there are other prisoners

5641812 kalau kenaikan suku bunga hingga di atas 9 sangat berat bagi perbankan dan masyarakat karena jangan sampai pertumbuhan kredit yang mencapai 30 pada semester i 2008 ini gagal karena meningkatnya npl bank
5641813 pertumbuhan kredit semester i 2008 melonjak tinggi karena pertumbuhan di sektor utility dan juga penyerapan kredit infrastruktur yang mulai meningkat
5641814 ldr ini sangat signifikan pertumbuhannya dan masih baik meskipun kenaikan di kredit konsumsi kartu kredit mendominasi karena keuntungannya besar kur juga signifikan karena ada jaminan dari pemerintah yang membuat bank ekspansif ke depan yang perlu diperhatikan adalah sustainibility

5641823 sometimes it is difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5641824 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issues as in the case of senator obama let me say just in case senator obama does decide to return to his original plan of cutting nasa funding i oppose such cuts

5641851 i have long sought to help russia realize its extraordinary potential as a force for progress in the international community and have supported legislative efforts intended to forge a more constructive relationship with the kremlin
5641852 i left the country convinced that russias invasion of georgia may be the one of the most significant event to occur in europe since the end of communism
5641853 the claims of georgian atrocities that provided the pretext for russias invasion are rapidly being disproved by international observers and the continuing presence of russian forces in the country has severe implications for the broader region
5641854 the war that began in georgia is no longer about that country alone it has become a question of whether and how the west will stand up for the rights of free people throughout the region the outcome there will determine whether we realize the grand ambition of a europe that is whole free and at peace

5641866 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5641867 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now

5641874 victoria police proposes snr const moores experience and that of mr vorchheimer and his family be incorporated into training utilised in developing and training its people deputy commissioner simon overland said
5641875 such conduct can only be described as disgraceful and should not be tolerated in our community against anyone mr overland said
5641876 victoria police is of the view that snr const moore made an error of judgment and did not act in a positive manner to intervene at the earliest opportunity
5641877 looking at the bigger picture we believe the outcome supports our endeavours for the betterment of the community mr vorchheimer said
5641878 we want to reverse certain things that are not right in our community

5641883 theres been a suggestion that theyve been in the vicinity on and off for a couple of weeks but certainly no ones been seen sleeping in the bin or actually living in it maitland police inspector trevor shiels said
5641884 when police investigated they found a few bedding items and living items its a bit hard to draw a conclusion

5641889 there were only five biosafety level 4 labs places equipped to study highly lethal agents such as ebola that have no human vaccine or treatment a government accountability office report stated last fall fifteen are in operation or under construction now according to the report there are hundreds more biosafety level 3 labs which handle agents such as bacillus anthracis which does have a human vaccine

5641893 raising these additional funds is a key element of our plan to drastically increase the presence of the company not only in europe but also in north america and asia at the same time it will help us to maintain our technical leadership for global intelligent wan optimization systems and continue to respond to the demands of our managed services provider partners
5641894 i have always had a great deal of respect for people who worked for the cause of peace even though i didnt always understand why they did what they did or how all of their actions were designed to promote peace i also have to confess that at times it seemed futile the concept of civil disobedience was a difficult one for me to wrap my mind around just how did people know which civil structures were worthy of being challenged by disobedience and just what was peace anyway how would we know it when we found it
5641895 im aware that it doesnt work that way for everyone many people find the ideal of peace first and the person of jesus later jews buddhists muslims pagans hindus etc may all find their way to peace without ever finding jesus im glad there is a way in to peace from many directions and im also glad that its a cause that even an atheist can embrace but while i can observe and respect and affirm all of these peaceful paths i can only commit to jesus its a little embarrassing to admit it in an academic setting where ideas rule over experience but there it is
5641896 it captures the problem of idolatry in a nutshell and for me it also captured my difficulty with peace as a cause peace matters to me as a manifestation of the love jesus calls me us to it is a penultimate goal not the ultimate

5641951 we develop with time and connect with the world we dont just learn our own chinese culture we learn cultures from other countries to enrich ourselves and our lives to lead a more colorful and high quality life
5641952 i think that dancing hip hop has made me younger happier and improved my memory
5641953 i only just started coloring it in the past couple of years
5641954 basically what we found is that things are more complicated than previously thought
5641955 our study shows that there is a large genetic component to caste determination but that there is also a very strong environmental component
5641956 flexibility in caste determination is essential as it allows the colony to respond to changes in need or environmental fluctuations
5641957 differences in the nutrition that an individual assimilated during larval growth are strong predictors of caste
5641958 but there are still haves and have nots in the colony those genetic variants who have a reproductive advantage and those that dont
5641959 the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms the exploitation of one part of society by the other
5641960 instead here is a case where processing is positive in terms of enhancing absorption of lycopene
5641961 what we have found is we can take the red tomato molecular form of lycopene and by processing it and heating it in combination with added oil we can change the shape of the molecule so it is configured in this bent form
5641962 some people like to cook tomato sauce for prolonged periods sometimes reheating it day after day because it tastes better on the second and third day they add fat by using oil or meat and thats going to start to induce cis isomers of lycopene if fat is present and the cooking continues
5641963 so its possible people could induce this process and increase lycopene absorption by routine food preparation procedures as well
5641964 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
5641965 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
5641966 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
5641967 currently one in 28 americans age 40 and over suffer from blindness or low vision and this number is estimated to double in the next 15 years
5641968 our discovery of the switching mechanism in the eye has direct relevance with respect to the eventual development of therapies to treat circadian and sleep disorders in the visually impaired

5642059 therefore this is what the lord says about jehoiakim king of judah he will have no one to sit on the throne of david
5642060 he was the son so it was thought of joseph

5642089 the economy is likely to remain sluggish for the time beingbut it will gradually return to a moderate growth path i dontthink theres much difference in view on the economy between theboj and the government
5642090 let me explain about the word sluggish we changed theexpression this time but it doesnt mean the boj saw a big changein our view on the economy
5642091 we discussed things from various points of view but wehavent changed our view on the basic mechanism of the economy
5642092 while we did say that economic growth was sluggish thepossibility of japans economy worsening sharply is slim

5642141 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
5642142 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
5642143 the russians have clearly overreacted but president saakashvili for some reason seems to think he has a hall pass from this administration
5642144 we knew they were going to go crack heads we told them again and again not to do this
5642145 we thought we had an understanding with the russians that any response would be south ossetia focused clearly its not
5642146 i would say that we mostly were focused elsewhere unlike during the cold war when wed see a single soviet armor battalion move so yes the size and scope of the russian move has come as something of a surprise

5642163 many scientific studies have splendidly enriched our knowledge of the age and dimensions of the cosmos the development of life forms and the appearance of man
5642164 unfair that our own ancestral beliefs however picturesque are publically derided when not a word may be said against others
5642165 has long officially accepted the theory of evolution as a valid possible description of how life developed on earth
5642166 if you cant beat em join em and pretend that this justifies your continued existence while clinging to the remnants of your shattered faith
5642167 genesis was written for a simple pastoral people in a pre scientific age
5642168 w ithin that context its poetic account of creation is perfectly acceptable
5642169 it is perfectly possible to say the least that some incomprehensible life force call it what we will has accompanied prompted and guided the development of the universe at the very least science cannot disprove the existence of such a life force
5642170 science can tell us the chemistry but can go no further
5642171 that life arose entirely by chance on this remote planet and has no purpose or meaning
5642172 when evolution is misused to deny gods existence it is inevitably discredited in the eyes of those who see god at work in the world
5642173 the good christian believes that to render a species extinct is to spit in the face of the creator an atheist can have no such rational objection
5642174 in its denial of meaning and its crude determination to see nothing but physical material atheism is as destructive of environmental sanctity as it is of social responsibility
5642175 once sought to understand gods mind now in their pride they attempt to usurp his throne such unworthy human motives discredit their investigations

5642200 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
5642201 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5642202 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position

5642212 an ambitious but misguided attempt to say something important about the prison industrial complex in the vernacular of a sleazy chicks behind bars genre movie
5642213 with its grungy lighting porn quality production values among the shabbiest to hit the big screen in years unconvincing sets and long static takes now i have a fairly high tolerance for inept genre fiction featuring heavy handed political rhetoric because thats generally the sort of thing that flows out of my fingers when im sat at a keyboard
5642214 from its inception it was a flawed vision the flaw however was not the imagining of a it was the insistence that such a community could only exist if we erased and forgot racial difference is formed not by the eradication of difference but by its affirmation by each of us claiming the identities and cultural legacies that shape who we are and how we live in the world
5642215 during the civil rights struggle it was commonly understood that whites seeking to live in an anti racist world measured their progress and their commitment by their interactions with black people how can a white person assume he or she is not racist if that assumption has not been concretely realized in interaction
5642216 we love your work but were going to change everything about it and not pay you a cent for the privilege buh bye
5642217 just talking to people about how the bible can help people
5642218 you know many of the things wrong in the world today are predicted in the bible
5642219 the focus of the terms work is to begin to understand the wonderful answer to this question

5642221 hey that kid his parents are atheists dont let him in
5642222 the suspected family has been in contact with investigators but at this point we cannot offer a definitive identity
5642223 im still sort of practising for the final so im not going to pull up or not remind myself of how hard it is
5642224 im just saying i raced that like a heat not like a final if i raced that like a final i could have probably expected another half second
5642225 maybe thats saying a lot considering the time but thats how i felt
5642226 i came back to priorities and what to think about at the right moment and it seems to be working out better for me
5642227 monday i was doing my best to think about the right things and stay focused on what i had to do but i found it very hard this morning was much more easier and my head was right and i was very very focused
5642228 can i get my ex girlfriend back if she doesnt answer my phone call or reply my text messages
5642229 we would have thought that the neuroinvasive patients would have fared worse over time but their outcomes normalized over a year
5642230 there was relatively little information about what the long term prognosis was for people infected with west nile
5642231 we decided to do a longitudinal study so we can offer patients and their families a better idea of what to expect
5642232 although i am firmly non religious and lack even a christian family background when i stand with the other parents at the carol night held by my childrens school the effect of everyone singing together can lead to a strong emotional response that makes me feel the importance of being part of that community

5642235 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s
5642236 all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the 2 target by the end of 2009
5642237 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5642238 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs
5642239 jado trained on monday hes our captain and were looking forward to him backing up with us for another season

5642241 norways thriving industrial and innovation markets are an exciting prospect for us
5642242 we have a close relationship with manchester business school and we hope to offer its students more research and business development projects like this
5642243 another development for us this year has been the establishment of the data recovery service in manchester this will enhance the forensic services that cy4or can offer clients and in the future will mean that we can target new market sectors and expand the client base
5642244 the new mobile phone laboratory which will facilitate the recovery of information from mobiles has primarily been established to serve our expanded portfolio of northern clients
5642245 our staff are seen as a valuable asset and the training they undertake is vital to the companys success
5642246 the nature of the computer forensics industry means technology advances very quickly and we have in place a structured training policy to ensure staff are fully trained in the latest forensic tools and software sometimes before they even come into general use within the market place
5642247 the difficulty for many trade customers who run restaurants or bars is that many suppliers will only offer them an entire pallet or half pallet of wine which means 600 or 300 bottles and it is far too much for them
5642248 they have nowhere to store it need a fork lift truck to get the stock off the lorry and its too much cash wrapped up in bottles of wine which is a risk for them
5642249 instead we have no minimum order what we do is offer trade customers in manchester as little as a handful of bottles and we will deliver as many times each week as they need that way they can keep stock levels down and manage their costs
5642250 the north west has a great restaurant and bar trade and we have access to some of the very best wineries from the worlds most renowned wine producing regions we also feel that given the current economic climate businesses are tightening their belts when it comes to staff entertainment and wine tastings can offer cost effective corporate entertainment
5642251 my family has been in the wine business for 25 years and i was brought up surrounded by wine which is unusual for a family with indian roots
5642252 we are looking to steadily grow trade sales supplemented by online sales to the public
5642253 the market is evenly divided between those that think we go up and those that think we go lower
5642254 there is strong support for prices to drift lower towards 100 a barrel we are only about 10 a barrel away and i wont be surprised to see 105 a barrel by next month
5642255 the significance of this concept lies in the fact that the massive installed base of solar collector an order of magnitude more productive than traditional solar cells the significantly high surface area can offset the expected lower efficiency compared to traditional solar cells by several orders of magnitude and hence result in significantly lower cost per unit of power produced
5642256 i guess theyre going to hitch their wagon to him and just ride him off into the sunset
5642257 i always knew he was a good athlete but most pitchers lets be honest cant hit he can swing the bat a little bit i just wish i could have hit some home runs in front of him instead of making him run like that
5642258 i was just looking for something out over the plate trying to put a good swing on it put it in play
5642259 he threw me a curveball and i was able to flip it to left
5642260 ive got to tip my cap because it was a slider down and away i looked at the video 100 times and ill probably see it 100 times when im not sleeping tonight he really helped himself out there its frustrating when something like that happens
5642261 it was a little awkward but i was just trying to get in scoring position
5642262 i like to hit but i think since ive been here the more i hit the worse ive been getting
5642263 hes definitely confident in his hitting abilities and for the right reason hes a good hitter

5642267 we love the university weve been blessed and it just seems like an appropriate thing to do
5642268 will be missed so much by his close knit family who loved him so much
5642269 having surfaced there appears to have been problems trying to start the small rib and the father subsequently called for help from a passing charter boat who came to assist
5642270 it is at this point that all parties have lost sight of the young boy
5642271 louis started diving lessons when he was 12 under a brilliant diving instructor gaining open water diving qualifications in june 2006
5642272 he could even handle the boat himself to perfection he also enjoyed fishing and water skiing
5642273 brixham has always been a special place to louis from when he was first born he loved going there at weekends with all his close family around him
5642274 louis was such an adorable precious son who loved life
5642275 whatever else may be thought about hitlers exploits they are among the most remarkable in the whole history of the world
5642276 our season has started now and weve got to get it right ill have had a good look at myself and the players have got to look at themselves
5642277 i told the team in the dressing room on saturday that weve gifted teams eight points already this season at mansfield i had a few choice words with one or two at half time i wanted a reaction and i certainly got that we were by far the better team in the second half
5642278 the first half defensive performance was poor and that angers me even more because weve been working on that perhaps i picked the wrong team to start the game with
5642279 defenders have got to get back to keeping clean sheets and limiting peoples chances otherwise its going to be a tough one
5642280 while these latest figures are worrying they do not confirm a trend all businesses will feel some impact from the worsening position in the wider economy we remain cautiously optimistic that merseyside businesses are doing better than most
5642281 in our survey of members for the second quarter of this year there was clear evidence that the trading environment was very tough with half of the companies who responded having to face rising raw material and overhead costs and a general slowdown in new orders and sales despite this 33 of companies reported growing employment compared to only 13 reducing jobs with the majority of new posts being full time
5642282 we have seen some high profile failures in recent months and there has been a predictable downturn in construction but most sectors have performed well including local retail which is bucking the national trend by exhibiting growth
5642283 we believe that there are local factors that provide at least some short term insulation against the worst of the credit crunch
5642284 weve been talking for about three weeks here to try to come up with a resolution and the citys come up with a proposal that well present to the commissioners to take a look at
5642285 it looks like they may be going off on a frolic all by themselves

5642287 nortels icp is a powerful collaboration application which is a valuable addition to our contact centre and unified communications portfolios we believe it will provide incredible value to our jam ip clients by giving them a broad range of choices for how they want to interact with us
5642288 the collaborative qualities of unified communications are creating an opportunity for businesses to touch more customers at less cost to build their loyalty through more compelling interaction and to achieve a strong competitive differentiation

5642295 the pag ibig borrower who pays p3 700 now and has become delinquent and qualifies in this bill will be paying only around p2 400 that difference will be a very big help
5642296 we managed to secure the commitment of the government financial institutions to relax the rules at the same time we ensured that this will not unduly set back the actuarial security of the funds especially pag ibig which depends on member contributions and originally borrowed loanable funds at a higher interest rate

5642309 een gemiddelde auto zoals een opel astra of een volkswagen golf kost elk jaar 4 974 euro
5642310 wanneer een gezin met twee kinderen ouder dan twaalf min of meer dezelfde verplaatsingen met het openbaar vervoer wil doen is het meer dan 10 000 euro per jaar kwijt
5642311 ons doelpubliek is het woon werkverkeer en het woon schoolverkeer voor die mensen hebben we w l interessante tarieven de gemiddelde prijs voor een gezin ligt hier tussen de 1 200 en de 1 300 euro per jaar
5642312 in vergelijking met 2007 is er in belgi maandelijks een miljoen liter brandstof meer verkocht aan nederlandse verbruikers in juli 2008 voerde de nederlandse overheid een accijnsverhoging in waardoor de verkoop in begli steeg tot 2 twee miljoen liter de cijfers van augustus tot nu toe tonen aan dat deze trend zich voortzet
5642313 er zal dus in augustus nogmaals twee miljoen bijkomen in totaal is dat 10 miljoen liter dit hebben we berekend aan de hand van de omzet van een brandstofleverancier die een vijfde van de markt voorstelt je kan dus stellen dat er de voorbije maanden ruim 50 miljoen liter brandstof in belgi werd getankt
5642314 in ons filiaal in maasmechelen krijgen we ook meer en meer nederlandse klanten over de vloer veel vrachtwagenbestuurders maar ook autobestuurders tegenover vorig jaar mag ik spreken van een stijging van tien procent dat heeft trouwens ook te maken met roltabak die in ons land net zoals brandstof gewoon veel goedkoper is dan bij de noorderburen
5642315 ik heb me ook laten vertellen dat heel wat nederlandse transportbedrijven hun brandstof rechtstreeks bij belgische leveranciers kopen om de eigen bedrijfsciternen te vullen
5642316 nederlandse bedrijven komen inderdaad rechtstreeks bij ons grote hoeveelheden diesel kopen maar daarnaast zien we ook een stijging wat betreft de aanvragen voor tankkaarten
5642317 wij hebben daarom een rechtszaak aangespannen en de rechter heeft ons gelijk gegeven
5642318 in belgi nederland en frankrijk leeft soms de idee dat je met kuifje alles mag doen dat iedereen daarvan gebruik of misbruik kan maken maar dat is natuurlijk niet zo als je er een verbastering van maakt moet je ter verantwoording worden geroepen

5642327 plots werd er hard op de deur van ons appartement gebonsd
5642328 ik had niets gemerkt en ook mijn hond snoopy had niet geblaft mijn zoon lag hier gewoon te slapen
5642329 het is de eerste keer dat ik hier zo vroeg in de ochtend een groep mensen moest opvangen
5642330 we konden het hier gauw gezellig maken voor de dertien mensen die hier moesten schuilen om 7 30u mochten de bewoners weer naar hun appartement terugkeren
5642331 ik vond het maar normaal dat ik hem betaalde en voor zijn optreden beloonde hij woonde toen nog in een piepklein kamertje heel triest
5642332 ik hielp hem door mijn contacten in de muziekwereld en intussen stopte ik hem wat zakgeld toe ik heb hem uit de goot geholpen
5642333 wij wilden starten met de voorbereidingen voor het nieuwe schooljaar dat komt door de brand trouwens niet in gevaar op 1 september gaan wij open
5642334 een automatische centrale meldde een technische storing maar toen ik onderweg was kreeg ik telefoon van onze poetsvrouw zij zei me dat ons secretariaat in lichterlaaie stond ze was aan het werk op een andere plek in het gebouw en had niks gehoord
5642335 ik woon op vijf minuten van de school maar ik reed letterlijk achter de ladderwagen van de brandweer aan die was net als de politie zeer snel ter plaatse
5642336 ik verwacht dat wij voor minstens 25 000 euro schade hebben het ergste is dat onze stamboeken met oud leerlingen en dure handleidingen verloren zijn

5642340 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5642341 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5642342 as for me well my shoulder is getting better fast range of motion is improving greatly and pain is becoming less and less an issue ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything as i stated yesterday the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time

5642410 mit rund 25 jahren berufserfahrung sehe ich es als gro e chance und herausforderung an der theore tischen ausbildung einen soliden praxisbezug zu ge ben
5642411 bei american dream habe ich mich stets gut aufgehoben gef hlt auch schwierige fragen wurden stets geduldig beantwortet
5642412 i think it sprung up in a real short span of time
5642413 overall i see it as a knee jerk reaction to the peterson savio situation
5642414 i dont see that economically in the long run that we could accomplish it in our budget
5642415 how will this county board find the money to fund this proposed medical examiner system
5642416 is this what the tax paying families of will county deserve a politically motivated rush job
5642417 i truly believe that if a medical examiner had been in place kathleen savios death would have been ruled a homicide four years ago
5642418 that her family would not have had to endure the torment of an exhumation to confirm their fears and that they might have justice instead of pain and sorrow
5642419 i believe in my heart that had kathleen savios case been properly handled my sister would most likely be alive today
5642420 i dont know that theres anyone who could keep the senate democratic caucus together like emil
5642421 it could force rod to work closer with the general assembly
5642422 find a way to work with the speaker without throwing the governor under the bus
5642423 i want to thank the many people throughout the years whove honored me by sending me to springfield to represent them as well as the members of the democratic caucus who have elected me their leader for the past 15 years
5642424 the world has seen that even today there are political morons who are ready to kill innocent and defenseless people in order to satisfy their self serving interests while compensating for their own inability to resolve complicated issues by using the most terrible solution by exterminating an entire people
5642425 i think that there should be no mercy for that we will do our best not to let this crime go unpunished
5642426 you just dont move more than 1 200 tanks and 15 000 soldiers into a country within 12 hours without previous planning
5642427 were talking about pulling our troops away to the borders of south ossetia they will not be on georgia territory
5642428 russians have committed to withdrawing and they need to withdraw and so that is what we are looking for
5642429 the proportion of cases reporting complications or fatal outcome is similar to that observed in the general population with pancreatitis
5642430 ensure that our byetta product label continues to provide physicians and patients with information about the risk of pancreatitis
5642431 in accordance with our strict internal processes we continuously monitor and notify regulatory authorities of adverse events reported during the use of any of our drugs
5642432 people who are type 2 diabetics have a high triglyceride level a leading cause of pancreatitis
5642433 however i think it is super important that the company and fda monitor this thing closely to be sure
5642434 exactly why i said might not and if you look at the pics on the site i sent you they look pretty much the same but one thing that is certain is that the 790i ftw has more sata ports and thats good for everyone but in that link you sent me i didnt see anything that spoke about the sata ports or the flopy drive i didnt see that forum befor though i thank you for showing me ill be subscribing to it for updates but i wouldnt really be surprises that the new ftw board would sacrafice a floppy drive for some more sata i think its possible might also be posible that they kept the floppy and added sata that would be really nice i hate having a couple sata burners and loosing almost half my sata ports cpu intel core 2 extreem qx6850 stock idle temp 20c 23c load temp 56c cpu cooler coolit freezone cpu cooler thermal compound arctic silver 5 mobo evga nforce 680i sli stock idle temp 45c load temp 45c ram 4x ocz ddr2 pc2 8500 sli ready edition dual channel stock ram fan dominatorram cooler gpu dual evga 8800 ultra black pearls in sli stock idle temp 37c both psu ocz gamexstream 1010 watt hdd 3x wd raptor 150gig in raid0 array dvd lite on lh 20a1l sata lg hl dt st dvdram gsa 4167b ide case thermaltake kandalf lcswith swiftech pump the big one and micro res 1 2

5642436 you should be at the camp to focus very important to focus
5642437 you cant be thinking about the rain coming the cows needing pasture you have to be away so that they can be independent so that they can think for themselves
5642438 i normally call this half marathon a tune up race i have to go see test i go there one month before the race marathon when i come back i have to evaluate where was my weak part was it endurance was it speed so i have to work on my weak part so that during the race i know that i am comfortable
5642439 you should be thinking about how you are going to win it and you know winning is money i am not saying i am not after money i am after money but i dont put money on my mind because it will destroy me during the race what i put in my mind is winning

5642451 the hard won gains of our troops hang in the balance
5642452 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines
5642453 whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5642454 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5642455 when you came out against the war early we celebrated you
5642456 when you talked about bringing the troops home we backed you and then you have backpedaled and compromised a little bit on were going to send the troops to afghanistan instead of bringing them home
5642457 i guess this explains why his tax plan gives hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax breaks to people making more than 2 5 million because i guess theyre middle class

5642469 our goal is to keep animals out of the shelters
5642470 the people at the rescue groups spend so much time working with the animals they dont have the energy to think about how to keep them from coming into the system
5642471 we kept thinking perhaps theres something we can do to find out why people give up their pets and to help keep them in their original homes

5642475 i bought 400 worth of food the last time we went and paid 67
5642476 every month we give out somewhere between 100 and 150 bags
5642477 you see such joy on peoples faces when they hear youre going to feed their pets
5642478 well be interviewing clients who need rental assistance or help with their utility bills and when we start talking about their pets the attitudes immediately change all the barriers fall
5642479 im not ruling it out but right now were so swamped with our primary focus of feeding families we havent been able to put it in place anywhere else
5642480 but cfa isnt the only place we could do it
5642481 were thinking about meals on wheels programs and other senior services programs for example
5642482 we highlight the animals on our web site companionanimaladvocates org and they go directly from their original home into a new home not into a rescue foster home or a shelter
5642483 any new jersey family that qualifies for a low income assistance program is eligible to get their pets spayed or neutered for a 10 co pay
5642484 there are elderly pet owners or owners who become ill and need help walking their dogs or who cant get a 50 pound bag of pet food up to their apartments
5642485 there are all sorts of possible programs that we havent yet begun to explore but that were trying to identify

5642532 we hear so much doom and gloom that the more computer games young people play the more stupid violent and anti social they become
5642533 yes playing violent computer games all day long can trick the brain into thinking it has to respond and make someone become more violent
5642534 but playing smarter computer games can actually help modify our abilities in problem solving visual attention working memory forming and modifying strategies even creativity
5642535 the impact comes from the way we use the technology and how that interacts with each individuals existing characteristics and predispositions
5642536 if we can make the brain adapt to violence then we can make it adapt to all sorts of experiences and positive ones at that
5642537 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind

5642542 it is vital that we are constantly monitoring the future health needs of the wa community
5642543 it is important to note that the review included all cancer services including those funded by the commonwealth and the private sector
5642544 cancer services in wa are of a very high quality but we acknowledge that there is always room for improvement
5642545 the 65million expansion of the state cancer centre at sir charles gairdner hospital will start next year and will provide easier access to treatment for thousands of cancer patients
5642546 the expanded centre will be seven times the size of the existing stage one cancer centre which opened in 2006
5642547 we are also expanding cancer services in our secondary metropolitan hospitals and regional hospitals to ensure people can receive more of the treatment they need closer to home
5642548 there are challenges in providing specialised services to such a vast state and the wa cancer and palliative care network is developing a state wide plan for cancer services
5642549 a shortage of cancer specialists is an issue across the county and wa health is actively seeking to recruit new staff

5642552 the audience is in a superposition of understanding and not understanding
5642553 culture brings the past into the present and projects it into the future culture reinforces precedents and carries forward tradition culture provides for stability and continuity and in that way can be a very good thing culture can also resist change and innovation smothering personal freedom creativity experimentation and progress in business company culture can cut both ways if the external realities are fairly stable and the company has a strong identity and culture that is in alignment with those realities then culture contributes to success however when external circumstances change dramatically requiring equally substantial change within the company a strong culture can often interfere with the companys ability to adapt unless the culture is one that values rapid response creativity and innovation and readily embraces change quite often culture gets in the way of a companys ability to change
5642554 good writing has to be based on good speech and good speech is a logical though complex development from natural speech it is a striking feature of our culture that so much creative activity in literature as in music and painting should be either explicitly academic or explicitly resistant to education a culture either of brahmins or of dharma bums

5642642 all countries where appropriate should develop and implement resettlement programmes that address the specific problems of displaced populations in their respective countries
5642643 participating eligible communities flood insurance may be written only in those communities that have been designated as participating in the national flood insurance program nfip by the federal emergency management agency fema
5642644 prior to the creation of the nfip floodplain management as a practice was not well established only a few states and several hundred communities actually regulated floodplain development
5642645 since the federal government does not have land use authority the nfip is based on the federal governments power to spend under the constitution rather than any federal authority to regulate land use
5642646 under the nfip regulations participating nfip communities are required to regulate all development in sfhas
5642647 when a community chooses to join the nfip it must adopt and enforce minimum floodplain management standards for participation
5642648 floodplain management refers to an overall community program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing future flood damage these measures generally include zoning subdivision or building requirements and special purpose floodplain ordinances
5642649 no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided unless an appropriate public body shall have adopted adequate land use and control measures with effective enforcement provisions which the director finds are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use
5642650 if a community chooses not to participate flood insurance is not available from the nfip moreover if a president declares a disaster as a result of flooding federal financial assistance will not be available for the permanent repair or reconstruction of insurable buildings
5642651 communities must ensure that their adopted floodplain management ordinance and enforcement procedures meet program requirements local regulations must be updated when additional data are provided by fema or when federal or state standards are revised
5642652 all countries where appropriate should develop and implement resettlement programmes that address the specific problems of displaced populations in their respective countries
5642653 after the great flood of 1993 thousands of properties in flood plains around the midwest were bought out by the government now weeks after the latest massive flood buyouts are again being considered in at least five states missouri iowa wisconsin indiana and illinois residents in areas that qualify can choose to sell their properties to their city or county with 75 percent of the costs paid by the federal emergency management agency communities that use the fema dollars agree to demolish structures on the properties and not develop the land except for recreational use such as parks
5642654 despite the wide array of tools and techniques to operationalize the principles of sustainable development
5642655 ironically the time immediately following a natural disaster provides a community with a unique window of opportunity for inserting an ethic of sustainability in guiding development and redevelopment in high risk areas with forethought and planning communities that are rebuilt in the aftermath of a natural hazard can be built back so that they are more resiliant to future hazards breaking the pattern of repeated hazard destruction rebuilding at the same time the community is given the opportunity to incorporate other attributes of sustainability into its second chance development such as energy efficiency affordable housing use of recycled building materials reduction of water use and environmental protection

5642731 for a majority of the weapon system programs gao reviewed costs have exceeded the funding levels initially planned for and reflected in the future years defense program fydp dods investment strategy to compensate for these shortfalls dod makes unplanned and inefficient funding adjustments like moving money from one program to another deferring costs into the future or reducing procurement quantities
5642732 dods flawed funding process is largely driven by decision makers willingness to accept unrealistic cost estimates and dods commitment to more programs than it can support dod often underestimates development costs due in part to a lack of knowledge and optimistic assumptions about requirements and critical technologies

5642794 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5642795 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5642796 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5642797 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5642798 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

5642800 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

5642805 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

5642861 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte

5642863 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5642864 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5642865 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5642866 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5642867 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5642868 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5642869 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5642870 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5642871 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5642872 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5642873 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5642874 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5642875 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5642876 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5642877 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5642878 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5642879 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5642880 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

5642885 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5642886 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
5642887 something that i think needs to be worked out particularly among the states that have hurricanes
5642888 you realize that a tiger following its nature is not evil looking at your own species you are less kindly less compassionate less understanding it is easy to condemn your own kind

5642890 thousands of young people on princes trust schemes support their community every year with many actively volunteering to help older age groups there are young people across the uk with energy and enthusiasm that if harnessed could be a powerful force for change
5642891 older people clearly have an important role to play in their communities and many already give much of their time and expertise to others as grandparents carers and volunteers
5642892 negative ageist stereotypes often disappear when different generations come together and learn to understand and appreciate each other breaking down barriers in this way undoubtedly lays the ground for building stronger communities
5642893 we share the same streets and supermarkets and this research shows that contrary to popular opinion we do know each other
5642894 people of all ages want to know the people who live around them and to feel part of a community and enjoy socialising and supporting each other uk older peoples day on 1st october is the perfect opportunity to build on this and get to know older people in your neighbourhood making sure no one is left out whatever their age

5642907 rusia debe ser consciente de que su comportamiento tiene consecuencias
5642908 rusia est alardeando deliberadamente de su potencia militar en el territorio de su diminuto vecino y antigua colonia georgia bajo el pretexto del mantenimiento de la paz los tanques y soldados rusos han penetrado en el pa s y han destruido infraestructuras militares y civiles han bombardeado la principal l nea de ferrocarril y han bloqueado las carreteras ayer algunos segu an avanzando hacia el sur a pesar de que mosc insist a en que se estaban replegando el comportamiento de rusia ha socavado el argumento de que simplemente ha intervenido por motivos humanitarios
5642909 cuando los ministros de exteriores de los aliados de la otan celebren una reuni n extraordinaria hoy en bruselas para considerar la situaci n tienen que encontrar una respuesta s lida y unitaria
5642910 la invasi n de georgia fue enteramente injustificada y nosotros debemos fortalecer al apoyo de su deseo de unirse a la otan
5642911 la crisis de georgia va m s all de los problemas vitales y las necesidades humanitarias y del estado de derecho sobre el de la fuerza destaca el problema fundamental de si rusia puede y c mo desempe ar un papel pleno y leg timo en el sistema pol tico internacional bas ndose en unas normas y ejerciendo sus derechos pero respetando los de los otros la posici n brit nica es que la agresi n no puede y no va a redibujar el antiguo mapa de las fronteras de rusia debe respetarse la integridad territorial de georgia deben obedecerse las leyes internacionales el desmoronamiento de la uni n sovi tica cre una realidad nueva especialmente pa ses independientes y soberanos con sus propias ideas y derechos que defender muchos de los cuales ya se han unido a la uni n europea y a la otan ucrania y georgia quieren unirse a la otan y sta ha dicho que s y sta debe ser su elecci n
5642912 la crisis en el c ucaso muestra que la otan debe desplegarse con m s rapidez para proteger a sus miembros pero es tan importante como siempre
5642913 no ha habido una provocaci n tan clara como inundar osetia del sur y parte de georgia con tanques rusos hasta ahora la otan se ha debatido en cuanto a su respuesta pero eso no la hace irrelevante sino todo lo contrario la otan tiene 60 a os la edad de la jubilaci n para la mayor parte de su personal hasta la guerra de georgia la jubilaci n parec a una opci n para la misma otan el 8 de agosto proporcion un momento de claridad la impunidad con que las tropas de mosc entraron en georgia mostr que el principio de la seguridad colectiva en la que se basa la otan contin a siendo la nica garant a seria para las fronteras de sus miembros

5642918 el ej rcito ruso podr a quedarse en osetia del sur para siempre
5642919 el presidente de osetia del sur eduard kokoity ha declarado que tiene intenci n de dirigirse a rusia con la petici n de que sta despliegue en el territorio de la rep blica una base militar esta medida ser a imprescindible para evitar nuevos intentos de cometer un genocidio contra el pueblo oseta la principal dificultad reviste un car cter jur dico internacional sin embargo en opini n de los expertos los obst culos podr an salvarse si rusia mantuviera una posici n activa en relaci n con las rep blicas no reconocidas pediremos a los dirigentes de rusia que desplieguen una base militar en el territorio de osetia del sur dado que aqu viven ciudadanos rusos pero la decisi n depende de ellos declar kokoity ayer
5642920 la administraci n estadounidense est intentando colgar a rusia la etiqueta de mal chico por sobrepasar el mandato de pacificaci n y utilizar la fuerza desproporcionada en la operaci n de restablecimiento de la paz en georgia puede que nuestros amigos estadounidenses est n ciegos y sordos al mismo tiempo saakashvili el presidente de georgia tiene fama de nacionalista duro que no ha ocultado sus intenciones de forzar a los osetios y a los abjasios a vivir en su pa s la respuesta rusa est plenamente justificada y es coherente tanto con el derecho internacional como con los objetivos humanitarios de la operaci n de mantenimiento de la paz llevada a cabo en osetia del sur
5642921 al llevar a cabo su acci n militar las tropas rusas tambi n han observado estrictamente las exigencias del derecho humanitario internacional los militares rusos no han sometido a objetivos civiles ni a poblaci n civil en el territorio de georgia a ataques deliberados es dif cil creer que en semejante situaci n cualquier otro pa s se hubiera quedado de brazos cruzados
5642922 sin esperar un hipot tico plan de relanzamiento concertado a escala de la ue los pa ses buscan respuestas a nivel nacional espa a ha sido el primer pa s que ha anunciado el 14 de agosto una serie de medidas para intentar relanzar la maquinaria especialmente para impulsar el poder adquisitivo de acuerdo con la l gica econ mica francia tambi n deber a adoptar medidas contra c clicas o dicho de otro modo medidas que fomenten la actividad empresarial y el consumo pero a diferencia de varios de sus vecinos no dispone de recursos presupuestarios
5642923 por tanto francia se encuentra en una situaci n parad jica ante la penosa coyuntura internacional el ejecutivo no se muestra dividido sobre la oportunidad de las medidas de relanzamiento sino sobre la de un plan de rigor el ejercicio impuesto al presidente y al gobierno podr a compararse con la cuadratura del c rculo salvo que esperen como desde hace a os que su salvaci n llegue de una posible mejor a de la coyuntura mundial
5642924 francia ultima un plan para evitar la recesi n en la eurozona

5642930 la dimisi n del presidente musharraf ofrece al nuevo gobierno paquistan la oportunidad de centrar su atenci n en los problemas econ micos del pa s que suelen ser un caldo de cultivo id neo para los extremistas de toda ndole si los adversarios del antiguo hombre fuerte de pakist n no logran ponerse de acuerdo en breve sobre las cuestiones pol ticas los extremistas y los grupos terroristas podr an aprovechar la circunstancia por lo que el gran aliado en la lucha contra el terrorismo podr a convertirse en un nido de rufianes en un estado a n m s peligroso que el ir n de los ayatol s

5642950 attempts to elicit answers from the department for children and the ministry of justice have resulted in buck passing so the failure of schools to respond is not surprising
5642951 no one really knows enough about the use of cctv in schools its a very new issue
5642952 certainly we would want staff to be involved in decisions about the use of cctv in schools and strict safeguards for its use
5642953 it is ok to monitor pupils but not to spy on the grown ups
5642954 worse it is habituating children to a very high degree of surveillance whilst at the same time destroying the potential for them to learn about relating to adults
5642955 we have had reports of how in some schools cctv monitors sit in staff rooms teachers increasingly tend to intervene in critical situations in a policing or disciplinary role the human to human contact is lost
5642956 i can only assume that paltrow either is ignorant of the facts or lacks human decency and compassion

5642958 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
5642959 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5642960 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5642961 the difficulty with this calf in our view is that it probably hasnt weaned itself from its mother and that is why it is taking to yachts the prognosis isnt good
5642962 its heart wrenching but the reality is that in the wild for various reasons mothers sometimes reject their young
5642963 im going to do this and think like this because i dont believe in leprechauns

5642969 we are honored to become a member of this elite group of r amp d 100 award winners whose inventions have contributed so much to society
5642970 this award is a wonderful testament to the talented team of designers hardware and software engineers microarray and biochemistry experts who have worked tirelessly over the years to take a complex expensive and time consuming process gene expression analysis and turn it into a simple reproducible and affordable one where results remain consistent even when samples are run by different people at different times or in different sites
5642971 we are appreciative of the due diligence from both frost amp sullivan and ibo and are honored by their respective recognition in evaluating waters synapt hdms and xevo tq ms
5642972 waters mass spectrometry is experiencing significant momentum in the marketplace our scientists have developed novel innovations and the beneficiaries have been our customers who are realizing new levels of success in reaching their own goals and achievements
5642973 this unique combination of technologies allow scientists to differentiate samples by their size shape and charge as well as mass which has enabled the separation detection and characterization of components not possible with conventional mass spectrometry
5642974 the xevos novel collision cell design enables it to operate in t wave tm mode or in waters more recently developed scanwave mode t wave has the effect of significantly improving the fast scanning abilities of tandem ms
5642975 perhaps the more interesting capability is the scanwave mode of the collision cell which helps xevo to significantly increase the signal intensity of both parent and product ion spectra

5642988 this is a very vulnerable population and they need this service
5642989 it was a very expensive piece of equipment and it was only in service for a few years and were going back to the same people every year asking for money

5642993 the three of us have had some amazing times training and sightseeing here in china
5642994 however i think i can speak for all of us when i say we are very ready to begin competing
5642995 i have set my expectations high for this competition but feel they are very realistic
5642996 my goal is to make the finals and once there leave everything on the track i feel that i have the tools needed to make the final and once there i will do everything in my power to bring home a medal
5642997 for me approaching the olympic games is quite different than preparing to compete in u s trials
5642998 at the trials i was one of the favorites to make the team and i was also competing in front of my home crowd those things add a certain amount of pressure that can be tough to deal with
5642999 out here i dont think i am expected to make the finals and though i am racing in front of five times as many people i feel less pressure because im not at home obviously the level of competition is much greater here at the games but i feel confident in my ability to rise to the occasion
5643000 i have made so many new friends and had so many interesting experiences
5643001 the chinese people have been incredible and the olympic village is something else
5643002 ive always considered myself a citizen of the world and to sit down in a room and hear a dozen different languages being spoken at the same time is awesome
5643003 ive made an effort to go outside of the usa track and field team to meet athletes from other teams and other nations and im pleased to see how friendly everyone is
5643004 andrew will take one race at a time and will approach the prelims with the same energy that he used throughout the olympic trials in eugene
5643005 i expect him to be a good competitor and to set himself up to advance
5643006 the reality of all of this is that this is a new and exciting experience for him
5643007 intellectually i think that it will be a tall order to advance however he has been able to accomplish some incredible goals this year and rise to the occasion
5643008 we called him the local celebrity because he seemed to know everybody and everybody seemed to know him from standing out there
5643009 he used to hold the sign out front every day in the snow and the rain and whatever and they just loved him out there

5643019 weve changed our culture of instruction to one thats very highly collaborative
5643020 were going to see a lot of gains across the board

5643045 to create a truly powerful brand you need to establish a sense of belonging friendship and dependability between product and customers
5643046 the only way to have a friend is to be one
5643047 it takes time for brands to develop strong bonds with their customers infatuation is exciting the basis for those late night infomercials but infatuation never lasts it turns into either ambivalence or attachment depending upon how well the brand promise is delivered

5643057 having a long history as suppliers to the costume jewelry making trade gives us an unusual perspective on what markets may be seeking and we try to fill that need sometimes even before they know they need it or want it after 104 years one might think that a jewelry findings manufacturer would run out of ideas for new items however it seems the opposite is true ideas for new items turn up almost every day

5643060 how many people enter their home and then just start dropping stuff all over then they have a hard time remembering where they left something the idea was to have all your personal things you need with you in one place when you leave the home that way you are less likely to forget something

5643133 so i hook up and the only thing hes got downloaded is classical music
5643134 how about we take some time out right after practice and kill ernie
5643135 no big deal we got other guys who can play guard
5643136 hey i heard we got two new players on the team
5643137 needham you know those two white guys we saw in the gym last week
5643138 okay so othello s a play about this brother who was a general but was married to a white chick
5643139 the brother was uptight and worried that the chick was stepping out on him and this guy he trusted iago started whispering in his ear about what was going on behind his back i think iago didnt like black people
5643140 mr lawson shakespeare described othello as a moor but theres no reason to believe that his actual skin color was black that probably would not have been acceptable in elizabethan england
5643141 the guys picture on the cover showed he was a black man
5643142 we happen to be studying the author not the publisher
5643143 as soon as i came to flagstaff i felt at home in a way i hadnt felt probably anyplace else ive ever lived
5643144 its the people its the arts its the free exchange of ideas the natural surroundings
5643145 right now my drivers license has my flagstaff address and im registered to vote in flagstaff i care more about flagstaff
5643146 it sounds terrible because ive had a home in the valley for 16 years now
5643147 like many of us they would say boy when i can i would really like to live in one of these beautiful scenic areas
5643148 and as they get close to retirement they can fulfill those wishes
5643149 you get the wave of the baby boom which is bigger than the wave before it and on top of that the baby boomers are more likely to purchase these second homes or amenity homes or move to these areas
5643150 people come to the nice little mountain town so pretty soon guess what they want to live here or at least have a part time home
5643151 start to change it into the place where they came from another park or some walking trails near their home or god forbid a starbucks
5643152 they certainly push the housing market up and the people who want to live here and stay here full time cant afford the houses
5643153 so either they struggle or theyre forced to move somewhere else
5643154 one income families here city officials might as well put up a sign that says stay away
5643155 because unless you come with wealth its hard to make it here
5643156 i was surprised that even once you found it you werent getting paid enough to stay in flagstaff
5643157 people would give their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff and they are giving their eyeteeth to stay in flagstaff
5643158 and one of the things that struck us was in los angeles in the big metropolitan areas youre kind of anonymous
5643159 and here youre walking down the street and people are saying hi to us and nodding and making eye contact
5643160 and you know it was a little uncomfortable at first because were not used to this
5643161 so here we are and my husband is still working in california and commutes back and forth
5643162 he flies out on monday evening and comes home friday morning so hes home for the weekends meanwhile im up here living in paradise
5643163 the chamber of commerce and the boosters have sought growth for as long as i can remember
5643164 its not going to be majorly different but hopefully the melodies will be nicer the guitar solos will be better the production will be better you just try to improve in every area
5643165 there isnt much to change but yet there is the last three albums have been very much guitar orientated and this one probably will be as well but i want to try to do some extra coloring in with the vocals
5643166 bands always say our new album is faster and heavier and then its never true so were not gonna say that but playing fast just works for us people who say we play too fast are probably right but guess what theres a million other bands that play slow people listen to dragonforce and go to the show because they know that were doing something other bands arent doing
5643167 nyrstar came in with results below consensus estimates mainly driven by an unexplained cost of 46 million euros at the gross margin level
5643168 despite a falling zinc price and weakening dollar exchange rate we have continued to focus on managing factors that are within our control
5643169 through a combination of prudent and disciplined management we have improved production of both zinc and lead metal and maintained largely flat costs in an inflationary environment
5643170 men who are unhappy like men who sleep badly are always proud of the fact
5643171 economic growth has been sluggish against the backdrop of high energy and materials prices and weaker growth in exports
5643172 wij hebben het geloof dat we nu het gevecht aankunnen met
5643173 why do so many lives fall apart at 40 because things havent worked out how we hoped and weve had to turn to plan b the drama is all about the crisis caused by things not turning out as the characters planned
5643174 this is very much not the world of the american series thirtysomething where everyone is a smug high achieving yuppie with a perfect life
5643175 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
5643176 big deal there are tons of so called on line courses
5643177 i get a lot back from this in that im really interested in the future of education
5643178 wir sind nun besser positioniert f r eine phase der outperformance in europa
5643179 die wachstumszahlen sind in europa derzeit so schlecht dass sie wahrscheinlich irgendwann eine zinssenkung in erw gung ziehen wenn die inflation ihren gipfel erreicht hat

5643213 mrmovie is geboren als msn buddy we waren aan het brainstormen over een gepersonaliseerde nieuwsbrief met gepersonaliseerde filmladders maar ik had net gelezen dat vooral jongeren niets hebben met e mail ze zijn allemaal aan het msn en laagdrempelige filminformatie geven op maat moest dus via msn en zo werd mrmovie geboren de mobiele ontwikkelingen kwamen wat later heb je op de gewone website eenmaal een account dan is er geen andere site die zo snel en handig de films toont die in je favoriete bioscopen spelen
5643214 in januari 2007 is de chatbot officieel begonnen het eerste jaar hadden we meer dan 75 000 unieke gebruikers vde teller staat nu flink boven de 100 000 dagelijks gebruiken meer dan 2000 mensen mrmovie om te chatten de mobiele website is vooral populair onder iphone gebruikers voor onze persberichten van deze week was 1 op de 3 bezoekers een iphone gebruiker en deze dagen is dat 50 logisch met het succes van de iphone en het gemak dat je daar op kunt internetten de mp4 trailers die we er nu op hebben zijn ook zo leuk om op je iphone en ipod op te slaan en anderen te laten zien mrmovie al kennen het wordt nu tijd voor een marktonderzoek want ik ben erg benieuwd naar de cijfers over naamsbekendheid

5643217 some of the big carriers tout their ptt services but they have the carrier barrier limitation of locking their customers into their networks and only the handsets the carriers support

5643219 warner bros production and anticipated release of the watchmen motion picture violates 20th century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen property
5643220 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
5643221 we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project

5643226 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous

5643233 people like bill gates warren buffet dont need their prescriptions underwritten by taxpayers
5643234 those who can afford to buy their own prescription drugs should be expected to do so
5643235 now if you take zocor youre paying about 10 times what those in the va system pay just because the va system was allowed to negotiate for prescription drugs
5643236 and the medicare benefit we decided we wouldnt do it that obviously is an enormous mistake
5643237 its not going to save you a lot of money until you start to pull down what you treat as high income to a much much lower level than most people think of as high income
5643238 to get substantial resources youd have to talk about making changes that would affect people who have incomes of 50 000 or less
5643239 its either going to be taxpayers or the beneficiaries of the program or the people who provide the services and nobody wants to tackle any of those groups because theyre all going to scream very loudly if they suddenly have to bear a lot of the burden of the future of medicare

5643252 de opbrengst van de waardevermeerdering verdwijnt nu in hun zakken en het publieke belang komt in het gedrang bovendien betaalt de toekomstige woningeigenaar te veel geld voor zijn huis de prijs van een nieuwbouwwoning is immers inclusief de grond andere gevolgen zijn de machteloosheid van de overheid het gebrek aan transparantie en het op achterstand zetten van het algemeen belang processen zijn vaak oncontroleerbaar omdat bij de deals een beroep wordt gedaan op de concurrentiegevoeligheid van de informatie

5643257 de kleine lettertjes onderin beeld die hen hadden moeten waarschuwen zijn zelfs op tvs van een meter breed amper te lezen dubieuze aanbieders negeren vaak afmeldingen en blijven mensen bestoken de telecomproviders zeggen dat zij niets kunnen doen wat niet waar is maar lopen intussen wel binnen de consument moet beter beschermd worden tegen deze praktijken

5643260 tidak wajar mempolitikkan isu sebegini dan pihak pihak tertentu yang menggunakan nama islam dan syariah untuk kepentingan tertentu harus berhenti sama sekali dari berbuat demikian
5643261 pum pp juga menyatakan bahawa pendakwa saiful tidak ada keperluan untuk melafazkan sumpah memandangkan beliau adalah di pihak yang membuat pertuduhan
5643262 dalam syariat islam kes ini diklasifikasikan sebagai kes hudud dalam bab zina dan pendakwa wajar membawa bukti mengikut syarak bahawa perlakuan liwat berlaku dan perkara ini akan dibicarakan di mahkamah selaras kaedah feqah
5643263 perkara yang berlaku ini akan memberi kesan buruk antara lain kepada perlaksanaan sistem kehakiman syariah di malaysia apabila pada masa akan datang pelbagai pihak boleh menggunakan ini sebagai
5643264 proses pembuktian dan pengadilan akan diketepikan dan pihak yang bersalah boleh memilih untuk menggunakan sumpah yang tidak memerlukan pembuktian bagi menyelamatkan diri dari penghukuman
5643265 pumpp juga menyeru agar beberapa ulamak dan agamawan untuk merujuk dan menerima pandangan ulamak dan pakar lain sebelum membuat apa apa kenyataan yang bakal memburukkan keadaan dan tidak memungkinkan proses keadilan dan penghakiman dapat dilaksanakan dengan sempurna di negara ini
5643266 dalam hal ini dan apa juga masalah semua pihak digesa untuk merujuk kepada prinsip taawun seperti mana yang ditekan oleh al quran

5643290 fuel raises the bar in terms of scale and exhilaration for racing games we begin with the largest racing environment to appear in gaming ever with our accelerated effects of climate change and dynamic weather system we add an extra dimension that change races on the fly and constantly presents new challenges to players
5643291 player choice lies at the heart of fuels action packed races and with a huge range of vehicles packs of up to 16 vehicles speeding across diverse terrain and a no boundaries no limits approach to racing means players have never had so much freedom to conquer the wilderness and take the chequered flag
5643292 the technology asobo studios has developed to build fuel is ground breaking to create a game on this unprecedented scale to this level of graphical quality complete with all the dynamic weather effects is a great achievement
5643293 fuel had to be a special title for codemasters to include in our racing portfolio and we believe that from both a gameplay and a technical perspective fuel compliments our long standing tradition of driving excellence

5643417 im glad that gary is here as we had some great times playing together at accrington stanley hopefully we can rekindle that
5643418 he basically sold the club to me as he loves it so im hoping i can replicate the good start that he has made here
5643419 he gives us more competition for players and is a player i have been aware of since my burnley days when he was at accrington
5643420 if id known then what i know now then id have done things differently

5643423 difficult to think how much lower our collective reputation might sink

5643447 it was explained to me that because i had been out for four months with injury that the national coach wanted to see me back in action
5643448 the fact that i am in the under 21s will not affect my game and i aim to make sure it will not be long before i am in the senior squad hopefully i will be back with the big boys again very soon

5643474 i am happy with the throne speech focus on sovereignty and improving the well being of inuit
5643475 but i remind the government that sovereignty cannot be divorced from battling climate change in the arctic
5643476 i dont see how listing it as threatened will complement the sustainability of the population it is climate change that is the problem not the sustainable hunting of polar bears
5643477 even with the sport hunts we use dog teams a portion of tags also go toward subsistence harvesting and we ensure that all the meat and other parts of the polar bear are fully utilized
5643478 our hunters and guides benefit economically and we are able to continue with our culture enjoy the benefits of what we use and ensure that this is done in a responsible and sustainable manner
5643479 i remember the birmingham game and what happened to eduardo the lads were winning 2 1 but then in the last minute gael gave away a really stupid penalty
5643480 there were an awful lot of other similarly negative things happening everything began with eduardos injury then came gaels error and that thing with william
5643481 you could say that was probably where the ground started to crumble beneath our feet
5643482 he played brilliantly all season he improved immensely and turned into a great defender as a result but he messed up that day
5643483 it was not an easy situation on the other hand it was williams first season as captain and its not easy to wear the armband in a team like this
5643484 i think he will have learned there were things he could have done better but he knows that better than anyone else
5643485 hes really immersed in everything and that was something he just got immersed in too deeply but otherwise hes a good leader in my opinion and he will continue to be captain even though there was speculation about that
5643486 were more experienced now precisely because of what we have gone through we took a huge step forward
5643487 at the end of last season we finished just four points behind the winners manchester united

5643500 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
5643501 understanding how differentiated states are specified might help us figure out how to remind cancer cells to go back to their original tasks or fates or more likely die
5643502 these things are a complete out of left field surprise

5643510 the politics of the arctic are no longer the politics of the people but they are the politics of oil
5643511 when local organizations and institutions lack power local interests are likely to be neglected so that costs are borne disproportionately by local residents while benefits accrue primarily at the regional and national levels
5643512 if the coastal resources on which we rely are polluted

5643551 captain mainwaring is my favourite he remind me a bit of that bumbling old fool mussolini i know he will make very good england skipper john terry and rio ferdinand are just little boys compared to the great mainwaring
5643552 lets face it captain mainwaring is an incompetent idiot he doesnt even know how to read a 24 hour clock my bet is he wont even turn up to wembley on time how old is he anyway 152 capello will be begging me like a dog to be the new england captain by thursday morning if he licks my balls i will probably think about it
5643553 i have been watching the england team with interest from the other side
5643554 i hope we can get at least 14 or 15 guys simply because we need the substitutions so that those playing on both days dont exhaust themselves on the saturday
5643555 in a response from players and fans alike pfc decided now was the time to launch an interactive forum where we can get some fun filled discussions and debates going on
5643556 weve noticed that nobody was commenting on the articles on the official website for whatever reason but a forum provides a more interactive discussion and allows the players and fans alike to start discussion it should be a great experience for all
5643557 of course our concern is for him and that he doesnt risk further injury but im sure eddy knows his body well and will know exactly how much he can give or whether or not he needs to rest speaking on behalf of the team i can say were all ecstatic to have him back

5643571 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and is of tremendous importance for the team you want your own fans to be behind him

5643622 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

5643637 uninsured drivers dont intentionally try and kill other road users so these laws are unlikely to act as a disincentive to the vast majority of uninsured drivers

5643649 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5643650 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5643651 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5643652 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5643653 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5643654 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5643655 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5643656 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5643657 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5643658 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5643659 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5643660 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5643661 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5643662 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5643663 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5643664 progress is impossible without change and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything

5643666 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5643667 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5643668 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5643669 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5643670 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5643671 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5643672 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5643673 to the best of my knowledge the majority of oil executives feel we need to reduce the number of refineries

5643684 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5643685 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5643686 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5643687 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

5643713 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5643714 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5643715 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5643716 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5643717 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5643718 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5643719 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

5643723 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5643724 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5643725 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5643726 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5643727 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

5643766 throughout the 19th century the revolutionary left literature is full of invidious remarks about the jewish insistence on self affirmation and survival the assumption was that in a free national society there would be no room for the maintenance of jewish particularism it was assumed that the destiny and duty of jews was to disappear in the universal utopia when zionism came on the scene as the product not only of specific currents in judaism but also of european nationalism the phrase nationalism no longer had about it the fine glow that it possessed in the days of garibaldi recently we have witnessed the rise of the new left which identifies israel with the establishment with acquisition with smug satisfaction with in fact all the basic enemies let there be no mistake the new left is the author and the progenitor of the new anti semitism one of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti semitism and anti zionism is not a distinction at all anti zionism is merely the new anti semitism the old classic anti semitism declared that equal rights belong to all individuals within the society except the jews the new anti semitism says that the right to establish and maintain an independent national sovereign state is the prerogative of all nations so long as they happen not to be jewish and when this right is exercised not by the maldive islands not by the state of gabon not by barbados but by the oldest and most authentic of all nationhoods then this is said to be exclusivism particularism and a flight of the jewish people from its universal mission
5643767 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains

5643854 lets start cooking before you start chewing on the couch
5643855 youre so silly risa chan how did you get muffin mix on your face
5643856 im really sorry risa chan but i have to cancel our date today
5643857 my sister suddenly came down with something and it seems really bad so im going to take her to the doctor
5643858 youre so selfless risa chan im surprised that youve not been in a relationship yet
5643859 thats not what i meant i thought that you took your sister to the doctor
5643860 have you got any ideas of what we can do
5643861 youre so silly risa chan how did you get muffin mix on your face

5643871 the ball is in the governors court and she still has an opportunity to pick up that ball and do what she chooses to do with it
5643872 it is probably as offensive if not more so for the majority of detroiters to wait that long
5643873 i dont think theres any question as to the governors authority
5643874 the governor is perceived as politically independent while the council has political rivals of the mayor
5643875 we think that its problematic for the governor to sit as judge jury and executioner
5643876 were taking kind of a wait and see approach with the governor
5643877 the governor has the authority to do it i dont question that
5643878 my point is that she should exercise her discretion against deciding to remove the mayor because this would overrule the right of the people of detroit to make their choice as to who will be their mayor
5643879 this issue is not just detroit the issue is the state of michigan
5643880 going forward we are hopeful that due process fairness and innocence until proven guilty will be principles that all elected officials in michigan can agree upon rather than allowing media hysteria and political opportunism to set their agendas
5643881 council does not have the authority to go beyond the plain language of the charter
5643882 im not going to knock the people who served on the last charter commission but i think there are some areas of the charter that deserve revisiting and which may need to be rewritten
5643883 we have other proceedings going on as everybody knows we will proceed with the governors hearing for removal were raring to go and interested in going

5643885 actually someone did come here to apply to protest with a form but i dont know where he got it from
5643886 we dont have any forms here we cant give any to foreigners
5643887 we didnt even consider applying for a second because for us it is clear that the protest zones are just part of chinas cynical public relations tactic
5643888 the protest application process clearly isnt about giving people greater freedom of expression but making it easier for the police to suppress it

5643905 i think it should be based on sound science and if something gets listed there should be a recovery plan in place immediately with a kind of a level of when do you know the tank is full and then once that happens then whatever that species is comes off the list
5643906 pretty important i think from a self belief point of view its important for our guys to know that they can compete with sides that have been right up there for the entire year
5643907 i think also from a direction point of view as much as i can sit here and say i believe in our younger group of players and that i think were very even in a group of players coming through for them to actually see themselves

5643924 while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5643925 we have not seen any significant russian movement out of georgia today
5643926 if it rolled in after aug 6 it needs to roll out
5643927 obviously if anyone thinks he can kill our citizens our soldiers and officers who are serving as peacekeepers and go unpunished we will never allow this
5643928 anyone who tries this will receive a devastating response for this we have all the means economic and political and military if anyone had illusions about this some time ago then they must part with those illusions now
5643929 we do not want to aggravate the situation but we want to be respected and our government to be respected and our people to be respected and our values
5643930 the patience of our soldiers in trying to uphold the primacy of the peace process is very commendable but at some point we really have to act decisively
5643931 we regret the loss of lives and property in lanao del norte but we would emphasise that the milf leadership has not authorised these actions
5643932 if they cant control them the government will certainly control them and we will undertake our mandate to protect the people and the communities and we cannot renege on that constitutional mandate
5643933 we will pursue and take aggressive action against the perpetrators of the dastardly acts committed against innocent civilians

5643951 politically we need to reassert our commitment to its territorial integrity and like the eu last week to immediate international engagement with the long term settlement of the frozen conflicts
5643952 practically we need to confirm the commitment made at the nato summit in april to membership for ukraine and georgia and to follow it up with serious co operation militarily and politically as part of a structured route map to eventual membership
5643953 now were told before its even started that the next
5643954 but this latest desperate relaunch will sink just like the others have because under labour britain has become more unfair
5643955 this autumn we are going to step up the pressure to make sure that gordon browns obsession with his own short term survival does not do long term damage to britain that would not be fair
5643956 the truth is gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair

5643960 m amp a activity in the eastern european telecoms markets should continue to be intensive for the coming 18 months apart from long pending privatizations such as that of telekom srbija we expect a range of start up operations from the current wave of cdma and wimax license tenders these start ups are often backed by financial investors and will eventually become the object of transactions
5643961 as market growth slows down competitive intensity increases putting pressure on operating margins we can therefore expect that in the midterm telecommunications operators in eastern europe will face increasing pressure to consolidate in an ambition to realize cost savings or to simply take a competitor off the market operators that are currently benefiting from many years of strong revenue growth will start to feel the pressure to realize savings by taking over others we can therefore expect a new wave of cross border and intranational mergers in eastern europe as we have been observing in western europe for several years already

5643972 we just felt so blessed that we were getting a chance to do another crazy adventure in a country we knew nothing about
5643973 and i am deathly afraid of needles so i wasnt that excited about that
5643974 for the first two weeks we were in mumbai rehearsing there
5643975 that city is kind of like indias l a sort of vibe its really super busy packed with people its like new york with crazy traffic
5643976 and then we spent the rest of the time in a beautiful country area with beautiful landscapes and insane architecture
5643977 it was more like stepping out into the country like when you step out of l a and go to orange county youve got more green areas
5643978 i think its about how a lot of times especially for girls you start to realize that you dont have to do the same things that your friends do and its almost as important to respect each others differences and different dreams
5643979 its kind of like an inside look into what a bollywood film is all about just a vibe of lots of huge musical numbers with lots of dancers
5643980 the coolest thing is that its really how people dress in india
5643981 thats what so great about this movie you really get a sense of cows roaming in the streets elephants in the street all the crazy things you see there
5643982 ive had a ton of stuff as far as what ive been doing with myself
5643983 it ends up spinning out of line and she discovers how hurtful that can be
5643984 at this point we have three soundtracks one album and even a christmas album and also songs from different disney cds
5643985 i still have a personal life im lucky enough to work with people who are my best friends so any time youre at rehearsals its like were hanging out
5643986 i think right now were just really supporting each other
5643987 he came to the premiere but hes got a lot on his plate getting ready to start another season of dancing and his album
5643988 i just want to say thank you again especially to all the fans that are in orange county
5643989 i have gotten so many great responses from them and so much support that i couldnt be more proud
5643990 brian mulroney the most electorally successful tory prime minister since john a macdonald is on the sidelines waiting for the public inquiry into his dealings with karlheinz schreiber to commence
5643991 the only good thing now is that well there arent many left
5643992 and i think the airport is doing its best to tear down those properties
5643993 if we put the fires out the people who light them are going to keep on lighting them
5643994 the whole neighborhood is an embarrassment and a slap in the face to the former residents
5643995 im still kinda freaked out because i cant believe it happened like that in our sleep
5643996 jim was a private man who thrived as a fisherman outdoorsman and painter yet he understood business and he had an enormous talent to see what was important and then connect his product be it candy or cola or beer or the then broken and ridiculed patriot franchise to the public
5643997 he was very capable very creative he was a great leader
5643998 at one time we were ranked as high as no 8 in the world
5643999 jimmy used to say the joke was so successful that he felt like the priest who shot a hole in one on sunday he was afraid to say a word
5644000 i feel were a lot farther along than i expected but weve got work to do
5644001 weve got a long way to go before were anywhere close to where we were last year but were on the right path were gluing together a lot better than i thought
5644002 weve lost a couple of guys every year ive been here im not interested in waiting on guys to catch up with the veterans they have to get up there its their job to get in position ive put a lot on the older guys to put pressure on the young guys and bring them along
5644003 i dont think we took a step back at all
5644004 but elvis has really come along and thats why we made that move
5644005 weve got some good guys with a lot of inexperience
5644006 time will solve that problem it always takes time it took us a while last year but if youre good it doesnt take nearly as long
5644007 what well do is put the best players at their best spots

5644022 do not the most moving moments in our lives find us all without words
5644023 in the end we still prefer our old charades gestures or a good phrase book for communicating in most everyday situations
5644024 this lake seems like its full of fish lets have some fun fishing
5644025 that pond it seems me many multiplied of fishes let us amuse rather to the fishing
5644026 here is some peaches what does ripen at the eye sight
5644027 a word is dead when it is said some say
5644028 its hard to execute because you need to be fortunate opportunities have to arise and we were fortunate this off season
5644029 basketball people in the nba have a high regard for andre iguodala because of all his attributes
5644030 a lot of people were saying gosh you turned down a lot of money last year but we looked at it as a challenge
5644031 together we had the belief in what he can do as a player it obviously worked out for him
5644032 i want to improve as a player in this city
5644033 andre had one guy guarding him and another four guys waiting on him
5644034 its extremely difficult to do something with that and thats why we made it a major goal of ours to go out and get that other piece to help us to help andre we did it when we got an elton brand type
5644035 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5644036 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5644037 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5644038 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5644039 it wasnt like i got second by three tenths or five tenths i had the same score thats what makes it a little harder to take
5644040 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging you do your routine and you turn it over to the judges thats what weve been going through our entire lives and weve come to accept it
5644041 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5644042 shes done her hard work and her preparation she definitely deserved her gold medal
5644043 im passionate about this project i think its very special
5644044 ill be doing what i do best setting trends and making sexy television ill be taking the rule book and tearing it up
5644045 ill be boldly going where no television executive has gone before
5644046 its the script that initially gets you excited its really funny and that i think comes from the honesty in the characters the fact that its so character driven and the humour comes from the situations they find themselves in
5644047 ranjit is the joint leading goal scorer with malky terrys son as a result of this terry and dr kaskar are deadly rivals constantly fighting and bickering with a lot of one upmanship whereas the kids get on well love the game have other hobbies and interests and are basically altogether more grown up than their parents
5644048 my boy is only 15 months old and i am looking forward to kicking a ball around with him but i wouldnt dream of treating him like that
5644049 also im not a big fan of football ill watch important matches but only in the company of others and with a drink in my hand
5644050 but hopefully a lot of the audience will be the same they might learn something from the series and be able to relate to the situations in life we laugh because something is funny and we laugh because it rings true
5644051 luckily im not expected to play football properly thats the responsibility of the kids there was a fantastic scene when they had rain machines in and terry and i were covered in mud taking penalties against each other and it was just such fun
5644052 if serbia gets that far well be ready for them
5644053 we knew coming into spring training he would make the rotation
5644054 we slipped him right into the three hole and hes done a great job we watch his pitch counts and try to rest him but his stuff is as good now as it was early in the year it shows how hard hes worked
5644055 its a form of reverse evolution rendering the numbers of the best players with the best karma obsolete
5644056 this is the number of craig biggio for two decades he gave more effort and got more out of his ability than anybody in his generation honor his memory
5644057 die in the fight for the gold instead of surviving just for the sake of participation
5644058 a thousand silver medals is not as good as one gold
5644059 for a long time i got very depressed with anxious and complex feelings
5644060 they probably took the ioc web site as the closest thing
5644061 on that you will find countries listed by order by gold medal total and not the total
5644062 i think the old director came out of the military system
5644063 he was really good at what he did he got it into marching order theyre still aiming for the most gold medals but the overall atmosphere has changed in the past four years theyre catching up with world trends with less of a military influence
5644064 they use modern sports psychology rather than political thinking that said lets win glory for the nation now individualism is not only allowed it is encouraged they recognize the audience really likes it earrings funky hairstyles
5644065 he would never give up as long as he can run
5644066 hes going to get some practice time in there this week
5644067 he played very good football this past week not only from the backfield carrying the football but he was taking special teams very seriously
5644068 just from playing last year you understand brian is going to play and there is not much room for a lot of other guys to play you know you want to get onto the field any time they want to put you on the field its a good thing
5644069 hes a big guy so he can definitely take a pounding
5644070 just being able to do it in a week and be really good at it its probably going to be tough
5644071 but that is not what it is they did it now studying the position isnt really the thing playing running back you know the fullback position
5644072 i know its a challenge for him to learn a new position with blocking schemes and stuff
5644073 its going to be something to sit back and watch hopefully hell do well with it
5644074 im going to have to put more time into it as far as the position change goes its not one of the easiest but fullback and tailback go hand in hand
5644075 pass blocking is the same its not like i have to learn too much more for the most part you know a lot of the fullback responsibility from being a running back i would say its just the run blocking
5644076 hes a great kid he wants to be on the field he doesnt care where he plays he wants to play well give him a shot
5644077 the u s a hasnt really had a great showing so far and we wanted to uplift the track team with the sweep
5644078 i knew america was struggling a bit but i knew we could be the heart of the team that could bring it back
5644079 right now the way were playing we get him out of there in the seventh or eighth inning he has had a couple of key hits for us hes not swinging the bat the way we think he can swing it but i think he has helped everybody out to relax a little bit at the plate and get better
5644080 someone picked up on omar saying it and its stuck with me ever since
5644081 you see him in on a lot of plays out there so i think his progression is going well he certainly makes it hard for offenses when you have a guy like that whos strong and who can run and who can hit
5644082 not only do you have to know the plays for yourself but you have to tell everyone else whats going on
5644083 its just a matter of learning the defense and having a grasp of it at the middle linebacker position where youre in charge of everything he just has to continue to learn
5644084 it was unfortunate laporta had to go down because of things that went on earlier
5644085 if the ball wasnt cut off it would have been a bang bang play and nobody would have said anything
5644086 we do not teach that in china or in the united states
5644087 it was a low blow to throw at his head
5644088 i think it was brutal to throw at his head you can hit guys in other places thats part of the game
5644089 thats baseball but you never hit the guy in the chest thats an illegal slide the umpire should have ejected him thats where the game got out of hand
5644090 the last one laportas beaning really bothered me i hope the fans dont get the wrong impression of the game
5644091 i came into the 2004 olympics just out of college
5644092 i was very nervous but i told people when you make the final anything can happen i had a far throw and nobody else stepped up
5644093 after about 15 minutes of video i started to walk back to the room
5644094 and who did i see walking in my direction gerd kanter that was a good sign for me
5644095 im not going to be disappointed it is disappointing to know i had a legitimate chance for that podium my last throw i set it up i did everything i wanted to do and the disc just got away from me
5644096 i just came up short its always a learning experience and getting to the second day is an accomplishment for me
5644097 im more worried about whats going to happen tonight really all you have to do is win the game and theyll cheer they want a winner we want to win theyll cheer if we win and if they dont oh well
5644098 its like man what was i doing last year ive watched my highlight tape i look at things and im like got it i come in here and try to repeat it sometimes it happens sometimes it doesnt but even last year i was looking at myself going ok got it id go into the game and i was able to repeat it over and over and over and over and over this year i just havent been able to repeat it over and over and over and over and over and over thats the only difference
5644099 defensively hes had some real good games yeah hes been hustling he does early hitting in the cage some days and every now and then he comes out and hits early last year he probably took early hitting hell maybe not at all hes never done that hes probably done more this year than he has in the past
5644100 ive been hitting with my foot in the air a lot if the foot isnt down youre not going to have a good swing youre not going to see the ball anything you can put with a bad swing thats what happens when your foot is in the air your timing is off when your foot is down you recognize pitches earlier you see them better youre able to make a better decision and naturally because you see them earlier you can put a better swing on it you have a better chance of doing something close to what you want to do with the ball
5644101 i think it is hard being prideful when you have a younger brother and a younger sister
5644102 your whole life is trying to lead the way and you have to share nothing is ever yours because you have to bring them in thats part of it
5644103 the worst expletive deleted fans in the world front running expletive deleted
5644104 i didnt know anything about this illness at all nor did any of my friends
5644105 but ive found out that around one person in 100 will experience it at some time and so in an average secondary school with 1 000 pupils there are about 10 that could be affected
5644106 that really shocked me and had me thinking maybe i already know someone who could be affected and i dont even realise it
5644107 its really opened my eyes to the suffering that people go through and what a terrible effect this illness can have on someones life
5644108 the chance to play this part came out of the blue
5644109 jag och anna hade helt enkelt olika syn p hur man driver en tidning
5644110 the first soccer player to appear in fhm in a five page photo spread
5644111 shes been very professional the way she treated her body she wanted to get back we gave her time
5644112 i think thats one of the special things about two athletes dating
5644113 youre having your highs youre having your lows youre there for one another i think thats a really really special part of our relationship
5644114 i want to be recognized for my talent on the field i work every day for it hopefully eventually ill be recognized for that
5644115 if i can win another gold that will definitely help
5644116 jag och anna hade helt enkelt olika syn p hur man driver en tidning
5644117 many michigan families are struggling as a result of the
5644118 remains in place subject to future modification by the trial court as appropriate
5644119 we have exclusive photographic evidence pictures videos hard proof to further incriminate edwards he doesnt at this point know what we have which is why im asking that we dont reveal too much yet and which we will use unless and until he acknowledges paternity
5644120 she believes theyll be together in future because elizabeths health concerns make it just a matter of time whatever hes said in her mind the clock is running we know this
5644121 although edwards has this loyalist andrew young trying to claim its really his baby in order to take the heat off edwards we know thats false

5644124 mom and dad say i should make my life an example of the principles i believe in but every time i do they tell me to stop it
5644125 i have decided that in the best interest of both uconn and myself that i will not play college basketball this year
5644126 both uconn and i require a 100 percent dedication to the sport and as of now i feel i cannot give that level of commitment it therefore would be unfair to their excellent program coach geno auriemma the team and uconn fans for me to play
5644127 coach auriemma and the team have been extremely understanding during this time of my transition from high school to college and i thank them for that i am especially grateful to coach auriemma whose kind wisdom has shown me why uconn is such a class program
5644128 i intend to enroll at the university of delaware for my freshman year this fall
5644129 it takes time but i think he did good out there
5644130 today was a big step for him he did a good job i was impressed with his instincts when we switched off a couple things hopefully come game time hell be 100 percent
5644131 everyone kind of knew i didnt warm up properly i talked to trainers about it its something were going to be doing pregame especially for late games with the monday night games we have i need a routine to get up in the mornings and get going
5644132 it feels good but there definitely is some weakness in there im trying to get the strength and range of motion back a bit but its healing pretty good
5644133 it hurts a little bit just in evaluating the young players giving them game experience and opportunity and then seeing them over the long haul of things
5644134 hes so big and so global now im sure well try to top it
5644135 we had hoped to have it end at johnny unitas stadium but that may not cut it
5644136 it has always seemed a shame to me to relegate veterans who would like to play in mainstream events to sections restricted to the over 60s or whatever throwing golden oldies like bent larsen on the scrapheap is all too common my belief is that our invite to bob far from being a negative move was a blow against ageism in chess bob may do badly indeed he may do very badly but he wanted to play and i think his involvement is an interesting departure
5644137 for us to release this we have to protect our interests and include a drm in the release
5644138 i dont like the drm its too invasive i wont support the games release
5644139 seriously i dont think you put much thought into this particular reply because only an idiot would throw away everything on an ideal such as
5644140 stephen has really shown his true worth to the team this season and is undoubtedly one the leading batsmen in the country
5644141 he and daryl mitchell are fast becoming one of the most reliable opening partnerships in the county championship and i am pleased we will see this partnership develop over the next few years
5644142 i know that stephen has aspirations to play for england and it is well known how committed we are to developing players for england
5644143 i am really pleased to continue my career with worcestershire i am looking forward to taking the field with the current squad of talented players and competing for trophies and championships in the future

5644161 me parece interesant simo todo el debate alrededor del kindle en primer lugar tengo que aclarar que todav a no he tenido uno en mis manos he visto las fotos en amazon y en e blog de ana romero la moderadora pero no me puedo hacer a la idea de lo mucho o poco pr ctico que puede llegar a ser soy de las que siempre por sistema llevan un libro en el bolso lo inc modo es cuando ste tiene un volumen de 600 o m s p ginas y adem s te tiene tan enganchada que no te puedes permitir el lujo de dejar su lectura solo para los cortos ratos de cama antes de dormir entonces el bolso pesa much simo todo el d a y vas con un hombro ladeado mientras lo arrastras a partir de lo que hab is comentado ya me ha venido una reflexi n que no se si compartir is el audiovisual en internet est ganando terreno a la letra escrita s lo hay que ver la evoluci n que han tenido sistemas de distribuci n gratuita como youtube o similares y el auge de los fotoblogs y vblogs y lo que queda por llegar con la tv ip de creaci n propia aunque esto ser a para otro foro en algunos momentos he llegado a pensar que el texto la letra escrita se ir a quedando sin espacio por otro lado desde hace ya una d cada se habla de la muerte del libro de lo poco que se lee sobre todo en espa a etc paralelamente estamos viendo como las intermediarias del texto el audio y el v deo es decir editoriales discogr ficas y productoras de cine est n buscando soluciones a lo que consideran pirater a en internet pero con el kindle y aparatos similares que aparecer n se nos abre todo un mundo por explorar en el terreno del texto un libro ya no ser nunca m s algo cerrado acabado donde el lector es pasivo y los comentarios los hace a otros que han le do el mismo t tulo esto no lo digo yo que todav a no he tenido en mis manos un kindle sino qui n entiende el kindle como una herramienta al estilo wiki donde los lectores se convierten en participantes activos para anotar complementar a adir comentarios y pensamientos al contenido original

5644170 will be missed so much by his close knit family who loved him so much
5644171 having surfaced there appears to have been problems trying to start the small rib and the father subsequently called for help from a passing charter boat who came to assist
5644172 it is at this point that all parties have lost sight of the young boy
5644173 louis started diving lessons when he was 12 under a brilliant diving instructor gaining open water diving qualifications in june 2006
5644174 he could even handle the boat himself to perfection he also enjoyed fishing and water skiing
5644175 brixham has always been a special place to louis from when he was first born he loved going there at weekends with all his close family around him
5644176 louis was such an adorable precious son who loved life
5644177 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
5644178 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
5644179 hes definitely one of the greatest athletes ive ever seen in my life
5644180 its humbling for me and for kobe bryant it was unbelievable especially for myself
5644181 going against greece and spain those were easy to get up for this game it might have been easy to come out and have a game where afterward we make excuses but we didnt take a step back and it felt good
5644182 were a good team getting back to square one but its still getting back to square one for the medal round
5644183 but it is also the start of another one because theres no way of predicting what will happen to me afterwards
5644184 im hoping it will be sufficient for me to think about working again which at the moment is impossible
5644185 i never know when im going to have another attack it would be great if i could reduce that enough to live a reasonably normal life
5644186 and were just lucky that nature has provided us with these nerves which connect into that system

5644212 der schusswechsel im tschad bei dem gl cklicherweise keine sterreichischen soldaten verletzt wurden best tigt die gef hrlichkeit dieser riskanten auslandsmission w hrend darabos immer wieder beschwichtigte hat sich die fp von anfang an gegen diese mission ausgesprochen nicht nur aufgrund ihrer gef hrlichkeit die interne heeresstudien belegen die der verteidigungsminister ignoriert sondern auch wegen der postkolonialen interessen frankreichs die dadurch bedient werden
5644213 bedingt durch die gro artige arbeit und die gute ausbildung unserer soldaten ist bisher niemand verletzt worden bevor es jedoch dazu kommt dass ein sterreichischer soldat f r franz sische interessen schaden erleidet sollte der verteidigungsminister den einsatz auslaufen lassen anstatt ihn zu verl ngern um sich bei der eu liebkind zu machen
5644214 darabos berdehnt mit dem einsatz auch die mittel des heeres da der einsatz heeresinternen berichten zufolge viel kostenintensiver wird als der verteidigungsminister offiziell zugibt eine internationale studie hat j ngst festgestellt dass sterreich gemessen an seinem wehrbudget berdurchschnittlich stark bei auslandseins tzen engagiert ist die fp bekennt sich voll und ganz zur landesverteidigung und zu sinnvollen auslandseins tzen die auch sterreichischen interessen dienen aber eine verantwortungsvolle politische f hrung setzt die soldaten ihres landes nur dann risiken aus wenn dies im sinne der sicherheit der bev lkerung erfolgen muss
5644215 in diesem zusammenhang w re es f r die w hler interessant zu erfahren wie die sterreichischen parteien zum lissabon vertrag stehen sind sie bereit die demokratische entscheidung der iren zu respektieren oder folgen sie den anweisungen br ssels
5644216 w hrend die freiheitliche partei sterreichs als einzige politische kraft unseres landes eine konsequente linie verfolgt klar und unmi verst ndlich f r die interessen sterreichs eintritt und dieses vertragsmachwerk ablehnt sieht die vp ihre rolle als befehlsempf ngerin der eu zentrale wie diverse wortspenden von vizekanzler molterer und au enministerin plassnik belegen und auch die gr nen bejubeln die eu
5644217 sp chef faymann und noch bundeskanzler gusenbauer haben sich in einem leserbrief an den herausgeber der kronenzeitung f r sterreichische volksabstimmungen ber k nftige eu vertr ge ausgesprochen hier stellt sich aber die frage warum faymann im nun beginnenden wahlkampf nicht ausspricht da nach dem nein der iren der lissabonner vertrag gescheitert ist
5644218 im april haben die orangen im nationalrat den lissabon vertrag zwar abgelehnt aber noch vor drei jahren haben sie der de facto inhaltsgleichen eu verfassung zugestimmt

5644220 die aussagen der wiener vp sind scheinheilig denn die stadt wien hat sich sozial schwacher menschen immer angenommen w hrend der schwarz blau orangen bundesregierung ist die zahl der sozialhilfebezieherinnen aber dramatisch gestiegen es war die politik der vp gef hrten bundesregierung die die soziale notlage der menschen versch rft hat
5644221 wien hat in den letzten jahren sozial schwachen regelm ig einen heizkostenzuschuss zukommen lassen und zwar zus tzlich zur heizbeihilfe die ganzj hrig ausbezahlt wird daneben wurde das unterst tzungsangebot f r sozial schwache laufend ausgebaut erst in diesem jahr wurde es um den mobilpass erweitert
5644222 wir sind weltmeister im spital liegen und daran wird sich leider so schnell auch nichts ndern wenn ich mir die unflexiblen und planlosen strukturen in der wiener gesundheitspolitik anschaue

5644238 we remain dedicated to finding and prosecuting the person responsible for nilanthans murder irrespective of whether the incident is racially motivated or otherwise

5644242 genuine risk was an amazing horse with tremendous heart that lived a life befitting a champion
5644243 there were periods when i wished i was able to tell people about my condition
5644244 but now even at the age of 29 i dont want to go out on the streets without my make up
5644245 there are millions of people who do wear make up each day for different reasons and i am just one of them but i dont feel i could go out without my vitiligo covered up which sounds pretty sad
5644246 but it is just the way it is for me
5644247 wearing no make up for the ads was good i had been in front of strangers without make up for a short time but with the video a much wider range of people have seen it
5644248 of course my family have seen me before without make up as has my boyfriend and some very close friends
5644249 but even people i work with havent so doing the advert was a big deal for me
5644250 as a child of four i have to admit that i was blissfully unaware of any difference between other children and myself
5644251 i never experienced any animosity cruelty or name calling and for that i must be eternally grateful as not everyone is so fortunate
5644252 it is only when you are a teenager and start staying over at other girls houses that it becomes a bit of a pain having to put the make up on and take it off and i did not feel comfortable telling people who were not in my family
5644253 and when you are a teenager it is all about how you look
5644254 the colour match was so perfect that it meant i didnt have to tell anybody unless i wanted to
5644255 however by not being honest with people other than my family i still was not accepting the fact that this was likely to be with me for the rest of my life and i still had never asked myself if this was something i could cope with forever
5644256 teenagers and people in their early 20s are the most susceptible to psychological and emotional trauma experienced at the onset of the condition
5644257 people with vitiligo dont tend to go swimming or wear a summer dress because of the taboos associated with the skin and because of our obsession with a perfect body and especially the skin

5644266 i dont think my mind set has changed any since april
5644267 more consistent pound the zone if you can show guys youre ahead in the zone theyre going to swing at pitches early in the count that arent necessarily good pitches to hit i was able to do that tonight
5644268 ill be honest i didnt know a lot about him before i got here
5644269 but its pretty obvious to me after being here that hes one of the better pitchers in this league
5644270 thats part of my job driving in runs and youve got to have guys on base to do that
5644271 its a testament to those guys im just trying to be a complement to the puzzle
5644272 probably the biggest struggle ive had all season with my stuff
5644273 my fastball command was not there i walked a lot of guys it might have been the toughest outing of the season for me as far as laboring i had to work hard to get through five and get a couple more
5644274 weve been coming back all year long and so were expecting one of those games
5644275 youre not going to win them all but obviously thats one of the better teams in the american league east and the american league for that matter theyve got a great bullpen and lester gave them a great start tonight
5644276 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5644277 the pendulum is swinging very heavily in the direction of it just being over ive never sat around and not gotten ready to head to florida well not in 23 or so years anyway so to me that will likely be the last real test for me and whether or not i want to put the time and effort into getting after it one more time
5644278 next i started thinking about the original plan of pitching the 2nd half of next season thing is that urgency just is not there i miss some things i didnt think i would and dont miss many things
5644279 we all want to play and score goals and baskets
5644280 but we want the student athlete concept to be primary
5644281 it was sort of a momentum shift what can you do thats the ballgame
5644282 a nice easy swing on it and put it down the right side
5644283 the preseason is important but i think the idea is to be ready for when the regular season kicks off
5644284 im doing good doing good just wishing i could have been out there last night
5644285 ill try to get treatment this week im feeling better every day
5644286 training camp is very physically demanding theres some things that come up whether it be a foot or an arm
5644287 its just trying to be smart trying to understand its a long season and not going out there and aggravating something
5644288 we made it far but we still had a lot of fun
5644289 we didnt take it too seriously so thats why we did so well we were so happy to be there and figured we would do the best we could
5644290 but judith trotzky greenland had an outstanding tournament she did not lose one game in the district tournament
5644291 we have a really strong deep team and we are all very excited at the same time we dont know what to expect because no one from wentworth has ever gone this far we are hoping to at least win one match
5644292 but we are just trying to take it one step at a time we are just happy to be at sectionals
5644293 we really have nothing to lose so we are just going to do the best we can
5644294 the thought of looking like this when im 57 is terrifying
5644295 having seen these images i can honestly say i am never going to use a sunbed again
5644296 you can so easily get brown from a bottle these days there is just no point in ruining your looks and risking skin cancer by using sunbeds
5644297 i hope the horrible image of me will make other young people think twice before they next use a sunbed
5644298 while young people may be using sunbeds as they think they make them look good now in the long term they are doing serious damage to their looks
5644299 sandi thom only used sunbeds three times a week which we would not regard as causing overexposure to uv rays
5644300 sunbed users are very aware of the risks associated with uv overexposure and most have less than 20 sunbed sessions a year

5644303 really just playing smart and getting everything back deep and cross court
5644304 i want to play college tennis and see where it takes me from there
5644305 because you work so hard all year and you want to move on
5644306 we live by being aggressive and that was the winning run
5644307 he was just outstanding he is a pure hitter he has a batting cage in his backyard and he swings all day
5644308 we needed to ride on his shoulders to get the job done tonight and he did it
5644309 he has a hard fastball and he knows how to use his other pitches
5644310 i usually try to keep my cool and composure on the mound
5644311 it was sort of a momentum shift what can you do thats the ballgame
5644312 a nice easy swing on it and put it down the right side
5644313 we made it far but we still had a lot of fun

5644318 we really have nothing to lose so we are just going to do the best we can
5644319 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5644320 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5644321 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5644322 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5644323 we feel like were playing very well right now but you have to keep in mind its single elimination

5644382 i know warner brothers is not only in the business of making movies they are in the business of making money so on that level i understand why they want to make a sequel of new jack city as fast and as cost efficient as possible but new jack city is a franchise and a movement and a template if there was no new jack city there would be no nino swagger available for sean carter sean combs dwayne carter and clifford harris to study and become jigga t i there would be no paid in full and there would be no the wire so for warner to do a direct to dvd new jack city without wes snipes mario van peebles and myself is almost like doing the godfather ii with the cast of 70s sitcom barney miller its a stinker but it is what it is

5644400 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5644401 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5644402 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5644403 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5644404 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5644405 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

5644413 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5644414 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5644415 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5644416 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5644417 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5644418 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5644419 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5644420 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5644421 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5644422 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5644423 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5644424 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5644425 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5644426 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5644427 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5644428 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5644429 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5644430 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5644431 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5644432 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5644433 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5644434 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5644435 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

5644447 mark had travelled a very long way to be at the rwb and his speech went down very well
5644448 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5644449 what we have been discussing in brussels in preparation to accra is that on part of the partner countries are not all that positively interested in division of labor because they fear maybe and that is my translation that this will decrease opportunities for them

5644451 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5644452 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5644453 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5644454 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5644455 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

5644457 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5644458 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5644459 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5644460 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5644461 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5644462 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5644463 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5644464 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5644465 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5644466 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5644467 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5644468 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5644469 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5644470 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5644471 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5644472 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5644473 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5644474 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5644475 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5644476 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5644477 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5644478 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5644479 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5644480 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5644481 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5644482 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5644483 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5644484 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5644485 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5644486 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5644487 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5644488 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5644489 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5644490 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5644491 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5644492 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5644493 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again

5644495 we had a fight through the night and it is ongoing
5644496 initially i was a little bit disappointed that the sentence i was aware that maybe a five year sentence so i was pleased with the six but a little bit disappointed that the non parole period was only extended by a short term
5644497 even the guys who placed in front of me and behind me they were guys that i probably would have said were shuffled back or forth or you know wherever
5644498 dont get me wrong i would have liked to be up further toward the pointy end of the field but at the same time it was a great experience i walk away and its still been its all good and im proud of what i did
5644499 it is disappointing when you know youre capable of doing more with 100 per cent preparation with no problems but unfortunately this preparation was dogged with a hip injury
5644500 but ive done my best job i could under the circumstances and im pretty happy with that
5644501 i knew i had trained very well but these guys who were with me at the front were really the big guys
5644502 i just tried to execute my own race as simon went i knew it was going to be tough i just had to bite and fight
5644503 this year ive lost all my races on sprints it teaches you a lesson and ive learned at the right time i guess
5644504 the girls fought a good fight we knew it was going to be a tough game but our girls came back from 8 5 down at the end of the third quarter that was incredible
5644505 to go so close to what is our dream is heartbreaking but weve got to re group weve got a bronze medal to play for and i want to go home with that bronze now
5644506 it is a great rivalry we cannot make any excuses they were a better team today

5644596 they are such a lovely couple they were getting to that age where they could really start to enjoy what they had achieved in life
5644597 she was the better half of me and now my better half is gone im totally devastated
5644598 we only celebrated our ruby wedding anniversary days ago and now she is gone i had just stopped to help as i saw there had been an accident
5644599 i parked my car thinking that my wifes bus must have been delayed by what had happened but it must have been fractionally early
5644600 at virtually the same time the paramedics arrived they were doing their best to help and i was holding a saline drip for them
5644601 then another person who had stopped handed me a handbag and i recognised it i always pick her up so she doesnt have to walk home i couldnt believe it
5644602 its no reassurance to me that i was there at her final moments theres not much reassurance anywhere im devastated
5644603 she had been struck by a car as she crossed the road im being looked after by my family but it is hard my wife was perfect

5644650 it was definitely frightening and there was a lot of whoa what are we going to do next and whats the morning going to bring
5644651 i woke up to people yelling weve got to get out of here
5644652 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side
5644653 there was no way of hiking back there was no way of getting out
5644654 it was so negligent so badly handled not only by the villagers but also by whatever agency was there that i will never go back to that place

5644658 im now in tottenham but no one can disagree with me wanting to follow my dream
5644659 we have two more weeks until the end of the transfer window and i think this will be the most important week
5644660 i read alex fergusons statement that he wants another striker and i hope that this striker is dimitar berbatov
5644661 its been a while so it will be good to get out there
5644662 we think that we may have a case to dispute the grading of the tackle
5644663 theres been a couple of similar incidents this season where players have been given a grade three charge and we think this tackle warrants that
5644664 theyre separated for the moment but are working on it
5644665 its not a divorce right now but theyre taking time apart
5644666 ok the overall result did not happen for us but it was a great run for the team
5644667 friday was slightly difficult to get a good feeling for the car as i had no pre event test once the muneratto team and i had fine tuned the set up though the car felt really good
5644668 when the feeling is good the times can flow easily i am driving better than ever now so from that point of view the event has been a success i really need to work hard to try and get some more outing like this but my ultimate aim is a world rally car results like this help
5644669 i really need to thank my backers they have shown great faith in me its a pity we were not able to give them the win but it am grateful for the opportunity to prove my pace in wrc again
5644670 i tried to be calm which isnt easy for my character and avoid trouble as i have seen a lot of fighting in front of me and behind me oh my god but i enjoyed it
5644671 in the end i am happy but in the second race i was trying to pass jason because in the last three meetings the seat has come strong if you look at the numbers from here until the end of the season it could still be dangerous for me because five points five points five points and he catches me i had to try to catch him but there was no way i was better in the chassis and in the balance of the car but it wasnt as fast in a straight line so i had no possibility to try and pass
5644672 the cars been very good all weekend apart from that one problem
5644673 its very unfortunate as we had the potential to get p6 overall and p2 of the petrol cars which would have been great we both drove really hard to fight back through the field and got an unexpected bonus to get the point at the end
5644674 its not the result we were hoping for at the beginning of the weekend but it shows that in motor racing you should never give up and that is the attitude i always take we saw how hard the team worked to make the repairs and we wanted to push just as hard in the race to say thank you

5644707 as a friendly neighbor china sincerely hopes pakistan will maintain its political stability and economic progress
5644708 pakistan civilian leaders should now move quickly to challenge the taliban and al qaeda which threaten its own stability
5644709 the first challenge is to choose a new civilian president free from any taint of corruption or complicity with past dictatorships the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that mr musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties and rule by decree
5644710 american aid can only make a difference if pakistans leaders are finally willing to face up to the countrys problems
5644711 the civilian leaders must acknowledge a dangerous and painful truth the key leaders of pakistans military and its inter services intelligence agency have long collaborated with armed islamic extremists operating in afghanistan the indian province of kashmir and pakistans own tribally administered regions along the afghan border
5644712 in their eyes these extremists serve pakistans strategic interests in reality these militants kill american and nato soldiers indian diplomats and pakistani civilians
5644713 pakistans leaders will better their odds if they stop pretending that the fight against terrorism is somehow americas problem and not pakistans they will also have to stop pretending that ad hoc cease fires and bribes to insurgent leaders can roll back the taliban threat
5644714 they will be provided cameras for monitoring so that they can take photograph before and after the filling of potholes by september we would complete the repair work
5644715 all the chief engineers have been directed to identify areas which pose regular problems they would also identify the techniques to adopt proper measures for reparing
5644716 the terror elements often work in disguise they change names and function as commoners i appeal to the citizens that to immediately approach the police if they come across any suspicious person or activity
5644717 the southern command chief will train the groups on how to handle emergency situations

5644719 we get 30 to 40 people a day wanting to sell their old iphones but as we dont see any demand for the handset any more we are not buying them
5644720 the phones were unlocked here and could be used with any of the service providers it was an instant hit but now people want to get rid of it as they are waiting for the new handset
5644721 people are willing to sell handsets that cost them rs 25 000 including the cost of downloading applications for as little as rs 10 000 but we are not buying any as we will find no takers for them after the 3giphone is launched
5644722 musharraf is a brave man and has his origins in india
5644723 all indians love him because of his straightforward foreign policy
5644724 when the nic was disbanded in 1993 its leaders had been given a clear mandate to convert the organisation into a cultural body to represent the indian people
5644725 unfortunately no one took up the resolution of the people and that is why today we dont have an authentic organisation representing the people

5644880 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

5644890 wir haben viele verschiedene ideen ich denke all die leiter des teams haben ihre eigenen ideen wie die demo aussehen sollte es macht offensichtlich sinn wenn die probierversion vor dem release des spiels erscheint wir alle glauben dass es wichig ist weil das spiel so anders ist
5644891 es gab vier herausforderungen in der e3 demo es funktionerte gut die idee s he also so aus dass wir das haben und in irgendeiner form den editor ebenfalls integrieren weil das ein v llig unterschiedlicher teil des spiels ist die erschaffung von dingen die anschlie ende betrachtung ihrer verhaltensweise und die teilnahme an wettbewerben
5644892 die art und weise wie stop n swop urspr nglich funktionieren sollte sah so aus dass es teile im original banjo gab die sich nicht freischalteten bis das spiel registrierte dass man die fortsetzung gespielt hat das mussten wir aufgrund der hardware evolution des nintendo 64 ndern es h tte auf fr hen konsolen funktioniert aber nicht mit den sp teren
5644893 das ist der grund daf r warum wir es nie ver ffentlicht haben es war im grunde mein job diese sache zu erledigen ihr k nnt euch also gar nicht vorstellen wie viele fans mich daf r hassen was wir nun tun ist praktisch die gleiche sache es gibt freischaltbare dinge in beiden spielen die zug nglich gemacht werden sobald das spiel bemerkt dass ihr den jeweils anderen titel gespielt habt

5644936 it was difficult we knew that the track would not be one of our favourites but we also suffered from a lack of performance compared to our competition for the third consecutive race we did not score any points which is hurting us after the french grand prix we were fourth in the constructors championship but today we are sixth we are well aware that the gaps are very close and the pecking order can therefore change very quickly
5644937 we received the plans of the circuit a few weeks ago and we have completed our simulation programme these determine the theoretical demands on the engine and allow us to work out the mapping and ideal gear box settings beforehand we will confirm these during the first free practice session on friday morning
5644938 with some slow corners valencia puts emphasis on getting good power from low revs it also seems that the circuit will not be too demanding on the engines thats good news for the teams that like us will use the same v8 which has already raced in hungary
5644939 i think it was probably our strongest result of the season while nelsons finishing position in germany was a better result on paper we were the first to acknowledge that luck played a major part in that result in hungary things were very different as we had two cars racing competitively all the way racing against strong competitors and racing them on equal terms from the moment we arrived there the car was competitive we qualified well we raced well and had to use strategy to get our result the points were very welcome and in the last two races only mclaren have scored more points than us
5644940 it was another strong weekend for fernando although the only disappointment was that we lost out to raikkonen towards the end while i fully accepted that raikkonen had a much quicker car i really thought we had done enough to be able to stay ahead of him at the second pit stop in the end things didnt work out and we missed out on a potential podium but it was still a great result for fernando and equalled his best finishing position from earlier in the season in australia
5644941 we all hoped that after hockenheim he would have renewed confidence which proved to be the case he was calm he was confident and he went into qualifying believing that he would get through to q3 then he went on to drive as perfect a race as he drove in hockenheim without making any significant mistakes he was quick when he needed to be preserved the tyres when he needed to and drove a strong and intelligent race
5644942 you have to remember that hungary is a very particular circuit and although fernando did a great job of keeping raikkonen behind him until the final pit stop this wasnt indicative of the pace of the two cars indeed as soon as raikkonen broke away from us he was able to lap considerably quicker but having said all that the rest of the weekend showed the improved pace of the r28 and the improvements that we have been making bit by bit over the last few races so the performance in hungary reinforces the belief that we are moving in the right direction and gives me confidence that we can finish fourth in the championship and end the season with the third fastest car
5644943 we look forward to every race and i think we like the challenge of a new circuit

5644954 that when he read black boy he was both pleased with it because it mirrored some of the things that happened to him and he was upset with it because he felt that wright had glamorized in a negative way some of his earlier upbringing
5644955 the first time i dropped out of school the counselors asked me what was wrong i wasnt going to tell some teacher that my mom is an alcoholic i wasnt going to do that
5644956 the kids were writing such negative stuff about themselves that i began to collect photographs to show how beautiful they actually were

5644980 mr lawson shakespeare described othello as a moor but theres no reason to believe that his actual skin color was black that probably would not have been acceptable in elizabethan england

5645022 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal

5645049 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5645050 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5645051 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5645052 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

5645060 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5645061 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5645077 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5645078 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5645079 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5645080 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5645081 mevrouw hier kunnen we niets meer voor u betekenen hoe spijtig het ook is

5645086 children are subjected to a lot of pro violence messages displayed by leaders who are icons of how to deal with conflict situations its a monkey see monkey do situation
5645087 when one looks at a child that commits such a crime one will find that the child has a lot of anger children do not know how to resolve conflicts and instead of being taught how to resolve disagreements they resort to violence
5645088 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5645089 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5645090 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5645091 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5645092 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5645093 is it what i want is it what i need is it the ultimate gift
5645094 know therefore that the lord your god is god he is the faithful god keeping his covenant of love for a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands
5645095 that anyone who believes in him may have eternal life
5645096 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god
5645097 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and discipline
5645098 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
5645099 which of you if his son asks for bread will give him a stone or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him
5645100 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5645101 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5645102 what is more i consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing christ jesus my lord for whose sake i have lost all things
5645103 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5645104 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5645105 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5645106 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5645107 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5645108 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5645109 and we who with unveiled faces all reflect the lords glory are being transformed into his likeness with ever increasing glory which comes from the lord who is the spirit
5645110 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5645111 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5645112 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5645113 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5645114 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5645115 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5645116 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5645117 who are open to doing something on the production side
5645118 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5645119 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5645120 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5645121 having to be someplace on time every day or have my attendance affect my final grade
5645122 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5645123 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5645124 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5645125 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5645126 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5645127 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5645128 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5645129 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5645130 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5645131 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5645132 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5645133 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5645134 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5645135 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5645136 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5645137 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5645138 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5645139 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5645140 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5645141 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5645142 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5645143 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5645144 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5645145 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5645146 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5645147 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

5645153 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

5645155 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5645156 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5645157 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5645158 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5645159 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5645160 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5645161 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford

5645179 we said georgia would eventually become a member of nato alongside ukraine and thats certainly the position that we will be advocating today
5645180 there is disproportional use of violence and we should send also a clear signal that the russian troops should withdraw but im convinced that we should also have the possibility for dialogue between nato and russia in the future
5645181 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want to this process to move faster
5645182 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5645183 all the time and effort and energy they spent all goes for naught and theyre going to have to start over if they are going to do anything or appeal
5645184 either way i think we are in a much much better position

5645440 the announcement comes as the home office publishes a strong new force at the border its strategy for ensuring the
5645441 the uk has one of the toughest borders in the world and we are determined to ensure it stays that way
5645442 i have not read the report yet so i can only answer on principle but i can imagine that there are many possibilities of tax evasion in many sectors
5645443 what i can say about forestry is that the commission in charge of setting the minimum export prices for timber has not met since 2000 so the logging companies took advantage of the situation to export timber at a price under its real value it means that the congolese government has suffered losses in terms of foreign currency earnings and taxes
5645444 for years greenpeace has been attempting to tarnish the reputation of danzer group by floating rumours making defamatory statements and spreading half truths but constantly repeating false concocted allegations does not make them true

5645450 michael felt people got too much credit for datasets already and that making them more widely citeable would actually devalue the contribution the example he cited was genome sequences this is a case where for historical reasons the publication of a dataset as a paper in a high ranking journal is considered appropriate in a sense i agree with this case the problem here is that for this specific case it is allowable to push a dataset sized peg into a paper sized hole this has arguably led to an over valuing of the sequence data itself and an undervaluing of the science it enables small molecule crystallography is similar in some regards with the publication of crystal structures in paper form bulking out the publication lists of many scientists there is a real sense in which having a publication stream for data making the data itself directly citeable would lead to a devaluation of these contributions on the other hand it would lead to a situation where you would cite what you used rather than the paper in which it was perhaps peripherally described i think more broadly that the publication of data will lead to greater efficiency in research generally and more diversity in the streams to which people can contribute
5645451 so to come back around to the original point the value of different forms of contribution is not due to the fact that they are non traditional or because of the medium per se it is because they are different

5645501 determining the degree of stenosis or how much the artery has narrowed is insufficient to predict patient risk
5645502 we know that the majority of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events occur in patients whose blood vessels are less than 70 percent narrowed

5645535 only in recent years has there been a substantial effort to manufacture child friendly formulations of first line tuberculosis drugs such as crushable mini pills granules oral suspensions
5645536 and in the past 15 years children have been included in only one study of new agents for tuberculosis a large phase 3 trial evaluating once weekly rifapentine isoniazid for treatment of latent tuberculosis
5645537 children have the same right to benefit from research as do adults
5645538 while this lack of involvement may be understandable in the short term it is not acceptable in the long term
5645539 we have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch

5645548 this study shows that number abilities are not simply based on culture or language associate professor reeve says
5645549 our findings are consistent with the idea that we have an innate system for representing quantity ideas and that the lack of number words in a language should not prevent us from completing simple number and computation tasks
5645550 we need to investigate ways in which we can add on to these building blocks to develop ways of teaching numeracy that are relevant to indigenous students culture he says
5645551 this study will potentially demonstrate that it is the regimen of administration of birth control pills rather than their specific formulation that results in successful treatment of pmdd
5645552 if we can eliminate the hormone cycling we should eliminate the pmdd symptoms
5645553 theyre regulators of mood and emotion so if you can eliminate the metabolites that have been implicated in pmdd you may create a huge benefit for women with pmdd
5645554 we believe this trial will help us understand the underlying physiology which will allow for the development of a range of possible new treatments
5645555 id gain weight my face would be puffy i had horrible cramps and that would get me mentally down the symptoms changed as i matured and had children it gradually became more emotional now it also affects my mental acuity and i can still get down sometimes
5645556 the impairment and reduction in quality of life for women with pmdd during their premenstrual phase is equivalent to people with major depression anxiety disorder and even post traumatic stress disorder
5645557 if we can show that continuous low dose contraceptives are effective that opens up another option that may have a better risk benefit profile than ssris
5645558 many women in our previous studies felt better knowing they were contributing to furthering our knowledge about this disorder and informing subsequent treatment options
5645559 we can give them a gold standard diagnosis if they do have pmdd and if they have something else we can help them find treatment for it
5645560 i know what to do and where to go i have all the information and i know help is there theres such a peace of mind from that
5645561 if you imagine a chessboard on which the dark squares are shrubs and the light squares are grasses warming alone would tend to increase the size of the dark squares until the chess board is completely filled in
5645562 our experiment suggests that herbivores like caribou and muskoxen will slow this process inhibit it or perhaps even increase the size of the white squares on the chessboard
5645563 this discovery is quite surprising considering that muskoxen occur at such a low density at our site
5645564 careful management and conservation of existing populations of muskoxen and caribou as well as other large herbivores should be a priority in plans to mitigate the effects of climate change on ecosystems
5645565 until now these animals seem to have been regarded more as background noise than as an active component of the ecosystems response to warming
5645566 our results suggest that herbivores in the arctic and elsewhere may constrain the increase in shrub growth that is projected by current models of global warming their grazing could have important consequences for the ability of shrubs to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide insect outbreaks may become more frequent with future warming as well and our results also suggest an important role of such outbreaks in reducing shrubs
5645567 on the practical and policy sides of this story we need to be aware that the carbon dioxide sponge represented especially by shrubs and trees may not be as big as we thought it was this finding is yet another reason to think carefully about reducing carbon dioxide emissions
5645568 its getting harder and harder to believe that these cells are immunoprivileged
5645569 in fact the rejection of these cells confirms our suspicions that they do cause an immune response
5645570 we all want to know whats going to happen if you transplant these stem cells into a person
5645571 based on these results we believe that transplanting these cells into humans would also cause an immune response
5645572 thats the beauty of this kind of noninvasive imaging system
5645573 it allows us to assess the response of one animal to a variety of conditions and gives us much more valuable information
5645574 this is a lifestyle product that will also prove invaluable for those doing online learning e commerce shopping or watching movies or sports at home
5645575 the speed is constant affording users convenience of internet connection at all times
5645576 with the guaranteed high speed connection users will be able to reach entertainment sites such as e bay more easily to buy books or music watch films catch up with the latest news and other activities
5645577 i foresee a greater subscription for online usage here than in the west where it is seen as an alternative as opposed to in kenya where it serves a real need
5645578 this is the first study to comprehensively look at a large population of infected persons to study the long term effects of west nile virus
5645579 we found that both physical and mental functions as well as mood and fatigue seemed to return to normal in about one year
5645580 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5645581 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5645582 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5645583 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5645584 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5645585 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5645586 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5645587 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5645588 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5645589 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5645590 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response
5645591 but it fails at the end because drug resistance develops
5645592 this pathogen has spread to all the oceans of the world and is resistant to many antibiotics
5645593 no one has seen such a rapid triggering of autophagy before
5645594 treating the human cells with an autophagy inhibitor halted the protein breakdown process but did not save the cells because v para uses other pathways by which to kill cells
5645595 however because it can kill by several routes its important to understand all of them
5645596 weve received a wake up call that this is important environmentally and we want to understand at the molecular level how this pathogen infects kills and persists
5645597 there are people getting sick from this emerging pathogen in the united states yet there is no major effort to understand its pathology
5645598 there are many ways to kill a cell and weve discovered yet another one the bacterium hijacks activities from us and deregulates them its like a bulldozer
5645599 this is the first study that shows the contribution of ships to fine particulates in the atmosphere
5645600 ships are really unregulated when it comes to air pollution standards what we wanted to find out was the contribution of ships to the air pollution in san diego and what we found was a surprise because no one expected that the contribution from ships of solid sulfur rich particles called primary sulfate would be so high
5645601 the importance of primary sulfate is usually ignored in assessments of the impact of ship emissions on air quality because less than 7 percent of all sulfur emitted by ships is found in primary sulfate particles
5645602 but our results suggest that this component of ship emissions is important and should not be ignored in the future knowing how much sulfate from ships is in the air will also allow us to better understand what happens to the other 93 percent of sulfur emitted by ships
5645603 we found that in san diego the port of los angeles can be a significant influence on air quality because these fine particulates can travel so far
5645604 you cannot just sit back and do nothing in this kind of situation because if you dont you make losses
5645605 you have to be realistic and decide whether you are going to fly a 100 seat aircraft at a loss for the sake of it or do the right thing and protect the company
5645606 i think kenya airways can offer us capacity and we can offer them capacity which would be good for everybody
5645607 accelerating growth and network expansion makes sense in our situation because carrying more passengers would put us in a better position to deal with our fixed costs
5645608 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5645609 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5645610 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5645611 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5645612 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5645613 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5645614 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles
5645615 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5645616 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5645617 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5645618 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5645619 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5645620 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5645621 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5645622 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5645623 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5645624 politicians are the lowest form of life on earth liberal democrats are the lowest form of politician
5645625 hac a 41 grados al sol eran las peores condiciones posibles para l
5645626 we believe that this is not only an innovative but a sustainable tariff scheme that is going to be around for a very long time because it transcends the current promotional tariffs that restrict savings to particular windows of the day with mtn zone callers can enjoy savings all day long depending on network usage
5645627 lignin is natures plastic and any organism that wants to get to the sugars in a plant has to be able to get past this protective barrier
5645628 we suspect that the fungus produces enzymes that help the beetles degrade lignin
5645629 how these insects are able to circumvent this plastic wall lignin and get at the goodies the sugars behind it has remained a mystery
5645630 we have been able to detect messages from the fungal dna which get translated into enzymes
5645631 the types of chemical changes we see in the beetle are similar to those seen in the white rot fungus
5645632 changes that we see in the termite are similar to those in the brown rot fungus the chemical changes to the lignin are similar
5645633 it is likely that there is an interaction among enzymes produced by the fungus hundreds of bacteria within the insect gut and the insect itself
5645634 this type of fungus in the asian longhorned beetle is known to cause disease in plants
5645635 but this particular strain appears to be unique it looks like these insects somehow acquired the fungus to live in their gut and help them break down wood
5645636 getting rid of the lignin barrier and making the cellulose more accessible is the most expensive and environmentally unfriendly part of making ethanol from biomass
5645637 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5645638 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5645639 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5645640 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5645641 the holy grail of enzyme catalysis and the ultimate manifestation of understanding of this process is the ability to design enzymes
5645642 what really fits is the electrostatic interaction between the enzyme active site to the substrate charges at the so called transition state where the bonds are halfway to being broken
5645643 previous research has suggested that its not individual hiv viruses that get into the brain but rather hiv infected immune cells known as monocytes
5645644 using an animal model we wanted to find out first of all whether being infected with hiv enables monocytes to do what they dont usually do escape from blood vessels and enter brain tissue
5645645 these results demonstrated very clearly that being infected with hiv somehow gives monocytes the capacity to cross an intact bbb
5645646 but we also suspected that something else was making it easier for hiv infected monocytes to breach the defenses protecting the brain from infection
5645647 so we hypothesized that the combination of hiv infected monocytes and elevated lps levels would amplify the ability of hiv to cross the bbb and get into the brain
5645648 clearly hiv infected monocytes uniquely benefit from the lps that is present in high amounts in the blood of hiv infected people
5645649 so when hiv infected monocytes are knocking on the door of the bbb and starting to crack it open the lps facilitates their entry by making the bbb more permeable apparently by weakening blood vessel structure
5645650 these results demonstrate very dramatically that hiv infection of cells associated with the bbb in conjunction with lps exposure contributes to bbb breakdown
5645651 so when hiv infection occurs we seem to have a 1 2 3 combination of punches working in concert to facilitate entry of hiv infected monocytes into the bbb protected brain hiv infection of monocytes increases their capacity to cross even an intact bbb hiv infection in the gut releases lps into the bloodstream allowing it to erode the bbb and hiv infection of the cells of the bbb makes them more sensitive to the deleterious effects of lps
5645652 we may be able to use antibiotics that kill intestinal bacteria that make lps and drugs are already available that can bind to lps and clear it from the bloodstream
5645653 ideally we would promptly start newly diagnosed hiv infected patients on a treatment to reinforce their bbbs so that hiv cant penetrate it and perhaps we could even strengthen the bbbs of people whove been infected for quite a while but before we can prevent the tragedy of hiv associated dementia we need to better understand the mechanism by which these molecular and cellular punches interact to undermine the bbb
5645654 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5645655 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5645656 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons
5645657 using the 3 d representations we are comparing the brain structures of autistic children to those of non autistic children no one has ever done that
5645658 our research group is exploiting a tremendous overlap of knowledge from many disciplines yes work will be a pivotal part of anrgs grand scheme
5645659 to solve these problems it takes an entire community of specialists working together
5645660 we introduce a way to relate wind stretch to dry air and dust which correlate very well with humidity in the western tropical atlantic
5645661 the index we proposed may provide practical implications for the prediction of atlantic hurricane activities
5645662 further studies are needed to discern the general prediction capability of our results

5645664 my mother has end stage leukaemia and we had to get a carer in who worked for the primary care trust pct
5645665 the next day my mum said 40 had gone out of her purse
5645666 emma wrote down the serial numbers on three 20 notes in my mums purse and we got a 55 camera from the local diy store
5645667 emma said the camera lens was just like the eye of the teddy bear in the house so we put the camera inside
5645668 we thought it would be a long process but she was greedy
5645669 we called the police and showed them the footage and gave them the serial numbers
5645670 she thelma has seen justice before she dies she was glad to hear the sentence
5645671 we can confirm that a former health care assistant employed by the provider arm of liverpool primary care trust has been arrested and convicted of stealing from a patient
5645672 liverpool primary care trust has fully supported merseyside police in this investigation and the member of staff involved was immediately suspended following their arrest
5645673 our inflation figures are way above that but what it tells us is that the productive base of the economy has really shrunk we really need to change the way we do business
5645674 what is needed is significant inflows of foreign currency policy consistency and structural reforms in the energy sector
5645675 we should pay special attention to the anti terrorist protection of key infrastructure sites
5645676 the russians are looking for a pretext to extend the occupation both in time and space
5645677 i didnt see any tanks or armoured personnel carriers leaving the conflict zone
5645678 prevent weapons smuggling and members of foreign terrorist organisations from entering russia
5645679 i hope the world has woken up to what is going on the russians should get out of my country
5645680 the worst thing the world could do would be to compromise and show weakness
5645681 the russians will invent all kinds of excuses pretexts not to pull back their troops
5645682 they will rename themselves peacekeepers maintain their positions in the security zone
5645683 determining what the priorities should be is not difficult militancy the economy and relations with india and afghanistan need to be addressed urgently
5645684 solutions however may prove more elusive but at the very least the politicians must show the same purpose and focus in dealing with the problems that they have demonstrated in taking on the president
5645685 the coalition must quickly nominate and elect a joint candidate as president and avoid lengthy political bargaining
5645686 it is time for the elected government to show people their ballots were not wasted
5645687 the coalition partners must demonstrate they are capable of insightful leadership political wisdom and can live up to the task of guiding the country with musharraf gone they no longer have an excuse for failure
5645688 the coalition has won an important battle so it has to work on an emergency basis to resolve the economic crisis and the announcement of a relief package for the people should be a government priority
5645689 his legacy is undeniably there and the good that he did must stand even though this is too emotional and passionate a moment to dwell on it with any degree of objectivity
5645690 helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene
5645691 three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests isaf forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests there were no isaf casualties in the attack
5645692 their time is up and they move into the hands of the state
5645693 but no private interest can be above the interests of the people

5646257 pei has long been an industry leader in providing professional tax preparers with the tools they need to efficiently process tax returns for their customers integrating support for electronic signature pads meets the needs of our customers who are looking to move toward a paperless return

5646263 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
5646264 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
5646265 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
5646266 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
5646267 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
5646268 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
5646269 reported consumer inflation continued to surge on both a monthly and annual basis once again topping consensus expectations the july cpi u jumped to a 17 year high of 5 6 in july while annual inflation for the narrower cpi w targeted at the wage earners category where gasoline takes a bigger proportionate bite out of spending annual inflation jumped to 6 2 the cpi w is used for making the annual cost of living adjustments to social security payments the 2009 adjustment based on the july to september 2008 period remains a good bet to top 5 more than double last years 2 3 adjustment for 2008 such is not good news for federal budget deficit projections

5646286 in the last couple of years i thought that it was slipping away
5646287 but i think that this team has answered a lot of questions anything that was thrown at us against tipp we had the answers
5646288 i am happy to be in an all ireland final now we are just so pleased
5646289 we have always wanted to give our fans a day out in an all ireland final and it was more for them really than the players for the whole of waterford really
5646290 we may have clicked against tipp but we mustnt forget that we are up against an awesome team in kilkenny and their manager brian cody
5646291 kilkenny were without a game for five weeks and they came up and cork stayed with them for 20 minutes and there was just pure class all over the field they had no excuses
5646292 they are going to be a hard team to beat but please god we will turn up on the day and it will be a good final

5646298 free radicals from tobacco smoke have long been suspected of having extremely harmful effects on the body
5646299 based on our work we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all of diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5646300 you basically have to be in certain places to inhale transient gas phase radicals
5646301 youd have to be right next to a road when a car passes for example whereas we found that persistent radicals can last indefinitely on airborne fine particles so youre never going to get away from them
5646302 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
5646303 and i also feel that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5646304 that does not mean we exclude people from our party who are pro choice
5646305 not do anything that would be disruptive to what has been very important to the republican platform
5646306 end mccains bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
5646307 some people in the movement say it would be a kiss of death
5646308 the point that mccain was making is that people can differ on one issue and still be a vital member of our party
5646309 the fact that governor ridge is not perfectly in line with the party platform does not make him any less of a republican
5646310 pro choice americans know that this flip flop is not indicative of a policy shift or a reverse course for the anti choice and anti birth control mccain it is clear that mccain is nervous about his diminishing support among independent women a key voting bloc that will likely determine the outcome of this election mccain knows he needs pro choice independent and republican women to win in november but his extreme position on a womans right to choose makes it increasingly difficult to attract these voters
5646311 it is unbelievable how life is so unpredictable and finds a way to distract and derail you from your plans my prayers are with jade her family in this hour when they face one of the biggest tests of their life in times ahead
5646312 i pray she comes out of this soon and stronger hope that she is going back with happy memories from this country
5646313 we are shocked to hear this unfortunate news jade has been very brave in the face of such a difficult situation and we are extending all possible support that she requires at this stage our prayers are with her
5646314 creativity is not like a freight train going down the tracks

5646321 they are no longer a big draw in the west as star prices have multiplied five times and promoters like us cannot afford them shows now work only if the star is producing the show
5646322 it is true that star prices have increased for live shows
5646323 it is definitely true that this is more of brand promotion of an actor today

5646331 the actual figure for july can be much high as 300 million per cent while for august it could be 600 million per cent
5646332 zimbabweans must realise that the country is in a practically binding state of socio economic emergency

5646338 irgendwie scheint alles leichter einfacher sch ner im sommer wenn es warm ist wenn die sonne scheint liegt das wirklich nur am wetter oder liegt es an uns an dem was wir machen an den perfekten tagen
5646339 im only in the bill until october then its finished
5646340 as yet i dont know what i am going to do next
5646341 she has chosen not to renew her contract when it ends later this year
5646342 louisa has decided to move on after two years to try new things
5646343 that juicy pout hour glass figure thick gorgeous hair and brad on her arm to me as someone whos not that curvy its bizarre to think any girl would aspire to be really thin guys dont find it attractive
5646344 so the producers said they wanted to give me another chance when i got the phone call i was crying tears of joy out of my living room window it was nine years ago since i last walked the cobbles so ive been lost at sea for that long
5646345 it was like finding my way back to the land of milk and honey i couldnt believe it im delighted to be back though
5646346 i didnt treat it as the golden opportunity that it was i lost my mum and basically i lost the plot
5646347 i was on the ale not paying attention and not being utterly professional its one of britains top soaps and to be called to play on that stage its on a par with being asked to play for england and you should really honour it have the commitment and give it everything youve got im 54 now and im never going to look a gift horse in the mouth again
5646348 i got carried away with myself i had to re audition for the part of jackie they wanted to see for themselves that i was on fighting form
5646349 they had the script ready for jackie dobbs but they sent me the script for auntie pam
5646350 its an absolute disgrace these stars have given their heart and soul to
5646351 bettys nearly 90 eileen and barbara are in their seventies and malcolm hebden is 68 instead of being rewarded for their contribution they are being treated little better than extras
5646352 i was apprehensive about undressing but then i thought its not sexual im not trying to seduce anyone and the comedy actress in me knew it would be warm and funny
5646353 also im not doing it alone although i do have to do it more than the others ill have to work the magic for the women in the audience i want them to feel theyre living it with me
5646354 skol uma marca greg ria para dividir com amigos e nada melhor do que uma cerveja de 1 litro para ocasi es como churrascos e festas por isso decidimos atender esta demanda oferecendo aos consumidores uma embalagem mais econ mica de 1 litro retorn vel
5646355 is the only way we can be the change that we want to see
5646356 if the freshmen and women want to be the change that they want to see they should be serious with their academic work and go beyond classroom work to acquire more knowledge in order to cause the change that they want to see
5646357 if nobody believes in you you will surely succeed but if you do not believe in yourself then you are bound to fail so believe in your capabilities and abilities
5646358 ghanaians and foreigners who are contributing to ict development in diverse ways need to be commended and their experiences shared with the young through these media
5646359 despite these massive investments in ict infrastructure and ict capacity building ghana still to a large extent is digitally isolated from the global village because it lacks critical drive and strategies to harness the full potential for the socio economic development of the country
5646360 i am happy just to be alive after the injury i was complaining of asthma after surgery last year but it was not that i missed an injection and blood went into my lungs football was not the most important thing i nearly lost my life
5646361 sometimes when things happen you can be knocked off if you are not strong mentally but i am strong mentally and i never give up which is why i am still going strong
5646362 i have been so worried that i can hardly watch football i wish so often that i am on the field but i dont brood over some things i know when the time is right i will enjoy my football again there are ups and downs the most important thing is not to give up because i have given it my all to be able to come back
5646363 stephen can play again but when i will return will remain a surprise i dont want to rush the comeback i want everything to be gradual i have been out for one year and i understand it will take time to get my rhythm back
5646364 i have been in italy training for about a month now
5646365 everything is going well and very soon you will see me again on the football field
5646366 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind
5646367 this is not the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs or cause the type of damage we normally see in a large hurricane
5646368 ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetrical storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous
5646369 we just want to make sure its not a problem
5646370 the area to which you are planning to sail is the subject of an advisory notice which warns all foreign vessels to remain clear of the designated maritime zone
5646371 we assume that your intentions are good but in fact the result of your action is that you are supporting the regime of a terrorist organisation in

5646374 we want a true party man with some level of loyalty choosing a compromise candidate will dampen the spirit and discourage party members who have sacrificed their lives for the party
5646375 dr bawumia is not the presidential candidate he is just a running mate so we are not much worried about him
5646376 i would have run him a lot more than kansas did
5646377 pirates or patriots the private wars of capt john paul jones and col john langdon
5646378 hes gotten to where directors think of him when theyre reading a script
5646379 its on the ocean just before it becomes canada real down east maine it was the poorest county in the u s when i grew up poor but good people it isnt like there was any crime or anything its just no one had any money
5646380 he asked me one day if you lived in a world where there wasnt any money
5646381 i thought id at least pull in and ask them about it i wasnt planning on auditioning
5646382 they said are you here to audition i said im just here to see whats going on they said do you have an irish accent i said do i need one they said yeah just go down there and audition so i just went down on stage and probably did a horrible lucky charms thing and got the part
5646383 its a smallish community and you meet wonderful people involved with other theaters last year i did seven shows this year theres been six
5646384 the trade off is if you take a theater role you cant audition most contracts are for four to six weeks you may have an audition date you can get to but they may have tentative shoot dates you may not be able to go to so do you take theater and lose a month and a half or not and hope a better paying job comes though print of film you never know
5646385 people go to new york hoping for their break and theyre miserable i would rather live happily get paid what you do here for seven shows than do one in new york for that money and live where you dont love for the rest of the year
5646386 its too tough to do this with any bit of guilt
5646387 the addition of this dramatically designed sport wagon is well synchronized with todays changing consumer tastes as a compelling alternative to suvs or other larger vehicles
5646388 this is an important step in cadillacs ongoing global expansion and of course in international markets like europe wagons have been and continue to be very significant
5646389 the cts sport wagon is an important expansion to the cadillac lineup worldwide
5646390 its a taut design that not only suggests sleekness but delivers it
5646391 indeed the drama of the sedan is amplified in the cts sport wagon as the centerline cue that is part of the exterior and interior is more prominent and plays a stronger role in defining the design at the rear of the vehicle
5646392 the more you study the rear of the cts sport wagon the more you see
5646393 functionality was certainly a guiding factor during development but so was the idea to inject emotion into the normally sedate wagon category
5646394 theyre not fins in the classic sense but they work to help disguise the cargo load system and yes they acknowledge cadillacs design heritage

5646413 we did invite two prominent saudi bloggers to our global voices summit 2008

5646415 a long list of powerful companies have tried and failed to make much of a mark in the world of digital entertainment where apple reigns supreme
5646416 this is all about apple this is about dell not having ipod itunes and losing consumer pc sales to macs because of it
5646417 we dont have an ipod killer because the only true ipod killer is the next generation ipod as for zing we have allowed ourselves to be deluded once again by outside influences including failed moto execs and quote for hire charlatans well blow huge chunks of cash and other things on this investors should be massing with pitchforks but since i brought this company into the world theyll stand idly by and let me take it out too
5646418 if youll recall from our q1 earnings results our consumer business is doing pretty well
5646419 michael dell is doing exactly what all others are doing skating where the puck is
5646420 right now our focus is on testing services that allow consumers to link and share content across many types of devices and through multiple services
5646421 they are doing a great job evolving our consumer strategy and driving personalized technology and entertainment experiences to consumers
5646422 they are indeed skating to where the puck is no longer
5646423 tough shit vista is the most advanced operating system weve ever made and you are going to like it
5646424 tough shit were discontinuing xp sales in favor of vista
5646425 apple is hitting the puck not only are they hitting the puck they are defining where the goal is

5646428 a livecd focused on web application testing we have collected the top testing tools and pre installed them to build the perfect environment for testing applications
5646429 it is the board s responsibility placed on it by the government to provide information for people mainly parents with young children
5646430 i think part of the problem is that the bbfc is an industry body rather than a public body
5646431 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5646432 we saw a lot of misinformation out there you have people who only hear one sides take on an issue one that isnt necessarily right from a legal standpoint we created the legality as a way to explain the legal matters behind popular events

5646436 estamos convencidos que la prevenci n es la mejor herramienta para lograr bajar los niveles delictuales en los que nos vemos afectados

5646456 a developer who does not understand the kernel communitys ways or worse who tries to flout or circumvent them will have a frustrating experience in store
5646457 much developer frustration comes from a lack of understanding of this process or from attempts to circumvent it
5646458 the bigger and more important the project the more likely it is to have a number of levels
5646459 enterprise class projects including the linux kernel have more processes but that shows how seriously they take the project its less difficult to get code into a project if you understand the rules

5646487 desde mi punto de vista esta descomposici n social viene de lejos se acentu en los ltimos tiempos y se precipit despu s del fraude electoral el fraude caus un da o inmenso lastim los sentimientos de millones de mexicanos socav las instituciones envileci por entero la llamada sociedad pol tica y quien actualmente se ostenta como presidente de la rep blica no s lo carece de autoridad moral sino que su ineptitud es cada vez m s evidente

5646489 for one thing the kernel is quite complex and big and it inevitably simply takes time to learn all the rules not just for the code but for how the whole development environment works similarly for a new developer it will take time before people start recognising the name and start trusting the developer to do the right things
5646490 we make it fairly easy for people to ease into kernel development
5646491 it seems to be working too we literally have thousands of people with patches attributed to them in each release
5646492 the worst thing anybody can do is to study the kernel alone and try to learn things in private and then however many months later present all the established kernel developers with a big patch that just comes out of the blue
5646493 it may not sound exciting but quite frankly i dont think anybody who starts out believing that they want to rewrite some big piece of the kernel should even bother reality isnt that simple
5646494 of course some people will be alienated and theres no doubt that the process could probably be improved
5646495 not a warm and fuzzy environment where people sing kumbaya around the fireplace
5646496 the kernel is about pretty harsh technical issues and mistakes are really frowned upon
5646497 in an os kernel there are simply more security and stability requirements and the bar is really higher in some respects that will inevitably also reflect in the response to patches
5646498 i think that one of the things weve been very good at is to scale up with a good network of maintainers so that most people involved actually dont work closely with more than a handful of people
5646499 normally the people you find at the core of open source projects are professional software engineers these guys know how to run software projects

5646511 his personal involvement is crucial to being an effective mayor and to ensure appropriate democratic accountability to the people of london
5646512 london has not lost the services of tim parker he has completed the first stages of the glas restructuring and we will continue to benefit from his advice im also personally grateful to him for his continuing support and friendship
5646513 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5646514 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5646515 i wont vote for obama but im not sure what ill do
5646516 he was just waking up to the thought that women around the country were upset over the treatment of hillary

5646519 america is being overrun by an invasion force from mexico thatll soon take over the country
5646520 if you look at the countries around the world where most of these immigrants have come from you will see autocratic regimes you will see drug dealers running the nation you will see people living like serfs and you will see the future face of america
5646521 and you think the gang banger with baggy pants is going to pay for your retirement you liberal fools you think that theyre going to pay for your housing in a senior citizens center you psychotic liberals dont even know youre digging your own grave and throwing lime in there all thats missing is the worm from the tequila bottle to go with it
5646522 w e need to get our troops out of iraq and put them on the streets of america to protect us from the scourge of illegal immigrants who are running rampant across america killing our police for sport raping murdering like a scythe across america while the liberal psychos are telling us they come here to work
5646523 were getting refugees now who have never used a telephone a toothbrush or toilet paper youre telling me theyre going to assimilate they will never assimilate they come here and they bring their destitute ways to this country and they never assimilate
5646524 and then their children become gang bangers it is a disaster did you hear what i just said a disaster
5646525 we have to adapt medicine for the times and at this point where we have an uncontrolled unabated hiv epidemic worldwide then i do promote circumcision
5646526 cleanliness also seems to be a problem with uncircumcised men because of the ability of the foreskin to harbour bacteria and smells
5646527 the us still has very high rates of circumcision as well as extremely high rates of hiv aids

5646640 pakistan civilian leaders should now move quickly to challenge the taliban and al qaeda which threaten its own stability
5646641 the first challenge is to choose a new civilian president free from any taint of corruption or complicity with past dictatorships the presidency must also be stripped of the special dictatorial powers that musharraf seized for himself including the power to suspend civil liberties and rule by decree

5646659 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
5646660 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5646661 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5646662 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5646663 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5646664 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic
5646665 although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically

5646732 the demand for mini notebooks will be driven by several factors by their small form factor and small screen their light weight their price their ease of use and their basic but sufficient pc functionality
5646733 mini notebooks are likely to attract a variety of users with different usage scenarios content consumption internet browsing e mail instant messaging im keeping in touch with friends and family storing and sharing pictures and so on potential users are likely to include both first time buyers seeking a low cost introductory pc as well as experienced users seeking a low cost second or third pc for themselves or a relative
5646734 mini notebooks create opportunities to reach some new pc buyers and expand within existing buyers across all regions
5646735 considering the majority of mini notebooks will be sold to consumers pc vendors will need to pay increasing attention to the design and ease of use of mini notebooks these will be two crucial factors in this segment
5646736 for consumer mini notebooks to succeed they need to be positioned differently than standard notebooks and pc vendors will need to decide if the existing channels to market are appropriate and possibly look for new channels such as telecom gadget shops and so on
5646737 pc vendors will have to convince retailers to take on those products as they are still emerging products and potentially present some risk from an inventory point of view

5646758 what a waste of time we already have schools why a christian school why shut off christian kids from the rest of the world in a little ghetto why take christian teachers out of state schools where they can be salt and light why waste precious resources that could be used for evangelism
5646759 youre home educating really thats very brave how long are you going to do it for
5646760 are they keeping up academically with other children their age
5646761 youre putting your children in the hands of unbelievers for 6 hours a day five days a week where you have no control over what theyre taught really thats very brave how long are you going to do it for right up to the age of 18 i really admire you i wish i had your courage
5646762 in a world where jesus is lord and all reality holds together in him youre letting your children learn from people who dont even acknowledge he exists or if they do dont think that should make any difference to their education so why are you doing that
5646763 your young impressionable children are mixing with all those non christian kids who tell them that believing in god is silly and who are absorbing the messages of our culture that money and possessions and fornication and sodomy and self centred pleasure seeking and petty vindictiveness are all perfectly normal ways of life dont you worry about their socialization
5646764 how are they doing academically have they learned to read and write yet or are their teachers happy to let them wait till secondary school for that
5646765 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
5646766 i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5646767 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
5646768 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
5646769 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
5646770 to lose one advisor is unfortunate to lose two is careless but to lose three in four months shows the wheels are coming off this new administration

5646777 the truth is that gordon browns old fashioned leftist idea that only the state can guarantee fairness has led to a decade of top down state control policies that have made our country less fair browns labour means an unfair britain

5646801 nothing will drastically change ahead of the weekend but we will be urging the players to be more ruthless if you are a striker one on one with the opposition you should score if your a centre half you should be heading a stray ball away it is simple as that
5646802 it was a good performance against workington but it could have been miles better to go all that way and come back with a point when we should have won is disappointing but we will get over it
5646803 we could have had a perfect start to the season but it has not happened thats football but maybe farsley should have come away from marston road on the opening day with a point

5646824 i have played three times since last years opening of the new wembley but this will be different atmosphere during international games is different in england
5646825 since i came here ive played as a winger but i will do what the manager wants me to do
5646826 i played most of my career as a winger but i have played as a striker before
5646827 i want to play and i want to be part of the team so it doesnt matter where i play the manager said i have something he likes as a striker so i have to keep showing him why i should be picked
5646828 i will keep trying and when i get the chances i will try to score some goals
5646829 i havent set any specific targets for this season but my aim is just to play as much as possible
5646830 it was explained to me that because i had been out for four months with injury that the national coach wanted to see me back in action
5646831 the fact that i am in the under 21s will not affect my game and i aim to make sure it will not be long before i am in the senior squad hopefully i will be back with the big boys again very soon
5646832 there are a lot of good players available to the england manager but if he had been at villa he would have seen an outstanding performance from micah

5646843 if the footage shows any acts of misconduct that were perhaps missed by the match officials we will deal with it
5646844 the footage would have to be clear cut but there have been incidences in the past when players were banned on the strength of video evidence
5646845 tommy is a young lad but he has a responsibility to the club to his team mates and to himself this game is hard enough when it is 11 against 11 but i dont want to take the physical enthusiastic side of tommys game away from him
5646846 it was his first game we had a great support there and the lad was desperate to do well
5646847 he came on and he did really well he was very unlucky with his header as the goalkeeper made a great save he made a great tackle after running across the motherwell defence then he got involved in some silly things for which he was booked
5646848 ive had a word with tommy and told him he has to channel his aggression
5646849 if he misses games his bank balance will take a knock and he will miss games he is here to play and he has to give himself a chance
5646850 zander felt a tightness in his thigh and didnt want to take any risks
5646851 luckily enough it is not his ankle but it is still a blow to be without him
5646852 he came off at the right time and hasnt made the injury any worse hopefully he should be back following the international break
5646853 i am there a long time i thought last year coming in was probably my last year
5646854 in the last couple of years i thought that it was slipping away
5646855 but i think that this team has answered a lot of questions anything that was thrown at us against tipp we had the answers
5646856 i am happy to be in an all ireland final now we are just so pleased
5646857 we have always wanted to give our fans a day out in an all ireland final and it was more for them really than the players for the whole of waterford really
5646858 we may have clicked against tipp but we mustnt forget that we are up against an awesome team in kilkenny and their manager brian cody
5646859 kilkenny were without a game for five weeks and they came up and cork stayed with them for 20 minutes and there was just pure class all over the field they had no excuses
5646860 they are going to be a hard team to beat but please god we will turn up on the day and it will be a good final

5646881 the main thing im hoping for three weeks away from the semis is that we dont continually limp our way through the next three weeks and struggle when we get there
5646882 to be so good for 20 weeks it would be a shame now to undo all that as it would for the roosters
5646883 were both struggling a bit i think we spoke about five weeks ago about geez were in a good position could be top four and since then weve struggled a bit
5646884 they were brilliant for the first 12 14 weeks and maybe both of us have hit the wall
5646885 three weeks out its time to get some red cordial and have some coffee and do whatever you can to get a bit excited
5646886 we have to stand up and win games big games on the big stage and unfortunately weve let ourselves down in games like manly and brisbane
5646887 we just have to learn to handle it if were going to go good in the semi finals
5646888 unfortunately theres only a few of us who have played semi final football
5646889 the build up to the manly game had a semi final feel about it and maybe shellshocked a few of the boys so hopefully were a little bit more used to it now and we can handle it a bit better this week
5646890 its a black and white answer or should i say a black green and yellow answer
5646891 clean coal renewables and yellowcake we must include nuclear in our future baseload clean energy mix
5646892 burying mere tonnes of radioactive waste in geological stable rock
5646893 our view is that there needs to be consideration in australia given to the development of a nuclear power industry
5646894 we need more rational discussion about nuclear power in australia and much less of the emotive political debate weve had in the last few years
5646895 we havent changed too much from last year we lost a couple of big players in timana tahu and timmy smith but weve still got the core of the team there
5646896 we were one step away from the grand final last year and i still believe we can go all the way
5646897 a lot of people are writing us off now and everyone thinks the seasons been a big disappointment but if we get there were a big chance we might scare a few teams
5646898 i wouldnt be jumping out of our skin if i was them thinking that theyre back
5646899 no not at all you cant just come out and play like that one week and go back into your shell
5646900 he coach michael hagan has got one of the best rosters in the competition there in parramatta and theyre underachieving

5646936 senator biden the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee clearly fell into the category of helping mr obama on foreign policy while mr kaine is a relative newcomer to national politics and would reinforce the notion of change both mr kaine and mr bayh would help mr obama in a state that democrats are trying to put in play
5646937 biden who travelled to georgia this weekend at the behest of president mikhail saakashvili would be seen by many as a solid choice for obama on foreign policy he hasnt hesitated to launch sharp attacks on john mccain and he has a record of making prescient comments about pakistan among other issues
5646938 it may or may not be a coincidence that tim kaine and evan bayh appeared on sunday news programmes further stoking the kaine flame obama is scheduled to campaign in virginia on thursday
5646939 but the most curious recent development was sen joseph biden jrs trip to georgia this weekend obama campaign officials said the fact finding mission wasnt their idea but they did confirm discussing it in advance with bidens office

5646943 in summer we live out of doors and have only impulses and feelings which are all for action and must wait commonly for the stillness and longer nights of autumn and winter before any thought will subside we are sensible that behind the rustling leaves and the stacks of grain and the bare clusters of the grape there is the field of a wholly new life which no man has lived that even this earth was made for more mysterious and nobler inhabitants than men and women in the hues of october sunsets we see the portals to other mansions than those which we occupy
5646944 all the time and effort and energy they spent all goes for naught and theyre going to have to start over if they are going to do anything or appeal
5646945 either way i think we are in a much much better position
5646946 of any mechanism where this city can purge itself of wrongdoing

5646953 we are confident that this partnership will prove beneficial in contributing to showcase the best in new and independent music at the 2009 festival
5646954 het is aardig om krachtige taal uit te slaan maar uiteindelijk zijn het toch de amerikanen en niet de polen die op grond van artikel 5 van het navo handvest georgi dan militair moeten bijstaan
5646955 in oekraine zit natuurlijk ook een grote russische minderheid in het oostelijk deel van de oekra ne maar vooral ook op de krim waar de thuisbasis van de zwarte zee vloot is het is niet ondenkbaar dat de russen zullen zeggen we gaan ook die russische minderheid beschermen
5646956 kiev en moskou zullen hun meningsverschillen vooral onderling moeten oplossen de navo en de eu kunnen in deze weinig doen
5646957 ich kann nicht besser werden ich habe noch so viele andere dinge die ich in meinem leben machen m chte und deswegen h re ich auf

5646985 zwei jahre stillstand sind genug wir brauchen entschlossenes handeln der politik der geb udesektor kann enorm zum klimaschutz beitragen aber die rechtlichen und finanziellen rahmenbedingungen m ssen stimmen
5646986 der bau ist einer der stabilsten sektoren der sterreichischen wirtschaft wir brauchen eine sanierungsoffensive zur sicherung qualitativ hochwertiger arbeitspl tze eine sanierungsoffensive bei eigenheimen bedeutet nicht nur einen massiven beitrag zum klimaschutz sondern schafft arbeitspl tze gerade auch im l ndlichen raum
5646987 die kyoto ziele sind eine v lkerrechtliche verpflichtung sterreich kommt um kompensationszahlungen mit sicherheit nicht herum unsere nicht gemachten hausaufgaben sind teuer zu bezahlen
5646988 die instrumente liegen umsetzungsreif vor es liegt am gesetzgeber den geeigneten instrumentenmix zu definieren es bestehen unterschiedliche optionen nur die eine option ist unzul ssig sich wie bisher vor einer entscheidung zu dr cken
5646989 denn die gute wohnversorgung in sterreich ist vor allem auf kontinuit t im neubau zur ck zu f hren
5646990 weve got various different ideas i think all the leads on the team all have their own idea what the demo should be and it obviously makes sense for the demo to happen before the game ships we all feel that its essential because the game is so different
5646991 there were four challenges in the e3 demo in banjo land and that worked well so the idea would be that and then wed have some form of the editor in there as well because thats a whole different part of the game building things and seeing how they perform and taking part in challenges
5646992 the way stop n swop was meant to work originally was that theres parts in the original banjo that werent unlocked until the original banjo realised youd been playing the sequel which we had to change because of the evolution of the hardware of the n64 it wouldve worked on early n64s but not the later ones
5646993 so thats why we never actually released it it was my job to actually finish it off so you cant imagine how many fans hate me because of that so what were doing now is literally the same thing so there is unlockables in both games that are accessible once both games realise youve been playing the other one
5646994 no that in turn unlocks bits that you can use and so forth i think thats about as far as im allowed to go
5646995 we said georgia would eventually become a member of nato alongside ukraine and thats certainly the position that we will be advocating today
5646996 there is disproportional use of violence and we should send also a clear signal that the russian troops should withdraw but im convinced that we should also have the possibility for dialogue between nato and russia in the future
5646997 there are different sensibilities on this there are states who want to this process to move faster
5646998 the alliance has to take united firm position but without being aggressive
5646999 annihilate the sparrow that stealer of seed and our harvests will be around we will watch our wealth flood in
5647000 rather nonchalantly used his sandaled foot to draw a cross in the dirt
5647001 i do question if john mccain has in a mix up of perception or clarity claimed this story as his own
5647002 this is a major public health concern that should be given serious consideration in future urban development transportation planning and environmental policies
5647003 health risk can be mitigated through proper urban planning but that doesnt erase the immediate risk to school age children attending schools that are too close to highways right now
5647004 existing schools should be retrofitted with air filtration systems that will reduce students exposure to traffic pollutants
5647005 for many years our focus has been on homes when it comes to air pollution school attendance may result in a large dose of inhaled traffic pollutants that until now have been completely overlooked
5647006 major roads play an important role in the economy but we need to strike a balance between economic and health considerations as we break ground on new areas
5647007 policymakers need to develop new effective strategies that would encourage urban planners to reconsider our current infrastructure particularly when it comes to building new schools and maintaining existing ones
5647008 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
5647009 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery
5647010 robot assisted surgery has promise to bridge the limitations of laparoscopic surgery and allow more women with fistulas urinary incontinence or prolapsed pelvic organs to benefit from a minimally invasive approach
5647011 pulse oximetry and oxygen concentrators can alleviate oxygen shortages reduce mortality and improve quality of care for children with pneumonia in developing countries the cost effectiveness of this system compared favourably with that of other public health interventions
5647012 the substantial decrease in mortality that was seen in some papua new guinea hospitals suggests that oxygen treatment and monitoring is a key step forward in the fight against childhood pneumonia
5647013 timing and the extent of degradation should be carefully selected according to the changing requirements of the ongoing dynamic repair process
5647014 moreover since cspg is a major constituent of the glial scar the present findings raises the potential need to revisit the overall perception of the glial scar and its role in recovery a better understanding of the regulation of the scar tissue and the role of the naturally occurring cspg in health and disease will enable us to increase the benefit of endogenous repair mechanisms and improve many of the available therapies for cns injury

5647016 blood and marrow transplantation from unrelated donors has been routinely utilized to treat treatment refractory leukemia and lymphoma for almost two decades
5647017 preliminary results from the few unrelated donor transplants that have been performed for other non malignant conditions show great promise for those who suffer a severely diminished quality of life due to sickle cell disease participants in this large scale study will help us understand how to better treat and possibly even cure sickle cell disease for more people
5647018 open label study to assess the safety pharmacokinetics pk and pharmacodynamics pd of five oral insulin formulations in healthy subjects
5647019 the fact that oramed has been selected to present research at the easd conference underscores the importance of our work developing an oral insulin capsule
5647020 we look forward to sharing the results of our phase 1b trials with top diabetes researchers from around the world
5647021 as we have known there is no convincing evidence that abortion is a significant cause of psychiatric illness we must distinguish illnesses from feelings a woman may have many emotional reactions to an unwanted pregnancy and abortion most commonly relief but also sadness and a sense of loss these feelings can coexist and like feelings about any important life decision they can vary over time negative feelings often stem from the circumstances that led the woman to terminate the pregnancy such as an abusive relationship or a lack of social supports or from the circumstances of the abortion itself such as demonstrators at an abortion facility women have abortions because they understand the importance of good mothering they want to have wanted babies and to be able to give those babies what they need to grow up loved healthy and happy each woman contemplating abortion has her own history circumstances and values no one else can fully understand her individual situation every pregnant woman who is considering abortion has a right to accurate medical information about the risks and benefits of either continuing or terminating the pregnancy and to whatever medical and mental health care she wants and needs decisions about reproductive health should be made between a woman her family and her doctor the best way to protect the mental health of women considering abortion is to ensure that they have accurate unbiased information receive good medical care and are given support by family and friends whether they decide to continue or terminate their pregnancies the american psychiatric association opposes all constitutional amendments legislation and regulations restricting family planning and abortion services to any segment of the population
5647022 the current standard of care in allograft stem cell mobilization involving g csf requires donors to undergo treatment over a period of several days it is also associated with established risks such as bone pain and there have always been theoretical concerns that it could stimulate bone marrow abnormalities clearly a treatment that can reduce time to collection and also reduce risks associated with the use of g csf would represent a major advance for both donors and the patients who need blood stem cell transplants in the years ahead
5647023 these results indicate that hspc mobilization with plerixafor a direct antagonist of the sdf 1 cxcr interaction can safely and effectively mobilize functional hspc for the reconstitution of hematopoiesis without the requirement of g csf
5647024 rapid mobilization of functional donor hematopoietic cells without g csf using amd3100 an antagonist of the cxcr4 sdf 1 interaction
5647025 the positive results from our edema4 and edema3 trials support the potential of dx 88 as an important acute therapy for hae patients moreover profile as a recombinant subcutaneous therapy may offer treatment advantages to patients suffering from this debilitating and life threatening disease
5647026 we are extremely pleased that the edema4 results validate the promise of dx 88 as a potential treatment solution for the hae community
5647027 the dx 88 bla will include the most extensive placebo controlled assessment of any therapy for the treatment of hae and was based on a dyax developed comprehensive endpoint evaluation we look forward to submitting our bla and ultimately commercializing this innovative therapy
5647028 the combination of brain imaging and genetics research has exciting potential to reveal the genes that are important in the development of brain disorders
5647029 said hilary blumberg md neuroimaging expert and lead author of the study dr blumberg is an associate professor of psychiatry diagnostic radiology at the yale school of medicine and yale child study center as well as director of yales mood disorders research program
5647030 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5647031 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5647032 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5647033 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient
5647034 i think family burden is an issue i dont think it should govern what the final decision is but i do think it should be addressed
5647035 the totality of the research on cocoa flavanols is impressive this is just one more study adding to an increasing body of literature connecting regular cocoa flavanol consumption to blood flow and vascular health improvements throughout the body
5647036 though more research is needed these findings raise the possibility that flavanol rich cocoa products could be developed to help slow brain decline in older age
5647037 prevention of norovirus infection will require a robust immune response and our search for a good adjuvant has led us to immuneregens material
5647038 we welcome this interaction with their scientists and hope to be able to determine if viprovex is well matched with our antigen in the next six months
5647039 the ability of viprovexs active ingredient sar9 met o2 11 substance p to generate not only antibody mediated responses but also support cellular responses via activation of specific immune cells gives us strong reason to expect adjuvant activity when coupled with vaccines such as those being developed by the biodesign institute
5647040 with our compound able to stimulate the immune system via both antibody and cellular immune responses to co administered protein and dna immunogens we optimistically anticipate a productive collaboration with dr arntzens team
5647041 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5647042 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5647043 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5647044 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5647045 infectious diseases create an enormous burden on the worlds population from both a human suffering and an economic development perspective
5647046 one of the major challenges we face in stopping infectious disease outbreaks is predicting how control strategies such as vaccines will work by using computer models to conduct epidemiology in silicon we will be able to test the impact of new candidate vaccine technologies and select the most effective strategies
5647047 many infectious diseases are preventable by simple vaccination yet children in poor countries die of these diseases because they lack access to vaccines
5647048 by providing computer models to aid in decision making we will support efforts by the gates foundation and other partners to make vaccines safer and easier to administer and ultimately protect more children and adults against deadly infectious diseases
5647049 although a portion of our funds are earmarked for assistance outside of illinois medstart 5 wasnt designed to leave the state until 2010 it was important for us to control growth
5647050 when youre trying to assist a nine year old girl with a brain tumor in hospice or a wife whose husbands passing left her with no life insurance savings and possibly homeless you begin to re shuffle your strategy
5647051 were currently searching for strategic alliances and partnerships that will move us to the next level it would afford us the opportunity to support more families and hire staff its never a good feeling having to turn anyone away for such badly needed assistance
5647052 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three
5647053 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5647054 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5647055 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5647056 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically
5647057 a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country
5647058 the acceleration of russias ongoing effort to increase its influence
5647059 when there are russian populations linked to russia then those territories could break away so if ukraine insists on joining nato part of its territory could split away
5647060 in the past the answer would have been no this is not a proxy conflict between great powers but increasingly the answer is becoming yes
5647061 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
5647062 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
5647063 these are not credible allegations especially coming from the head of an organization like nato which has itself used not just disproportionate force but force against civilian targets and the civilian population especially in its conflict with yugoslavia in 1999
5647064 a valuable forum for dialogue to resolve complex political issues
5647065 we will talk amongst ourselves about natos relationship with russia
5647066 all the time and effort and energy they spent all goes for naught and theyre going to have to start over if they are going to do anything or appeal
5647067 either way i think we are in a much much better position
5647068 of any mechanism where this city can purge itself of wrongdoing
5647069 i think thats the appropriate venue its been the appropriate venue all along
5647070 ocean platform could take 20 pct of us oil imports

5647089 i love the fraternity brothers because theyre so young and such a contrasting team
5647090 one takes his time to think things out the other one loves to rush and go at a million miles an hour theres definitely tension between the two of them while theyre making decisions during the race
5647091 they are small we wanted to make sure that there wasnt anything to prevent us from putting that pack underneath the seat in front of us when we got on a plane we didnt want something to happen where we got delayed because of our luggage we thought that would help us go faster
5647092 we did extensive research on what to wear what was lightweight and would help us move the fastest
5647093 i think it was the longest i ever went without wearing a logo on my t shirt
5647094 we both tried to do some training along the lines of going down to our little gym but that was pretty much it
5647095 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
5647096 people were a little afraid we were going to pull a borat on them i told them we werent doing borat but what happened there is very very funny its not easy to shoot in places like that because they practically have no television industry
5647097 the teams have no idea how to get from point a to point b there
5647098 they dont know the language its very difficult to get through this country they get so stuck but they find so many fascinating solutions of how to get through everything one of the things the teams do there is go to a real life floating village its insane
5647099 were just happy to continue making the show as it is

5647106 however should that prove to be the case it only serves to further highlight the tragedy of this young mans murder
5647107 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5647108 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into

5647110 the british position is that aggression cannot and will not redraw the map of russias former near abroad
5647111 politically we need to reassert our commitment to its territorial integrity and like the eu last week to immediate international engagement with the long term settlement of the frozen conflicts

5647116 the war within a secret white house history 2006 2008
5647117 there has not been such an authoritative and intimate account of presidential decision making since the nixon tapes and the pentagon papers
5647118 this is the declassification of what went on in secret behind the scenes
5647119 takes readers deep inside the white house the pentagon the state department the intelligence agencies and the u s military headquarters in iraq
5647120 based on extensive interviews with participants contemporaneous notes and secret documents the book traces the internal debates tensions and critical turning points in the iraq war during an extraordinary two year period
5647121 andy comes to us with considerable premier league experience for a player of his age
5647122 this is about a publishers commitment to its author to get one of a very few pro obama books out into the marketplace in the shortest amount of time
5647123 our initial order was based on the book being available to all booksellers simultaneously an even playing field
5647124 they are not going to bully us and the book will be a huge success in spite of their boycott

5647127 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5647128 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5647129 muxtape zal voor een korte periode niet beschikbaar zijn omdat we bezig zijn met het oplossen van een probleem met de riaa
5647130 ik twijfel er enorm aan of we ooit nog lol kunnen hebben met muxtape

5647146 that was 1982 i was a windows user for the next 20 years
5647147 i love that damn phone and it will take a lot more than lost apps and dropped calls to get it out of my hands
5647148 we are very close to deciding to send the prime minister for the closing ceremony of the olympics to be participated by many foreign dignitaries
5647149 there is no doubt that the israeli regime and people are both against islam and muslims occupying their lands so how could we speak of friendship with them
5647150 why should people who think like that be one of the presidents colleagues
5647151 i have said before that we do not have any hostility against the israeli people and i still say the same thing proudly
5647152 in the end he also became the man who couldnt deliver bush was very slow to realize that he either had been had by musharraf or that musharraf was not up to the task historians will debate this for years
5647153 the new pakistani general hes just been elected not elected this guy took over office
5647154 it wasnt a personal relationship but musharraf tried to play it effectively for domestic advantage
5647155 we pretty much played the musharraf card ad nauseam eventually to pakistans detriment
5647156 so far ive found him to be a man of his word
5647157 the fundamental question i have for president musharraf is will these elections be under emergency rule or law because if they are its going to be hard for well itll be hard for those of us who have belief that hes advanced pakistans democracy to say thats thats still the case
5647158 president bush and vice president cheney backed a discredited dictator which has undercut our ability to work with the new government to eliminate the terrorist sanctuary that has re emerged in pakistans tribal areas
5647159 president musharraf took his country a long way in turning it back from the extremism that was starting to characterize it at the time of sept 11 2001 he also kept his promise to try and help a transition to free and fair elections we didnt agree with everything he did especially the state of emergency but he did take off the military uniform the elections were free and fair
5647160 he tried to play both ends moving against certain terrorist targets but more broadly letting the terrorists increase their influence in his own country he campaigned for democratic reform then staged faulty elections to help himself stay in power
5647161 we assure you that we will do our best to be the voice of africa along with african nations on the security council
5647162 while negotiations on a government of national unity are continuing it may be necessary to convene parliament to give effect to the will of the people as expressed in the parliamentary elections held on 29 march
5647163 we hope that no one would do anything to breach the memorandum of understanding on the talks
5647164 we dont have consensus to reconvene parliament how do you reconvene parliament with an illegitimate government
5647165 the zimbabwean issue is far from resolved and so the continent as a whole has a responsibility to continue to engage with us in finding solutions
5647166 part of it is actually a process of trying to unlock the deadlocks that have emerged in the negotiations
5647167 we havent changed too much from last year we lost a couple of big players in timana tahu and timmy smith but weve still got the core of the team there
5647168 we were one step away from the grand final last year and i still believe we can go all the way
5647169 a lot of people are writing us off now and everyone thinks the seasons been a big disappointment but if we get there were a big chance we might scare a few teams
5647170 i wouldnt be jumping out of our skin if i was them thinking that theyre back
5647171 no not at all you cant just come out and play like that one week and go back into your shell
5647172 he coach michael hagan has got one of the best rosters in the competition there in parramatta and theyre underachieving
5647173 youd have to ask yourself how come they dont perform like that three times out of four games or four out of four games to be quite honest
5647174 thirteen bodies that the enemy left behind have been recovered but their casualties are much higher
5647175 posturing to attack the base and engaged them with small arms fire
5647176 six blew themselves up six others died in the explosions and one died in gunfire from commandos their bodies have been recovered
5647177 the main thing im hoping for three weeks away from the semis is that we dont continually limp our way through the next three weeks and struggle when we get there
5647178 to be so good for 20 weeks it would be a shame now to undo all that as it would for the roosters
5647179 were both struggling a bit i think we spoke about five weeks ago about geez were in a good position could be top four and since then weve struggled a bit
5647180 they were brilliant for the first 12 14 weeks and maybe both of us have hit the wall
5647181 three weeks out its time to get some red cordial and have some coffee and do whatever you can to get a bit excited
5647182 we have to stand up and win games big games on the big stage and unfortunately weve let ourselves down in games like manly and brisbane
5647183 we just have to learn to handle it if were going to go good in the semi finals
5647184 unfortunately theres only a few of us who have played semi final football
5647185 the build up to the manly game had a semi final feel about it and maybe shellshocked a few of the boys so hopefully were a little bit more used to it now and we can handle it a bit better this week
5647186 i havent changed my mind i want to join everton
5647187 we are still in contact i hope now that rennes will accept to enter into negotiations with this english club

5647195 please dont focus on one particular topic this year we have great potential here for tourism and the forum must also focus on sustainable economies
5647196 there are quite a few investment opportunities in niue which has potential in tourism and people should seize the opportunities
5647197 after going through charley this doesnt seem nothing more than a gust of wind

5647242 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5647243 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5647244 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5647245 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5647246 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5647247 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5647248 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5647259 to lose one advisor is unfortunate to lose two is careless but to lose three in four months shows the wheels are coming off this new administration
5647260 why is boris losing yet another advisor has tim parker discovered that running london isnt as easy as running private business
5647261 tim parker was supposed to be the cornerstone of boris johnsons administration his exit after just a couple of months in fact confirms the chaos which has existed in boris johnsons administration since day one
5647262 this is the third resignation of one of boris johnsons most senior officers in only three months following deputy mayor ray lewis and deputy chief of staff james mcgrath and other deputy mayors and top appointees are known to be at one anothers throats within city hall
5647263 all this flows from boris johnsons incoherent policies for london and therefore incapacity to run the city
5647264 while some tory sections of the press gave a glowing evaluation of boris johnsons first 100 days the reality was quite different and those following the administration closely were fully aware of the growing chaos at its heart
5647265 this latest resignation after boris johnsons deputy chief of staff and his deputy ray lewis indicates how unfit the tories are not only to run london but also the country

5647296 the french are indicating that french forces in afghanistan have suffered a major loss of life in what is being describe as a number of battles against the taliban
5647297 one specific incident was in the area of kabul which again will be a worrying thing for nato forces and for president karzai that the taliban are still strong enough to maintain this kind of attack and inflict these sort of casualities at a very sensitive time
5647298 their presence is afghanistan was recently beefed up by president
5647299 i think it will mirror something of the discussion in britian about the loss of life and the justification of that loss of life in a war that seems not to be going natos way
5647300 the taliban really do not give up despite the forces against them they appear to control more of the country given that they are able to strike with such force and with such loss of life so close to the capital

5647328 mates and he suggests that obama identifies more with his
5647329 did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois
5647330 obama has yet to answer questions about whether he ever dealt drugs
5647331 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited

5647363 my friends and i had a lovely evening every thing was perfect the extensive and varied menu made it difficult to choose
5647364 the idea was to go out for a reasonably priced but still good early evening or late afternoon meal and bisque bar and brasserie certainly didnt disappoint the menu was extensive but not expensive the service was first class with the staff being very attentive and pleasant and the food was superb special mention required for the black amp white pudding starter and the chicken stuffed with haggis served with a simply superb sauce 10 out of 10 all round thank you
5647365 good atmosphere and the food was lovely and excellent value for money
5647366 good service and very reasonably priced the bar is very comfortable to sit in after youve had dinner
5647367 the service was excellent throughout the staff were very friendly and welcoming and the atmosphere was very relaxed the food arrived promptly and was an excellent standard a very varied and interesting menu something to appeal to everyone i would definitely return and will be recommending it to friends
5647368 lovely setting for a meal on way to the cinema the service was great food was excellent amp great value for money lovely bottle of red wine def do again
5647369 the food was fab i had the pheasant and it was the best i have tasted the staff were great too they delayed our table for us for nearly an hour so my husband could watch the football and it wasnt a problem
5647370 this is a lovely bistro with a relaxed feel excellent value for money
5647371 the food was of excellent quality although the portion sizes were very small service was good
5647372 service was excellent and meal exceptional intend to return in the very near future

5647376 too often it happens that believers even those who take an active part in the life of the church end up by separating their christian faith from its ethical requirements concerning life and thus fall into moral subjectivism and certain objectionable ways of acting
5647377 after months of hard work in the studio we finally have the master version of our new album entitled elliot desgagn s
5647378 we are all very stoked by the new album as we feel that this is the best release weve ever done and were impatient to share our songs with our fans you can now pre order prosthetic records

5647382 hand out 100 000 copies of the brochure is it immoral to vote for obama for president to catholics and evangelicals it has a profoundly jolting effect on readers
5647383 it is mind boggling that millions of catholics are considering voting for obama in spite of the fact that he is the most pro death candidate in history
5647384 worse yet is that they attempt to justify this abandonment of the unborn by citing the common good john paul ii specifically said such reasoning was against the teaching of the church
5647385 this new flyer will clear up any doubt for the open hearted who will be consistent with their faith i hope we can get a lot of volunteers this could really make a difference
5647386 the direct and intentional destruction of innocent human life from the moment of conception until natural death is always wrong and is not just one issue among many it must always be opposed
5647387 hailed new language for the democratic partys platform that calls for reducing abortion
5647388 from my perspective as a conservative evangelical barack obamas campaign and the democratic party have taken a historic and courageous step toward empowering women for an expanded range of choices and saving babies lives
5647389 inaccurately implied that catholic leaders shared the positive assessment the rev joel hunter gave the abortion plank of the democratic partys platform
5647390 the bishops have gone on record stating just the opposite and they are the ones who speak as the leaders of the catholic church in the united states and not political operatives for one party or another who happen to be catholic
5647391 in forming consciences for faithful citizenship the bishops wrote that opposing intrinsically evil acts has a special claim on our consciences and our actions and warned against a moral equivalence that would make no ethical distinctions between different kinds of issues involving human life and dignity

5647460 this might be a good time to take another look
5647461 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5647462 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5647463 since were now moving quickly toward 1 0 it may also help to know which direction were headed to help out weve also prepared a this will be a living document and well keep it up to date as the android landscape evolves currently it covers the next few months roughly through the end of the year and a bit into next year well update it with additional detail as we are able to but even right now it can help give you a picture of how things will play out as the first phones draw near enough of that though youre probably wondering whats actually new in the sdk well you should read the api delta report for all the details but here are a few highlights first and most obviously the new home screen is included along with a ton of ui changes for 1 0 some new applications are included an alarm clock calculator camera music player picture viewer and messaging for sms mms conversations several new development tools were added such as a graphical preview for xml layouts for users of eclipse and a tool for constructing 9 patch images since weve got a new home screen application now we thought the now obsolete version from the m5 early look sdk might be helpful to developers so its source is included as a sample a number of new apis are fleshed out and improved and others are now close to their final forms for 1 0 tons of bugs were fixed of course if you had problems with the mediaplayer try it now there are a lot of changes the ones in the list above are just my personal favorites so you should check out the links above for the full story not all the changes are additions though im sorry to say that we had to remove a few things such as the gtalkservice for security reasons and the bluetooth api theres a bit more detail in the links above and well follow up on those in particular here in this blog to give you the scoop in fact weve got a little list of topics we want to talk about here so stay tuned

5647518 omdat wolter erover aan het denken is zich te laten steriliseren wilde hij zijn testament op orde maken toen hij een uittreksel van zijn geboorteregister opvroeg bleek hij daar onder de naam walter kroes in te staan
5647519 de vader van wolter had destijds de taak om de naam van zijn pasgeboren zoon op te geven bij de gemeente wellicht was de ambtenaar van dienst hardhorend of weigerde hij een weinig voorkomende naam als wolter op te schrijven of was hij van het overijverige soort en verkeerde hij in de veronderstelling dat wolters ouders hun kind helemaal geen wolter maar walter wilde noemen de machtsdrift van sommige van die gasten kent geen grenzen
5647520 wolter weet niet meer wie hij is hij was altijd die jongen met die lekker klinkende maar toch wel aparte naam echt de naam van een goedgeluimde artiest een beetje vreemd maar wel lekker zeg maar wolter kroes dat is gezelligheid dat is lekker zingen als je er zin in hebt dat is een leuk contact met je publiek hebben een lekker huisje met een fijne vrouw en kinderen maar wat is walter kroes
5647521 wat is een walter kroes is dat een kraanmachinist een insectenverdelger iemand bij de plantsoenendienst een tandartsassistent ik weet het niet en wolter al helemaal niet die ligt nu waarschijnlijk zoals de hele week al in zijn bed naar het plafond te staren je moet je voorstellen al die jaren toen je nog onbekend was heb je moeten uitleggen dat je wolter heette walter vroegen de mensen dan nee zei je dan niet zonder trots mijn naam is wolter wolter kroes en nu blijkt het dus toch walter te zijn ja dan ga je jezelf vragen stellen en kom je op plekken waar je als mens niet wil komen daar komt nog eens bij dat wolter zijn zoontje wolter jr heeft genoemd wat moet je tegen zon ventje zeggen die begrijpt er helemaal niks van
5647522 ik hoop dat hij zich gewoon wolter blijft noemen maar ik durf niet met mijn voeten in het vuur te gaan spelen wolter houdt er niet van om zijn publiek voor de gek te houden hij heeft ook nooit begrepen dat leen huijzer zich lee towers liet noemen begrijp me goed hij heeft alle respect voor lee maar dat zou wolter nooit doen maar aan de andere kant dat wolter zijn publiek niet voor de gek wil houden wil nog niet zeggen dat walter daar ook principieel op tegen zou zijn mocht wolter besluiten walter te gaan heten en mocht blijken dat walter ook een artiest is dan hoop ik dat walter zich wolter wil blijven noemen het is toch een naam die je hebt opgebouwd

5647530 with the furor over the impending rate hike for internet radio stations wouldnt a good solution be for streaming internet stations to simply not play riaa affiliated labels music and focus on independent artists
5647531 nato also needs to reassure those partners likely to be the next targets of russian pressure and possible aggression first and foremost ukraine this means rethinking natos enlargement strategy in the mid 1990s nato adopted an enlargement strategy based on integration and not as a strategic response to russia we consciously raised the bar and requirements for new members our focus was less on protection than on democratic reforms to help anchor these countries to the west but we also consciously left ourselves the option of lowering the bar in the future if the security environment took a turn for the worse it now has done just that and we need to shift our criteria again

5647597 we said georgia would eventually become a member of nato alongside ukraine and thats certainly the position that we will be advocating today
5647598 there is disproportional use of violence and we should send also a clear signal that the russian troops should withdraw but im convinced that we should also have the possibility for dialogue between nato and russia in the future

5647625 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5647626 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues

5647632 we continue to evaluate post beijing activities that will allow us to reinforce our relationship with michael
5647633 its huge its the opportunity that no startup generally gets
5647634 with opportunity obviously theres a lot of responsibility for us to take advantage of it properly and do it in a way that not only benefits the company but also benefits michael

5647637 squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5647638 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5647639 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5647640 a protocol has been signed under which both sides have assumed an obligation to continue the contacts relating to the search for and return of prisoners
5647641 now these principles should be accepted by georgia and need to be followed with guarantees from russia the council of europe and the osce the organization for security and cooperation in europe i hope this will happen in the near future we expect relevant information
5647642 u s military transport aircraft are reported to have been airlifting some humanitarian cargoes to tbilisi airport
5647643 the position of the russian federation is unchanged we shall support any decision the people of south ossetia and abkhazia will make in conformity with the united nations charter the international convention of 1966 and the helsinki act on security and cooperation in europe
5647644 i listened to george bushs statement and was surprised the facts he cited are untrue
5647645 the talk focuses on georgian situations and measures that need to be taken to halt the conflict
5647646 its a box full of small square cards with interesting questions like
5647647 now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5647648 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square senator obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq
5647649 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5647650 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5647651 it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5647652 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5647653 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent senator obama
5647654 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5647655 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5647656 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5647657 it would be easy to give in and let inflation get out of control thats what happened in the 1970s
5647658 all being well inflation will fall again next year and will be much closer to the 2 target by the end of 2009
5647659 but that will only happen if people dont chase inflationary wage increases
5647660 everyone wants to protect their living standard but if everyone does it prices will just go up again as businesses try to cover their higher costs

5647663 i was coming over cape foulweather towards newport and enormous flashes just popped into view once i got a little over the hill
5647664 by the time i got into town it was directly overhead in some areas it was loud and frightening but still pretty cool
5647665 there was one huge bright flash where the sound was right away
5647666 first we shot a bit under the bridge because of the danger of goofing around a high vantage point with a metal tripod
5647667 the whole thing seemed to be dying down so we only got one good clip of a flash that lit up the bay and the bridge itself we eventually felt safe to move out into the open
5647668 the storm is remarkably similar to winter type systems and will produce strong winds
5647669 we have got to convince people this can be done and it would be good economics
5647670 there should be one state to prove you could do it and it should be you
5647671 i promise if you do it would rock the world
5647672 im positive it needs to be done because im tired of standing in windy places where they have no options
5647673 the number of penalties will decrease and the quality of care will dramatically improve as hospitals take action to improve
5647674 the entire intent of these fines is to improve the overall quality of care in california

5647681 initially we have to introduce this as a pilot project
5647682 depending upon the acceptance of the new scheme amongst the students we would go ahead the feedback from the students will also be sent to the central government
5647683 they should be allowed to live in a family environment they should be allowed to enjoy all other rights that other children enjoy
5647684 if a kumari wants to travel she should be allowed to do so
5647685 the government has also got to look after the welfare of the former kumaris
5647686 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
5647687 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
5647688 provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviours
5647689 the problem was the department indicated there was no intention to maintain the status quo while a consultation process occurs that is inconsistent with industrial principles
5647690 we have discussed what a reasonable and safe level of overtime is for each nurse and have agreed to amend the new draft procedures
5647691 these draft procedures will then be distributed to staff again for wider consultation before a final draft is presented to another meeting with the anf in two weeks
5647692 weve had a small group of nurses not all nurses doing an extraordinary amount of overtime
5647693 what were trying to do is ensure that there is good quality care and safe work practices can be sustained
5647694 weve introduced this policy with all of our mental health nurses across all of our acute units but there are just some sites where some staff are doing unsafe levels of overtime and glenside is one of those
5647695 we make no apologies for the tough action that is being taken in relation to this or any other home where potential problems with care are identified
5647696 brighton is working hard to ensure all residents are receiving the best possible quality of care
5647697 we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5647698 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5647699 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualise and make comparisons

5647746 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5647747 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector

5647749 i am just coming back from belgium where i went to attend my daughters wedding and the chairman told me that eguavoen has taken over so i have decided not to stay in the club any more
5647750 i cannot stay here any more when i have been told to work under somebody who is younger than me and also my junior i played nine champions league matches with enyimba and won seven
5647751 i have not put it in writing yet but i believe we will talk about it very soon
5647752 any team that underrates belgium will be doing so at their own peril for belgium to eliminate italy in the quarterfinal stage of this competition points to the fact that belgium is also a quality team that should be treated with respect and should be handled very well too
5647753 as for us we will take them as they come and i am also sure that with the understanding high spirit and the determination to achieve success coupled with resilience and hard work on the part of my team we will surely win the match to set us for the epic final on our way to winning the ultimate gold medal in the olympics games
5647754 i will be happy to become the first nigerian to lead our team to win a medal at the olympics
5647755 we cant start thinking about the gold medal when there is a match in front of us
5647756 that would not only be disrespectful to our opponents but could also come back to haunt us
5647757 we need to stay focused do the things we have practised in training and pray for a little luck it is only at the end of the game that we can talk about anything else

5647765 it doesnt really matter who gets in the new president is in for a very hard time it doesnt take too many more hundreds of billions in bailouts to be more than the taxpayers can handle

5647767 obama is a great talker but can he lead congress into the right moves to salvage the economy
5647768 no matter who wins the november election the economy will not improve overnight
5647769 we must find a way for the national government as well as state and local government to cut out the wasteful spending bring jobs back to america and find alternative energy sources
5647770 i do not like the war stance of mccain but have economic issues with more government programs and other democrat obama economics
5647771 more government in our lives and erode freedoms plus we know what happens to programs run by the government
5647772 it appears that the past eight years have resulted in one of the worst economies in decades the highest deficit severely damaged international reputation and the lowest support for womens rights since the 1970s
5647773 a positive but short lived effect on our countrys economy
5647774 i have been a grocery shopper for 50 years and i am dismayed at how much prices are rising
5647775 something must be done and soon and i am not sure a new president is the answer i keep listening to mccain and obamas plans to help our economy but wonder just how much they can do
5647776 once student enrollment settles often this is not until a week or two into the school year i will examine our needs as a total school facility and make decisions regarding how the mobile units can best accommodate these needs

5647778 the meeting was an effort to get feedback from neighbors
5647779 it was an effort to get input on our plan in a collaborative manner
5647780 it is important that we try to address the concerns of our neighbors the community and the town of summerfield the meeting on the 31st was the first step in that process
5647781 just how many grocery stores do we need in this area anyway
5647782 we already have a walgreens going up 100 yards from a cvs with a food lion behind it i thought this was summerfield not wendover avenue
5647783 if it were flat i would be much less concerned but that septic field slopes downward and could seep into the water systems it just doesnt stand to reason that that would work
5647784 the developer said they did a traffic study and this development wouldnt impact traffic by more than about two seconds
5647785 we are clearly taking those comments seriously thats really the stage were in now with the planning process
5647786 i understand peoples concerns about the negatives and redundancies associated with the proposed harris teeter in summerfield
5647787 summerfield was incorporated to provide protection from annexation by the city of greensboro and incursion of high density development
5647788 why in the world would we want this mess in summerfield
5647789 remember that the citizens of summerfield have the right under north carolina general statute 160 a 385 and 386 to file a protest petition to the summerfield city council
5647790 here we go again a group of big money investors trying to make summerfield more than just a nice place to raise a family
5647791 i think this development is a wonderful opportunity for the town

5647848 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5647849 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5647850 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5647851 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5647852 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5647853 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5647854 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5647855 this haircut is from this morning i cant directly say why i did it its connected with certain things that the olympic charter forbids but i will say that its symbolic
5647856 i am outraged by whats going on in tibet when i read about it i can hardly believe ill compete in a country that bloodily suppresses street protests and persecutes people who dont agree with the party i cant believe the chinese have launched an immense operation to block lhasa
5647857 unless the chinese regime becomes more moderate ill compete with my head shaved in a gesture of solidarity with the tibetan monks

5647860 less humorous and far more hectoring than whats the matter with kansas this volume quickly devolves into a highly partisan manichaean minded screed against conservatives and private sector economics mr frank comes across in these pages as a sort of parody of the liberal right wingers love to hate as someone in love with big government for the sake of big government and opposed to all manner of capitalism and entrepreneurial initiative
5647861 franks portrait of the conservative movement sacrifices complexity to caricature
5647862 with rare exceptions like john kenneth galbraith conservatives have been the best satirists in thomas frank
5647863 the lovers in the gargoyle have the intimacy of roommates who hook up when they get drunk not a time defying passion their thoughts feelings conversations and affections are so unformed so hampered by sentiment and under powered awkwardness that the courage endurance and under standing ascribed to them seem silly davidsons lovers are dysfunctional and quirky qualities that can look a bit like profundity from a distance but they dont have emotional or imaginative depth or range which at the end of the day are the only things that can make a love story deep and wide ranging
5647864 west has made 15 reporting trips to iraq over the last six years and is almost as personally invested in the current conflict as he was in vietnam this book his third on iraq is his attempt to ensure that the endgame in iraq turns out better than in his last war
5647865 sharp as he can be in his judgments he is equally sharp in identifying the virtues of what he doesnt like he gives a spacious view of the countryside whatever the particular road he hews through it he takes his subjects seriously but not himself like snow white you might say
5647866 i read the suicide index with a rapacity bordering on need with tears in my chest and in my eyes occasionally i had to put it down and leave the room more often i devoured it the book is the product of a loving daughters grief and part of her process of grieving but it is also the measured elegant gripping work of a professional writer who has set her powers of observation to work on her own family her parents and grandparents her uncle her sister her husband her son and on herself
5647867 the storys emotional intensity is relentless and all of it light or dark is rendered at the same fever pitch the most consuming love until tomorrow when itll get even better the most consuming pain until tomorrow when itll get even worse bella whose human self is bumbling always blushing and a terrible driver becomes the strongest most beautiful most confident vampire ever jacob who begins the tale impatient and cranky also ends up in a new exalted state it might be unreasonable to expect a young adult vampire romance novel to be anything other than hyper intense but what it left me with was this thought readers are permitted to be breathless but stories arent

5647884 theres been years of debate about what to do with those tv white spaces once they actually become freed up by the tv stations the time is now the broadcasters are moving out of that spectrum in february 2009 so google has joined a really broad coalition includes device makers dell philips electronics as well as traditional google rivals like microsoft were all speaking at one unified voice saying we dont believe that this spectrum should go for one companys exclusive use instead we want to see something more like wi fi

5647920 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

5647948 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
5647949 barack obama is going to have to win this thing or lose this thing on his own
5647950 we analysts have had to pretend to know what they are thinking
5647951 and so weve had to get by without really knowing what were talking about
5647952 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
5647953 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
5647954 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
5647955 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
5647956 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
5647957 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
5647958 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
5647959 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
5647960 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
5647961 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
5647962 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
5647963 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
5647964 sen obama made it clear that he was really going to get into the nuts and bolts of the kinds of questions oregonians are talking about and i think it has served him well in our state
5647965 im confident that once sen obama gets as well known in these larger states as he has in oregon he is going to see the same success elswhere
5647966 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5647967 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5647968 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5647969 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
5647970 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5647971 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5647972 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5647973 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5647974 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5647975 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
5647976 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
5647977 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
5647978 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
5647979 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
5647980 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5647981 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5647982 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5647983 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5647984 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5647985 die entsch digungssumme die vom gericht verh ngt worden ist ist bezeichnend und soll f r andere nutzer abschreckend wirken
5647986 das aktuelle urteil zeigt dass direkte ma nahmen gegen rechtsverletzer eine wichtige und effektive waffe im kampf gegen online piraterie sind

5647992 this is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it
5647993 i dont think theres anything more unseemly than the sight of a rock star in academic robes its a bit like when people put their king charles spaniels in little tartan sweats and hats its not natural and it doesnt make the dog any smarter
5647994 what happens is the water tunnels to the bottom and makes the ice like swiss cheese sort of like termites
5647995 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
5647996 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
5647997 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
5647998 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability

5648000 a full portfolio of resources can ease the energy crunch
5648001 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
5648002 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
5648003 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
5648004 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
5648005 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
5648006 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
5648007 id be remiss if i didnt say hello buddy cianci mayor of providence
5648008 i want you to know i was wearing my rhode island democrats t shirt when i was exercising this morning put that in the paper
5648009 i get amused when i see that stern faced young man from colorado extolling the merits of assault weapons
5648010 i didnt see any donkeys although we heard a weird sound when we first got in here
5648011 they must have you know seen me coming but they all hid somewhere
5648012 i dont care if you have jesus christ in the van
5648013 no i know if i needed to get out id make my way out just as i made my way in you have to see the possibilities
5648014 if my opponent had been there at the moon launch it would have been called a risky rocket scheme
5648015 if hed been there when edison was testing the light bulb it would have been a risky anti candle scheme
5648016 and if hed been there when the internet was invented
5648017 there was a ramp that went over the rubble my son brendan and i were able to come here and all the world stops when we had whole bodies or something that would resemble a whole body and people would line up on each side of this makeshift ramp and i went down with my son brendan and we were able to collect jonathan he was already in a basket and ive got to stop for a second so we were able to go down spend a little time and then brendan and myself and some of the guys in jons company we carried him up put him in an ambulance and took jon away we were blessed in a way because my son was a whole body
5648018 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
5648019 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
5648020 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
5648021 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
5648022 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
5648023 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
5648024 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
5648025 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
5648026 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
5648027 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
5648028 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
5648029 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
5648030 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
5648031 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
5648032 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
5648033 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
5648034 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
5648035 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5648036 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5648037 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5648038 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
5648039 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
5648040 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5648041 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
5648042 i used to watch the apprentice but its become big brother
5648043 they all live in a house together and are given tasks where do you recognise that i dont think its challenging any more
5648044 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5648045 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5648046 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5648047 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5648048 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5648049 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5648050 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5648051 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
5648052 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
5648053 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
5648054 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
5648055 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
5648056 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
5648057 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
5648058 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
5648059 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
5648060 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
5648061 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
5648062 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
5648063 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
5648064 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
5648065 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
5648066 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
5648067 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
5648068 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
5648069 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
5648070 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
5648071 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
5648072 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
5648073 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
5648074 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
5648075 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
5648076 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
5648077 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
5648078 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
5648079 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
5648080 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
5648081 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
5648082 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
5648083 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
5648084 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
5648085 just so you all know we did set a record
5648086 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
5648087 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
5648088 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
5648089 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
5648090 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
5648091 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
5648092 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
5648093 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
5648094 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
5648095 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
5648096 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
5648097 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
5648098 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
5648099 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
5648100 six flights in four days how i traveled across the country with my 10 month old baby
5648101 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
5648102 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
5648103 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
5648104 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
5648105 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5648106 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
5648107 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
5648108 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
5648109 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
5648110 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
5648111 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
5648112 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
5648113 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
5648114 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
5648115 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
5648116 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
5648117 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
5648118 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
5648119 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
5648120 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
5648121 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
5648122 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
5648123 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
5648124 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
5648125 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
5648126 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5648127 oh my gosh the ice caps are melting and were all gonna die before lunch
5648128 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative
5648129 which is as textbook a case of the pot calling the kettle black as has ever been recorded
5648130 gore is the person who in the congress most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an internet
5648131 has played a powerful role in policy terms that has supported its continued growth and application for which we should be thankful
5648132 selbst mit unserer durchmusterung haben wir bislang nur einen kleinen teil der galaxis erfasst
5648133 wenn jede von uns aufgesp rte geschwindigkeits struktur ein separater sternstrom ist dann ergibt sich f r die inneren 75 000 lichtjahre der milchstra e eine gesamtzahl von rund 1 000
5648134 in der zentralregion der galaxis kommen all diese str mungen zusammen und wir sehen dort eine homogene mischung von sternen
5648135 a fine example of classical revival school building from the turn of the last century the arlington school built in 1908 was bessemers first high school its most distinguishing features are the decorative brick and stone facade interior sky lighted basketball courts and an auditorium in the form of a jewel box theatre with a raked floor proscenium stage and horseshoe balcony once a part of a thriving middle class neighborhood the arlington school was abandoned in the early 1980s now dilapidated and out of use the schools state of disrepair is indicative of the decline in the surrounding neighborhood
5648136 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
5648137 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
5648138 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure
5648139 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
5648140 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
5648141 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
5648142 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
5648143 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
5648144 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
5648145 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
5648146 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
5648147 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
5648148 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
5648149 the film changed my life and my way of thinking i decided to do whatever i could
5648150 when i learned of their problem i decided to do something at least help them dig wells in their area which would provide a perennial source of water
5648151 when she expressed a desire to help people in rural maharashtra we decided to encourage her
5648152 she always had an inclination toward social service and we decided to cultivate it

5648155 lippi e mourinho che grandi scacchisti e io vorrei sfidare i portieri che mi hanno fermato dagli 11 metri
5648156 stato uno zio a farmi conoscere gli scacchi e la dama allepoca non cera la playstation al massimo avevamo i puzzle quei pomeriggi in casa mentre fuori pioveva compensavano tutta lattivit fisica che facevo
5648157 purtroppo no per quando ho iniziato a fare lallenatore ho capito che gli scacchi mi sarebbero potuti essere utili
5648158 perch hai bisogno di una strategia devi sempre cercare di essere una mossa avanti allavversario ti serve ragionare sul gioco delle mosse e contromosse tentare di portare lavversario fuori strada preparare un attacco e un po come preparare una partita lunica differenza che in mano hai dei pezzi e non delle persone da questo punto di vista il mestiere di allenatore ancora pi difficile
5648159 qualche volta ho alcuni amici a londra e in italia che sfido a scacchi o a backgammon mi aiuta a scaricare la tensione
5648160 ma io non sono a quei livelli distinto attacco sempre la regina anche se servirebbe una strategia globale
5648161 un modo interessante per far capire cosa si viva a certi livelli io mi sono fatto pi male giocando a calcio ma credo che gli scacchi siano la cosa che si avvicina di pi alle scelte che deve fare un generale davanti a un campo di battaglia
5648162 potenzialmente alcuni allenatori sono grandi scacchisti penso ai vari mourinho lippi capello in panchina una delle cose pi difficili mantenere la mente fredda senza poter scaricare la tensione e loro ci riescono sarei curioso di vederli davanti a un tavolino
5648163 i portieri anche quando tiri un rigore alla fine si sviluppa un sottile gioco psicologico tra te e chi cerca di fermare il tiro tutti i portieri che in carriera mi hanno parato un rigore come se mi avessero battuto a scacchi
5648164 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
5648165 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
5648166 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
5648167 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
5648168 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
5648169 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
5648170 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
5648171 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be a very important part for the success of a democracy you cant only make token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happened is token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
5648172 i wanted to buy a flat in bombay and it wasnt given to me because i was a muslim and i read the same about saif ali khan now i mean if javed akhtar and shabana azmi cannot get a flat in bombay because they are muslims then what are we talking about
5648173 thats why i am so distressed over what is happening in kashmir for heavens sake it should be brought to a stop and it should have been brought to a stop right when they started that nonsense
5648174 i dont think that the muslim leadership has bothered to clear the air about what islam actually is
5648175 if you are muslim you cant buy a flat in mumbai period
5648176 i could not buy a house and so i think indian democracy is faulty

5648200 nowhere in the post does ashley or shiny media note that perhaps not meeting customer needs or any other internal issues could have also led to the undesired results its very very easy to blame external factors i dont know ashley or shiny media but what i took out of his post was a good bit of education on the uk blogging market but a heck of a lot of bitching and moaning about external factors
5648201 let me clue you in on a little secret every business has external forces working against it every day
5648202 an industry just because some of the entrepreneurs in it naturally believe they should
5648203 clearly the belief that this document would never see the light of day provided a false level of comfort amongst some in conducting what amounts to a vindictive subjective and inaccurate evaluation
5648204 the picture that emerges is less than flattering and most embarrassing demonstrating a clear personal bias in which the previously named selectmen overstepped their authority and failed to fulfill their sworn obligation to
5648205 extremely disrespectful to the board of selectmen and is very unprofessional
5648206 i would appreciate it if you provide some additional information regarding this comment including how it relates to my evaluation
5648207 there was a continual theme in mr creamers statement that the board of selectmen tried to get jim mr malloy to change his mind
5648208 nobody ever tried to make jim change his mind about anything nobody ever tried to deprive anybody of their constitution rights that was a pretty far out statement that you make

5648219 nut in 15 languages and always carries an epipen which delivers an adrenalin shot into the thigh in emergencies in addition to the ones in my handbag and in our car
5648220 nut allergies are a growing phenomenon of the last 10 to 15 years says
5648221 one reason is that were all far too clean and our immune systems have become bored as they dont have dangerous proteins to fight against so they start attacking friendly proteins such as nuts
5648222 these countries have higher levels of parasitic infections than ours so its possible that their immune systems may be protected from allergies
5648223 those who eat peanut snacks early in life may in fact be protected against peanut allergy in contrast with previous studies which have suggested the opposite

5648230 and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour
5648231 why hast thou forsaken me the very son and the beloved of the father why hast thou made me to be abandoned
5648232 but thou art holy o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel
5648233 but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things
5648234 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus
5648235 christ sent me forth to preach because it is the preaching of the gospel the expounding of the living and the abiding word by the power of the spirit in the heart that is the power to salvation
5648236 but we want an effective way to get it across
5648237 but we preach christ crucified to the jews a stumbling block and to the greeks foolishness but to those who are called notice to those who are called both jew and greek christ the power effective and christ the wisdom of god
5648238 we preach we testify from the holy scriptures through the office that is given to us and through this preaching god calls
5648239 for this cause also we thank god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god now note which effectually worketh also in you that believe
5648240 o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth now note the words before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you
5648241 this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith
5648242 my word shall not return empty to me it shall accomplish the purpose to which i sent it

5648247 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
5648248 i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5648249 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
5648250 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
5648251 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge

5648285 i work in a restaurant i cant take off a whole shift to go sit in a caucus we need to all be on the same primary system why should 2 000 people in iowa have the same say as 2 million in pennsylvania
5648286 caucuses inherently disenfranchise the elderly disabled shift workers single parents and others whose circumstance prohibits participation in caucuses
5648287 allow party officials spouses employers or other aggressive participants to exert undue influence and coercion over voters
5648288 its time to eliminate caucuses from the presidential nomination process

5648318 the struggling companies are getting an even tougher road in the near future the question also is do they really have the resources the cash here
5648319 non cash rewards can work like a catalyst to motivate desired employee behaviors but are rarely wielded creatively or to complete advantage and traditionally these programs have been rudimentary affairs managed in spreadsheets and limited to fixed prizes
5648320 xactly rewards for force com makes non cash rewards viable and manageable on a large scale as part of an overall strategic compensation or employee retention program and in a manner that enables extensive personalization in bringing together non cash rewards incentive compensation management and crm xactly is breaking new ground in engaging employees motivating behaviors and aligning those behaviors with corporate goals
5648321 the impact of rewards like non cash incentives to your workforce and sales performance is significant managing them efficiently in a self service method that is automated is a critical step forward xactly rewards provides that solid step that can establish and improve your ability to leverage rewards and through integration with salesforce crm will help organizations extend their investment for great benefit
5648322 having already adopted xactlys flagship on demand application to successfully manage our companys cash based commissions process we are eager to look at automating our non cash incentives programs with xactly rewards for force com
5648323 the ability for our sales reps to choose personally meaningful rewards could be a powerful motivator and make non cash rewards a valuable complement to motivating behavior and getting them to go the extra mile
5648324 with its rewards application xactly has demonstrated how developing new applications natively on the force com platform can rapidly accelerate time to market and product innovation
5648325 a leading partner on the force com appexchange xactly is showing how isvs can leverage the benefits of force com for application development and delivery rather than building and maintaining their own service infrastructure with hundreds of isvs already using the force com appexchange as a distribution channel we are seeing incredible momentum for force com as the cloud platform of choice for building running and marketing saas applications
5648326 with its advanced search capability the talisma knowledgebase steps ahead of the competition and significantly improves first contact resolution rates with knowledge driven web self service and assisted service
5648327 our knowledge base also remains the most flexible scalable and easy to implement knowledge management solution with a lower total cost of ownership than competitive tools

5648338 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5648339 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5648340 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5648341 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5648342 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
5648343 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
5648344 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5648345 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5648346 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5648347 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5648348 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5648349 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5648350 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5648351 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5648352 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5648353 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5648354 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5648355 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5648356 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5648357 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
5648358 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5648359 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5648360 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5648361 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5648362 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5648363 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5648364 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5648365 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5648366 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5648367 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5648368 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5648369 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5648370 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5648371 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca

5648384 without bees there would be no jam no honey no fruit amp very few vegetables
5648385 our diet would be considerably less interesting amp the government could forget all about its five a day campaign
5648386 if people were to take over from bees in the britain it would require a workforce of thirty million

5648389 following an internal review bt believes it is necessary to revise the methodology it uses for estimating turnover for partial private circuits leased lines to other telecoms providers within these statements any revisions made in this area will not impact on the bt groups statutory financial results
5648390 should this timetable impact the setting of any price controls for partial private circuits and wholesale ethernet products bt accepts that such controls would have effect from 1 october retrospectively
5648391 ukcta is disappointed to learn that bt has uncovered problems within its regulatory financial statements relating to leased line circuits bts regulatory accounts are a cornerstone of the uks regulatory regime which ofcom use to set cost based wholesale prices as well as acting as a first order test that bt has complied with some of its most important regulatory obligations
5648392 as a result of bts announcement confidence in bts compliance with its regulatory obligations has been severely dented in particular it raises questions about the reliability of bts previous years regulatory accounts and whether bt will need to restate such regulatory accounts as well as whether there are other telecoms products that are affected

5648445 young adults are still willing to change their schedules to catch their favourite shows live so that they can talk about them with their friends right away

5648458 the problem we have faced in the past is producing enough of these coiled carbon nanotubes at a reasonable cost to make a difference

5648462 i think weve got a good mix of contracted players and some young academy players and club players who have worked really hard for an opportunity
5648463 i feel confident that the young guys weve selected will certainly aim up and they really need to because its going to be difficult rugby
5648464 whilst its not ideal that we go away with a limited preparation its a fantastic opportunity for this group to begin our super 14 2009 preparations
5648465 one of the beauties of this tour is we can take players out of their comfort zone in terms of the travel in terms of the short schedule between games so guys will really have to be vigilant with their preparation
5648466 you dont get any easy games in france so theyll provide us with a different style of opposition to the irish
5648467 were hopeful that well give a good account of ourselves in all four matches
5648468 thats the beauty of a trip like this it gives our young guys the opportunity to play high quality opposition in intimidating settings without having to play for the added pressure of competition points it does enable us to try things that we maybe couldnt try in the super 14 competition
5648469 aiden toua has done well for easts in the premier competition and was quite explosive at times during the barbarians game so to see him against fully fledged opposition will be exciting young luke morahan is a big raw boned athlete at age 18 and were excited about the potential he offers us and young jono lance at 10 its a pretty big call to send an 18 year old playmaker over but we see something in jono and itll be exciting to see how he develops over the course of the tour

5648492 if we are too cautious we will not move forward and ultimately risk losing our competitive edge on the other hand if there is a significant risk to health or the environment we should not rush into adopting new technologies it all depends on our assessments of the benefits and costs and on whether the risks can be managed
5648493 in cases where the impact of new technologies is relatively unknown or contested
5648494 for example when it comes to reproductive medicine and the use of stem cells
5648495 a common approach is needed to avoid a fragmentation of the single market over product safety issues
5648496 decision makers recognise the risk of inaction if the eu fails to act quickly on new technologies
5648497 what certainly needs to improve is the speed of response

5648520 the numbers suggest that people are growing more accustomed to the current economic situation
5648521 specifically young americans likely are realizing they have time on their side to improve their financial security but that doesnt mean they are or should be comfortable those who have made the lifestyle adjustments or put a new plan in place should feel better about their ability to weather this economy our concern is for those who have not taken those steps or who are not sticking to their plan
5648522 there is much more to financial security than what happens on wall street it is encouraging to see people are growing more confident about protecting their home and possessions and using life and disability insurance to protect their income should the unthinkable happen

5648544 i played most of my career as a winger but i have played as a striker before
5648545 i want to play and i want to be part of the team so it doesnt matter where i play the manager said i have something he likes as a striker so i have to keep showing him why i should be picked
5648546 i will keep trying and when i get the chances i will try to score some goals

5648551 the fact that i am in the under 21s will not affect my game and i aim to make sure it will not be long before i am in the senior squad hopefully i will be back with the big boys again very soon
5648552 there are a lot of good players available to the england manager but if he had been at villa he would have seen an outstanding performance from micah

5648601 he represented for china a symbol of the new china the new strength
5648602 hopes were that he would take the gold in track and field in an area that china was never really strong in so a great deal of disappointment for china
5648603 in watching warm ups we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5648604 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5648605 weve heard from a lot of coaches that many of the athletes are put through a great pressure cooker here in terms of performing

5648607 continuing worries about a u s economy slowdown which may spread to the euro zone and perhaps also asia are weighing down on oil pricing
5648608 in the near term there will be a lot of downward pressure but i dont foresee a fast collapse of pricing to 100 dollars a barrel or below there is still strong support at 110 a barrel level because of supply side issues

5648669 my heart goes out to the king family and i am sure they seek justice for their terrible loss but the schools management should be sanctioned for its failure to tackle homophobia and transphobia within its community not for letting its students assert their identity
5648670 the worst thing about this turn of events is that it conjures up the dark days of empire when the murderer could claim gay panic defence if this family succeeds in this case what is to stop larrys killer claiming the schools failure to act provoked him to carry out the killing the situation is at best absurd and at worst very dangerous
5648671 they have sometimes done so on highly unfavourable terms for poor farmers
5648672 farmers more food insecure and governments reliant on unpredictable aid flows

5648711 after more than a month of use extensively testing the ts 409 we were left very favorably impressed especially with the seemingly endless array of features and available configurations the ts 409 pro offered good performance data protection and differentiated themselves from their competition
5648712 the added value comes from the extra disks and raid levels supported and when i say raid im not talking about a simple onboard controller the qnap ts 409 pro surprised me with raid 6 although slightly pointless with only 4 disks and features like online expansion and migration such functionality is usually only found on advanced controllers youd find in high end servers
5648713 its good to be involved in goals however they come if im popping up with assists then it means im involved and contributing to the game so im happy
5648714 whether im scoring making assists or tackling back ill do whatever it takes to help the team
5648715 at the same time of course i want to score i was chuffed to get that one on saturday because thats what i love doing
5648716 chris was waiting for the penalty but he had no chance he asked me if i was sure i wanted to take it and i just said stupid question
5648717 its good to have it though because wed sooner have people wanting to take them than not wanting to take them
5648718 im happy to take them and will continue doing so until anything changes which it wont i like that sort of responsibility and am just happy to score goals and more importantly that the team wins
5648719 people that have come in like chris have done well and everyone is pushing each other its no surprise the impact hes had hes proven at scoring at this level
5648720 hes also got that bit more experience and nous than the rest of us he does his job really well

5648771 perceptions of which foods should be eaten in moderation and an understanding of balancing a diet appear to be weak
5648772 we know that families in some communities still use the corner shop on a daily basis for their food and household goods
5648773 it is therefore essential that we take healthy eating options to these stores and reach those families who are at the greatest risk of poor health due to a poor diet
5648774 it s important that people have the opportunity to buy fresh fruit and vegetables where it is convenient for them
5648775 carl woese and his colleagues years ago established that protein translation had to be well developed when the evolution of modern cells started
5648776 so the evolution of cells and the evolution of translation are really linked to one another
5648777 to be a molecular signature a sequence has to be common to all members of a single domain of life but not another
5648778 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5648779 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5648780 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5648781 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5648791 the only explanation was the many masterpieces of the nineteenth and twentieth century
5648792 i was then supposed to deliver in the catalogue an intellectual substantiation for the show to write something art historical to legitimate and to confirm the stringing together of these masterpieces
5648793 middelschulte did not want a show of contemporary artworks from the olbricht collection since too much sex comes up in this work and things that he could not stand so this exhibition did not take place
5648794 it doesnt depend on the structure but the people involved

5648805 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5648806 we see the shares falling back again possibly towards their recent low of 208 pence as the sector overall gives back some of its recent rally
5648807 there is confusion and an element of denial over direct property pricing due to a lack of transactions
5648808 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
5648809 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be take are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge there are limits therefore to what can be delegated
5648810 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor we have therefore decided to adjust the management structure and abolish that position
5648811 at the beginning everything was new to the herd which numbered 100 cows building layout had changed and cows had the freedom of fresh grass paddocks as well as freedom to be milked when they chose either of the two lely astronaut robotic milkers
5648812 cows are in much better health and vet bills for mastitis have substantially reduced consequently we can now afford to make better use of key vet services
5648813 we are currently aiming to produce between 6000 and 6400 litres every two days all year round from 109 milking cows two farmers and 150 acres of grass and central to this has been improved grass and slurry management were steadily improving and im determined to improve further to help reduce feed and fertiliser costs
5648814 it was a bit of an anti climax how it happened but im not going to complain about that
5648815 i didnt really know what had happened when the fight was stopped i just said thank god he had been a thorn in my side in the past and i was determined it wasnt going to happen again
5648816 cammarelle took me off the road to athens but i wasnt mature then im mature now maybe not fully mature but enough to do this job
5648817 i saw the medals tally up on a notice board at the gb headquarters and it made me even more determined to add to it the trouble comes in your mind when you think about what it means to you and the people around you
5648818 he is my idol and i want to be as much like him as i can
5648819 is that im not facing an olympic semi final its just another semi final in some routine championship

5648822 i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5648823 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months
5648824 were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5648825 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5648826 the web didnt introduce a new competitor into the old ecosystem the web created a new ecosystem
5648827 the more an institution or industry relies on information as its core product the greater and more complete the change will be
5648828 we would like to support the effort to have a formal geographical indication of course at national level there would be a subsequent international recognition of this product of banarsi silk sarees and brocades and other products that should be gaining in terms of more value outside india as well
5648829 we are facing problems due to machine made sarees our production rate is less compared to them they produce many sarees compared to our hand woven sarees each saree takes 15 16 days to produce we have incurred a huge loss because of the competition in the market government is not helping us many weavers have closed their shop
5648830 we hope that panitchpakdis visit would reap some benefit for us as we are on the verge of starvation we hope for some help from his end

5648832 the new prime minister yousuf raza gilani who was in washington this week to meet president bush says he is doing his best to convince his country that this is pakistans war but he seems not to have won the argument within his own government
5648833 this complex situation calls for a careful and flexible response from the united states and to its credit the outgoing bush administration is making a relatively good start at fashioning that response
5648834 gillani on his first official us visit since being elected in february was left in no doubt that the bush administration had lost patience with the isis alleged double game
5648835 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648836 the fact that we have young people over there who have u s passports is of tremendous concern because of their ability to come back into the united states
5648837 we have previously said that increased activity in the pakistani tribal areas gives us some reason for concern
5648838 we have also previously talked about our concerns that al qaida is seeking to recruit western looking sympathizers with no criminal records who could more easily blend in and attempt to travel to the united states
5648839 no credible information at this time to suggest an imminent threat to the homeland or u s interests at the olympics
5648840 i understand there is a problem of extremism at some madrassas
5648841 but to put everyone under this broad net of suspicion is beginning to infringe on peoples civil liberties
5648842 michael mccauls failed publicity stunt shows it is past time for new leadership in texas 10th congressional district
5648843 a nice sound bite that trivializes a very serious issue for this country
5648844 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648845 it confirmed some suspicions that i think were widely held
5648846 it was sort of this aha moment there was a sense that there was finally direct proof
5648847 and asked about leaked information that tipped militants to surveillance efforts by western intelligence services
5648848 thats probably something the government of pakistan ought to speak to
5648849 we and some of our allies have evidence not only from the scene of the explosion but evidence beyond it that unfortunately indicate a hand like that
5648850 we are fairly confident of what you are talking about
5648851 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648852 strong evidence and circumstantial evidence of american acquiescence to terrorism inside pakistan
5648853 carrying what were seen as india influenced intelligence inputs had hardened the resolve of pakistans security establishment to keep supreme pakistans national security interest even if it meant straining ties with the us and nato
5648854 not to distinguish between a terrorist for the united states and afghanistan and a terrorist for pakistan
5648855 for reasons best known to langley the cia headquarters as well as the pentagon pakistani officials say the americans were not interested in disrupting the kabul based fountainhead of terrorism in balochistan nor do they want to allocate the marvellous predator unmanned armed aerial combat vehicle resource to neutralise the kingpin of suicide bombings against the pakistani military establishment now hiding near the pakistan afghan border
5648856 pakistans enemy number one and the mastermind of almost every suicide operation against the pakistan army and the isi since june 2006
5648857 the united states military has the capacity to direct a missile to a precise location at very short notice as it has done close to 20 times in the last few years to hit al qaeda targets inside pakistan
5648858 have long been intrigued by the presence of highly encrypted communications gear with mehsud this communication gear enables him to collect real time information on pakistani troop movements from an unidentified foreign source without being intercepted by pakistani intelligence
5648859 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648860 there is a cold war between india and pakistan they say hands off kashmir we say hands off afghanistan
5648861 there is just enough pakistan co operation with the us to get away with it
5648862 but the us agenda is not innocent either they desire a larger role for themselves in the muslim world
5648863 the isi is going to determine the destiny of pakistan perhaps in the near future
5648864 during the afghan jihad so many things were created by pakistan now these elements are out of control
5648865 the indian statement is not only surprising but shocking too
5648866 some rogue elements in the isi are working against the interest of the country they are being funded by a terror sponsor state the us
5648867 anytime the supreme court called the interior ministry or the defense ministry they could not get the isi into the court
5648868 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648869 we have received information that nearly 800 militants are waiting to cross over to india at the borders
5648870 the wired fencing at border areas is being further strengthened
5648871 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648872 mullah rahmatullah tried to show that the afghan government is weak in kandahar
5648873 after the arrest mullah rahmatullah confessed to his crimes and said he received orders and money for all terroristic activities and for the kidnappings from one of the members of pakistans consulate in kandahar
5648874 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648875 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648876 what the deputies committee has raised is given the possibility that political fragmentation in pakistan is going to continue do we need to change our strategy
5648877 the argument that we may destabilize pakistan has taken us to where we are right now
5648878 pursuing the policy of public praise and private pressure on pakistan doesnt work
5648879 we need to enhance the capacity of hitting these targets
5648880 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648881 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5648882 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5648883 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5648884 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5648885 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648886 you are butchers liars and hypocrites you keep on talking about terrorism to the media but behind closed doors you support terrorism
5648887 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648888 this particular air force exercise is important because india is included among some very important allies
5648889 this is definitely an extension of an arc that has been mapped out since 2000 and it really signifies that what india and the united states have is a strategic relationship
5648890 the united states is very keen that india become important
5648891 indias going to be doing what it wants to do in the area that china thinks is important and a more capable strong india will be able to prevent chinese hegemony more so than a weak india
5648892 we will learn how our allies operate in response to similar threats
5648893 it will allow us to build observations to eventually learn those lessons about what it takes to integrate talk fly with employ deploy and sustain air power with places like india korea and france
5648894 pyongyang through its state run news agency the korean central news agency has consistently and passionately criticized such ventures accusing the united states of harboring hostile intentions toward north korea
5648895 beijing would likely remain reticent about such training since it does not see itself as directly and imminently affected by such activities
5648896 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648897 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
5648898 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism
5648899 abandon the idea that the afghan government will be under its control
5648900 we do not want to be the slaves or puppets of other countries
5648901 this is not true we have no reports of missiles being fired into pakistan
5648902 it is not clear whether wazir survived the attack or not but his brother abdur rehman and one of their close relatives abdul salam were killed in the strike
5648903 they were three men who suddenly stood up during the meeting and one of them opened fire on him
5648904 if these kinds of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
5648905 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
5648906 reiterated the resolve of the nation to remain determined and not yield to pressures created by such heinous crimes
5648907 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648908 were being told by western envoys that its not going to bring more stability to have a long trial and that it is in the interests of stability for him to exit
5648909 we are very clear that we have no role to play in this impeachment process britain has no interest in talking about the fate of individuals
5648910 there is a link between musharraf and the army so humiliating him is like humiliating the army
5648911 the us administration would have much preferred to see a workable political arrangement between musharraf and the government not another looming transition
5648912 whoever abrogates the constitution must be punished or we will never stop these dictators usurping power here
5648913 this is a man who stood up against al qaida who will face al qaida after musharraf certainly not this coalition
5648914 the anti terrorist squad of uttar pradesh has arrested one isi agent of pakistan from rupaideeha in bahraich district we have come to know that his name is mohamad masrur alias manzoor ansari who is son of noor muhammad he is native of 154 4 garden west adul jabbar compound near nazeer hotel karachi
5648915 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
5648916 extremists wanted to establish their hold in bajaur and the government had to take action
5648917 until today 462 militants have been killed in bajaur and a similar number have been injured twenty two troops have been killed and some are missing in action
5648918 whether i win or lose the impeachment the nation will lose
5648919 they dont realize they can succeed against me but the country will undergo irreparable damage
5648920 i will live and die in pakistan there is no other way
5648921 historians will not forgive musharraf he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
5648922 there will be a more balanced view of him in the future than there is now
5648923 a lot of things happened in pakistan for the good under his watch and i think that is something the history books will recall after some time
5648924 as far as democracy in pakistan is concerned historians will not forgive him
5648925 he manipulated elections he hounded his opponents and he became a dictator its not much of a legacy
5648926 he never tried to create an impression in pakistan that we were fighting for our own country and our own good
5648927 and because of that the pakistan army became a client army and pakistan became a client state in the eyes of the people it was a major failing on his part
5648928 he didnt understand that a country of 160 million people couldnt be ruled by just one man
5648929 at the moment i can say that 25 people have died in the attack
5648930 determining what the priorities should be is not difficult militancy the economy and relations with india and afghanistan need to be addressed urgently
5648931 solutions however may prove more elusive but at the very least the politicians must show the same purpose and focus in dealing with the problems that they have demonstrated in taking on the president
5648932 the coalition must quickly nominate and elect a joint candidate as president and avoid lengthy political bargaining
5648933 it is time for the elected government to show people their ballots were not wasted
5648934 the coalition partners must demonstrate they are capable of insightful leadership political wisdom and can live up to the task of guiding the country with musharraf gone they no longer have an excuse for failure
5648935 the coalition has won an important battle so it has to work on an emergency basis to resolve the economic crisis and the announcement of a relief package for the people should be a government priority
5648936 his legacy is undeniably there and the good that he did must stand even though this is too emotional and passionate a moment to dwell on it with any degree of objectivity

5648947 the minimum information needed for the purpose at hand should be released and only to those who need it details should be retained no longer than necessary
5648948 it should not be possible to automatically link up everything we do in all aspects of how we use the internet a single identifier that stitches everything up would have many unintended consequences
5648949 we need choice in terms of who provides our identity information in different contexts
5648950 the system must be built so we can understand how it works make rational decisions and protect ourselves

5648958 our shareholders confidence has always been the cornerstone on which zain has based all its decisions ever since the group launched its strategic profitable expansion strategy in 2003
5648959 all the groups financial indicators are now set to witness exponential growth on the back of zains huge investments in network infrastructure in many of the middle east and african markets in which we operate this capital increase will be instrumental in supporting our target of zain becoming one of the top 10 global mobile telecom operators by 2011

5648967 my whole strategy today was just to find a nice rhythm
5648968 i didnt want to put in too much or get too excited now it is down to the semi final on wednesday i will have to raise my game for that one for sure
5648969 obviously there is a lot of background that goes into getting to the olympics so that obviously adds up to how you are feeling when you get onto the water
5648970 i was nervous at the start but mostly about my start which is so critical in a c1
5648971 but i managed to get a good start and i am happy with my race
5648972 it is a huge thing for me to be here it is impossible to explain it is gripping
5648973 sometimes i start to feel lucky just to be here but then i realise that i deserve it and it is part of my plan to keep improving my performance for london 2012

5649223 if the demand continues like this we jewellers will run out of gold stocks
5649224 i am getting a lot of inquiries from people wanting to buy gold after the fall in prices
5649225 jewellery prices have fallen now and given the way prices are fluctuating i plan to buy gold jewellery this week
5649226 but we are now seeing strong and growing demand at lower prices in the worlds largest gold buying market of india and believe international investment demand in the retail coins and bars market will also strengthen
5649227 i certainly hope the prices fall further as this is boosting demand
5649228 the price spike had hit our sales hard and a correction in prices was long overdue
5649229 the gold market situation is now crazy the fluctuation in prices are affecting our business
5649230 people are buying gold at this price but it all depends on the global market
5649231 you cant make a judgement now on future rates as one of the key determinant of prices is the us dollar

5649235 but it was the right decision to make abandoning her right at the finish would have been much easier but selfish on my part i guess i felt that by helping her achieve her highest as the sole u s representative it would in some way be a small consolation for me and i could move on to focusing on 2012
5649236 we are both very excited to be together again after such a long year
5649237 this last year has been an incredible journey for both of us
5649238 and we will be bonded for life because of it

5649352 at the beginning of june i went to the theatre for my final rehearsal of the play we were performing that evening it was called the birthday of the infanta by oscar wilde i was very excited and nervous at the same time face paint first of all we sat down and had a little chat but soon we were rehearsing on stage it was a bit scary because we were only allowed one rehearsal on stage before it was the actual thing after the rehearsal we went back to the room we were using and i had my face paint done as i was a gypsy and a carnation remembered lines then we had to wait along the corridor ready to go on stage i was so nervous in the end the play all went well and i remembered all my lines i was really proud of myself and hope to be in another play some time

5649360 i arrived bright and early at a childrens centre in london with a mike and some serious questions alex gets ready with his questions i interviewed beverley hughes in the playground where the children were playing in the background she was very friendly and not at all how i expected her to be internet safety i asked beverley what the most important issues affecting children today were issues which are important to children and often in the headlines she told me that internet safety was a big issue children should be able to use the internet but it had to be in a safe way i also asked the minister about bullying and if she was a head teacher what would she do about it she said that she wouldnt tolerate bullying and would make sure that all the teachers and pupils knew that it would not go on in her school i think exams are another important issue and i asked the minister if she thought they were necessary she said that sats were really important because before sats were introduced kids were leaving school without reading and writing properly she said that exams teach you all the things you need to know before you leave school and are very important wonderful opportunity like me you may not have known a great deal about the role of the childrens minister but having met her i think that its a good idea to have a politician looking out for kids i had an awesome day and im very pleased to have had this wonderful opportunity

5649372 our search implementation is based on a customized version of the lucene open source platform
5649373 to date we have spent a little under a 1m on crawling and indexing infrastructure but we expect another 1 5m with this new investment
5649374 property prices per square metre on new build have doubled in the past three years in hotspots like marrakech and tangiers
5649375 but thats to be expected more critical to investor confidence is the governments measured approach to boom times with a secure land registration system and a working blueprint for sustainable coastal development
5649376 residents also get a 50 per cent reduction in golf membership for all three courses
5649377 the resort has been popular with wealthy moroccans for years
5649378 its close proximity to marrakech and its quality off piste and cross country options draw a loyal following but its full potential has never been exploited the ski season is reliable running from january to march while plans to upgrade mountain biking trekking and climbing amenities in the summer months will also maintain steady visitor numbers throughout the year
5649379 planning guidelines however are stringent no building can exceed three storeys and build density on developments can be no more than 60 per cent
5649380 it suits buyers who prefer to be away from tourist hordes yet youre only 25 minutes from marrakech
5649381 this is undoubtedly one of the best spots to build and buy
5649382 a days skiing or a leisurely stroll around marrakech medina why choose when you can have both
5649383 its a popular neighbourhood with expats and properties rarely stay on the market for long
5649384 essaouira is now fashionable among moroccans as well as being a favourite spot with jaded urbanites due to its coastal location
5649385 its not as frantic as marrakech yet theres enough going on with the beach hammams and spa as well as a large souk to potter about in property prices have risen by ten per cent in the last year with a similar forecast expected for 2008 9
5649386 der j ngste r ckgang des lpreises sowie die abwertung des euro gegen ber dem us dollar d rften die sorgen um die konjunktur gemildert haben
5649387 die finanzmarktexperten haben sich von der negativen zuwachsrate des bruttoinlandsprodukts im zweiten quartal zu recht nicht sonderlich beeindrucken lassen insgesamt gehen sie von einer zwar schw cheren aber alles in allem robusten konjunkturentwicklung aus und bef rchten keine rezession
5649388 ich kann nur davor warnen die konfrontation mit russland zu suchen
5649389 wir k nnen die probleme nur gemeinsam l sen man muss sehen dass wir es mit einem neuen russland zu tun haben nach dem tiefen tal durch das es nach 1990 gegangen ist wir haben nun ein russland dass nicht nur politisch sondern auch milit risch erstarkt ist da muss man im gespr ch bleiben die nato ist daf r das richtige forum
5649390 ich sehe nicht dass eine neue phase der konfrontation entsteht schon gar nicht ein kalter krieg das war ein singul res ereignis als folge des zweiten weltkrieges

5649401 if youve got a couple of minutes perhaps you could find out what it is its been there at least half an hour and its still there
5649402 its been there for half an hour right is it actually on the mountain or in the sky
5649403 i will send someone up there now to check it out
5649404 alpha zulu 20 this object in the sky did anyone have a look at it
5649405 there is no doubt in my mind that the public have taken on board the message we sent about making inappropriate 999 calls and thought twice about dialling the number in a non emergency situation for which we are extremely grateful
5649406 thanks to the public we have been able to answer calls concerning real emergencies quicker
5649407 some people view it as an investment which is the wrong way of looking at it unless youre jimmy the greek

5649421 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
5649422 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
5649423 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
5649424 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
5649425 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
5649426 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero

5649428 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
5649429 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
5649430 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
5649431 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
5649432 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
5649433 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
5649434 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
5649435 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
5649436 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
5649437 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
5649438 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5649439 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
5649440 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
5649441 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
5649442 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
5649443 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
5649444 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
5649445 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
5649446 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
5649447 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
5649448 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
5649449 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
5649450 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
5649451 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
5649452 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
5649453 while i am mindful of the economic challenges facing carriers today waiving the excess baggage fee for our men and women in uniform would not impose a significant financial burden
5649454 i applaud american airlines for its decision to waive the baggage fees for up to three pieces of checked luggage for military personnel i hope that all other airlines will follow americans example
5649455 at a time when more than 200 000 of our men and women in uniform are deployed overseas including combat operations in
5649456 there is safety in information parents and students need to know that college campuses are doing all they can to keep students safe we must take every step possible to prevent a tragedy like the seton hall fire from ever happening again i am glad our bill is now law so we can finally give the public the information it needs to evaluate fire safety at colleges and universities
5649457 i am pleased that our work to close a dangerous public safety loophole at college campuses all over the nation has finally paid off if these common sense fire safety disclosure requirements were in place years ago lives may have been saved and perhaps fewer families and classmates would have experienced the horrific shock and pain that overwhelmed the seton hall community in 2000
5649458 college students should be thinking about their futures and not worried about losing their lives
5649459 we want to keep them safe and help them avoid catastrophic tragedies like the one we experienced in new jersey it is important to arm them with all of the information we can so students and their families can make informed choices as to which colleges and universities are safest

5649466 all quotes attributed to me on imao are made up including this one
5649467 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and he did despair for in his omniscience he did know that his creations had but three fifths of the splendor of that which would be imao
5649468 the environmental movement is naturally opposed to the overweight and what we mean by

5649485 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
5649486 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
5649487 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
5649488 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
5649489 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
5649490 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
5649491 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
5649492 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5649493 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5649494 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
5649495 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
5649496 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
5649497 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5649498 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5649499 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5649500 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5649501 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
5649502 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
5649503 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
5649504 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5649505 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5649506 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5649507 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5649508 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5649509 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5649510 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5649511 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
5649512 there is safety in information parents and students need to know that college campuses are doing all they can to keep students safe we must take every step possible to prevent a tragedy like the seton hall fire from ever happening again i am glad our bill is now law so we can finally give the public the information it needs to evaluate fire safety at colleges and universities
5649513 i am pleased that our work to close a dangerous public safety loophole at college campuses all over the nation has finally paid off if these common sense fire safety disclosure requirements were in place years ago lives may have been saved and perhaps fewer families and classmates would have experienced the horrific shock and pain that overwhelmed the seton hall community in 2000
5649514 college students should be thinking about their futures and not worried about losing their lives
5649515 we want to keep them safe and help them avoid catastrophic tragedies like the one we experienced in new jersey it is important to arm them with all of the information we can so students and their families can make informed choices as to which colleges and universities are safest
5649516 these department of education grants will help maines educational system expand its services to improve literacy rates in local schools and enhance academic opportunities in rural areas

5649520 president musharrafs leadership in the war on terror should be praised his resignation is a testament to his countrys dedication to democratic progress which will help move us towards ending violent extremism in the region

5649523 will consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
5649524 we hope our republican colleagues will join in a bipartisan effort not only to increase domestic supply but also to help consumers and to protect the environment
5649525 alaska has been hoping and dreaming for a natural gas pipeline for decades what it took was getting off the dime and creating a competitive market in alaska
5649526 theres been a great response already to the letter but frankly every senator should sign on because its irrational to say no to proven american energy during this energy crisis
5649527 the united states has 2 trillion barrels of oil shale
5649528 this is more than seven times the amount of crude oil reserves found in saudi arabia and is enough to meet current u
5649529 the u s could completely end its dependence on opec by 2020
5649530 even a moderate estimate of 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil from oil shale in the green river formation is three times greater than the proven oil reserves of saudi arabia
5649531 if oil shale could be used to meet a quarter of that demand the estimated 800 billion barrels of currently recoverable oil from the green river formation could last for more than 400 years
5649532 is roughly equal to the daily production rate of just one new offshore platform in the gulf of mexico
5649533 access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030
5649534 many people arent aware that the bans on drilling must be renewed every year and all we have to do is allow these prohibitions to expire on october 1 in just 50 days americans will have the freedom to pursue their own energy resources here at home our letter is very straightforward we will actively oppose any effort to extend the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale
5649535 this funding for the value added agriculture development center will continue support for emerging technology renewable energy and native american business opportunities
5649536 one of the pillars of my hometown prosperity plan is investing in the public good and this funding is a wonderful example of that kind of investment
5649537 the national forest lands of the united states are an abundant source of biomass capable of producing billions of gallons of renewable fuels this poorly crafted definition of renewable biomass in the energy bill unfortunately blocked us from using forest waste in national forest lands for renewable fuels this law should be modified so we can use this abundant source and further move our country toward energy independence
5649538 thinning materials from national forest land could provide up to 318 million tons of biomass and help reduce the risk of wildfire i would much rather that our country support the creation of a biofuels industry using the biomass from our forests than depend on middle eastern nations for our energy security
5649539 i want to thank senator thune for holding this important field hearing

5649545 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
5649546 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
5649547 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
5649548 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

5649562 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
5649563 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

5649617 i look forward to advising boris on an ongoing basis on transport
5649618 i have concluded however that it would not be appropriate for an unelected official to chair a body which is responsible for most of the money and a large part of the brief of an elected mayor
5649619 i also agree with the mayor that my position as adviser does not justify my full time and exclusive commitment to the greater london authority or the title of first deputy mayor
5649620 transport for london is responsible for a huge range of transport policies that impinge directly on the lives of londoners and i was delighted when tim parker agreed to take charge of the board on my behalf
5649621 over the last few weeks however it has become increasingly apparent to both of us that the nature of the decisions that need to be taken are highly political and there is no substitute for me as the directly elected mayor being in charge
5649622 to lose one advisor is unfortunate to lose two is careless but to lose three in four months shows the wheels are coming off this new administration
5649623 why is boris losing yet another advisor has tim parker discovered that running london isnt as easy as running private business
5649624 in addition to being mayor he says he wants to chair the police authority transport for london and the new waste authority additionally having delegated his planning powers he recently took them back
5649625 he needs to find some competent deputies to share his responsibilities instead it looks like they are fighting like rats in a sack

5649644 we have been using the recycled green waste compost on our own farm for many years and have seen massive benefits
5649645 at a time when people are increasingly aware of their carbon footprint using compost and mulch produced as a result of recycling wood and green waste that could otherwise have taken up precious landfill space is a great solution its good for the environment and for the business bottom line
5649646 we have started to sell our compost and mulch in bulk to local farmers and businesses we have already supplied some landscape gardeners and individuals with large garden projects i hope that as our compost and mulch products become more widely known the public sector will take the opportunity to boost their green credentials by buying back both the compost and mulch that has been created from the wood and green waste collections within their districts in effect completing the recycling circle
5649647 we incorporate fertility building into our rotation but where situations exist that inputs are required the soil associations sourcing list is quite limited
5649648 we have spread the green waste companys compost on 25 acres in march which will accommodate a range of crops produced for the multiple sector as well as the organic box scheme that we operate
5649649 w j oliver amp son is pleased to be able to support another thriving local business and to find a good cost effective alternative to the mineral fertilisers which is produced here in cornwall
5649650 we have already ordered further compost to spread on another 46 acres for winter cauliflower and are particularly looking forward to analysing the soil in 12 months time to compare nutrient levels before and after compost application and cropping in the soil

5649653 he reversed into the road rather than going round the block and coming in the other way like the rest of us have to
5649654 i went home and got my camera i took a photo of the van and then a picture of the officer through the window of the chip shop
5649655 he came running out smashed the camera from my hand i was put in handcuffs and he said i had assaulted him with my camera and that i was also being arrested for resisting arrest and being drunk and disorderly
5649656 this was complete nonsense they bundled me into the back of the van i offered to delete the photos but the male officer was having none of it
5649657 i know that pc farooq apologised personally to you but i would also like to add my apologies on behalf of avon and somerset constabulary

5649660 i am told he realises his actions were totally unacceptable and he could and should have apologised to you much earlier

5649712 eight years have lapsed since the pullout from lebanon and with it the arrival of numerous sla fighters who assisted the israeli army and who are presently complaining about inequality in their absorption in israel
5649713 the protesters feel betrayed by the defense ministry which they believe abandoned them after many years of service
5649714 we are fighting now in order to live as we should we cant do this
5649715 i came here eight years ago with my husband and children we were in the sla we had true peace with israel after the israeli military pullout from lebanon we didnt know what to do they neglected us
5649716 we came to this country and we know that people receive all their rights here for eight years they didnt know how to absorb us like they should have they divided us
5649717 we reached a point where a lot of people arent working and we cannot continue living this way because it is really hard
5649718 we are asking for equality what is happening now is unjust we worked with the defense ministry not with the ministry of immigrant absorption and they threw us out like dogs

5649801 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
5649802 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
5649803 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
5649804 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
5649805 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
5649806 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence

5649859 what i said was unfair to john comitis after what he has done for me all these years
5649860 i joined ajax as a 15 year old and the club has always been good to me if i had a problem with the club i should have approached comitis and not run to the media first now i think i need to be honest with myself and face my wrong doings by apologising to the club
5649861 after the article was published i went through what i said word by word and when i read it i realised what i said was harsh and uncalled for i spoke out of anger after failing a trial in holland and unfortunately what i did was wrong but now its time to leave the past behind and focus on the forthcoming season

5649875 beton bietet mit seiner hohen temperaturspeicherf higkeit ideale voraussetzungen um in b ro und handelsimmobilien energie einzusparen und damit die co2 emissionen zu reduzieren
5649876 man vergisst oft dass f r die k hlung eines geb udes die gleiche energiemenge ben tigt wird wie f r das heizen wir m ssen daher beides als notwendig bereitzustellende energie sehen
5649877 f r unternehmen die sich in einem b rogeb ude einmieten spielen aufgrund der steigenden energiepreise die laufenden betriebskosten neben der reinen miete eine immer gr ere rolle aus diesem grund wird f r projektentwickler in hinkunft die lebenszyklusbetrachtung ihrer geb ude nicht nur ein ko m ntelchen sein k nnen sondern eine rein betriebswirtschaftliche notwendigkeit werden m ssen
5649878 99 prozent der erde sind hei er als 1000 grad celsius damit hat geothermie das gr te technisch nutzbare potenzial aller erneuerbarer energieformen und ist nahezu emissionsfrei
5649879 f r die bauwirtschaft bleibt noch viel zu tun wenn wir lernen das geb ude als gesamtsystem zu betrachten und das optimierungspotenzial nutzen das die zusammenf hrung einzelner bausteine wie geothermie und bauteilaktivierung mit anderen innovationen auf dem gebiet der bautechnologie bietet dann wird daraus jenes umweltfreundliche bauen und wohnen entstehen das der klimawandel und die steigenden rohstoffpreise erforderlich machen
5649880 investitionen werden noch nicht fl chendeckend ber den gesamten lebenszyklus bewertet
5649881 offensichtlich war und ist der wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftspolitische druck zu gering um mehr energie in die entwicklung eines intelligenten geb udes zu investieren

5649905 das war meine bitterste lektion ich hoffe dass ich selber daraus lerne und das sollte jeder von uns tun jeder muss sich selber fragen ob er wirklich alles gegeben und alles hintenangestellt hat
5649906 seit nahezu zw lf jahren haben ich immer wieder angemahnt dass junge spieler gef rdert werden m ssen

5649925 ahora tenemos docentes que se paran frente a los alumnos sin saber qu hacer
5649926 a esta altura quien est frente a un alumno debe estar capacitado y contar con un t tulo que lo respalde
5649927 no se trata solamente de aumentar horas a la carrera sino de darle al magisterio una base cient fica y disciplinaria
5649928 hasta ahora tenemos docentes que egresan y se paran frente a 45 alumnos sin saber qu hacer porque con el actual sistema seguimos sin entender lo que los chicos de hoy realmente necesitan
5649929 los futuros docentes adquirir n las herramientas necesarias para lograr el aprendizaje de los alumnos s que algunas maestras aplican el m todo de evaluaci n a libro abierto eso implica una capacidad innovadora del docente que ayuda a que el chico piense razone relacione y use los recursos que tiene a su alcance para responder y solucionar problemas
5649930 es correcto que el ingreso sea asistido con entrevistas y cursos de ambientaci n yo le agregar a apoyo psicol gico porque el docente as como el ni o ingresa a la escuela con innumerables problemas que pueden convertirse en barreras dif ciles de superar
5649931 hasta ahora cualquier persona estudiaba para maestro para muchos era una alternativa si fracasaban en el ingreso la universidad para otros la forma de asegurarse un puesto de trabajo pero la realidad indica que hay 15 000 docentes desocupados y otros tantos estudiando magisterio

5649945 wir m ssen es schaffen l ndern mit wertvollen waldresourcen durch finanzielle anreize eine alternative zur kurzfristigen profitmaximieriung wie abholzung zu geben
5649946 am tag als die neue regierung das ausfuhrverbot f r holz bekannt gab waren wir alle bergl cklich

5649953 i havent got a clue to be honest with you i havent played many games recently so i honestly cant say
5649954 there is a big squad there and everyone is fighting for their place and i just have to train well and take the chance if i get it
5649955 you would have to ask the club i have been trying to get into the team
5649956 i havent played but i will just wait and see and when the transfer window closes we will know then
5649957 i will wait and see if i can get into the team if not then obviously i want to play so we will just have to take it from there

5649962 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5649963 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5649964 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5649965 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5649966 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared
5649967 like children who learn a new language more easily than adults so too did the cats and dogs learn their new language more easily the younger they were
5649968 an analogy can be drawn with homes in which a dog is adopted either before or after a baby is born when the dog enters a home with a baby in residence the status quo is already in place however when the baby is born after the dog has become accustomed to a certain amount of attention and the focus now turns to the newborn child the status quo is altered and the dog will often display behaviour resembling jealousy
5649969 recently an extreme form of linguistic determinism has been revived which claims that counting words are needed for children to develop concepts of numbers above three that is to possess the concept of five you need a word for five
5649970 however our study of aboriginal children suggests that we have an innate system for recognizing and representing numerosities the number of objects in a set and that the lack of a number vocabulary should not prevent us from doing numerical tasks that do not require number words
5649971 in our tasks we couldnt for example ask questions such as
5649972 do these two sets have the same number of objects
5649973 they had to use an abstract representation of for example the fiveness of the bangs and the fiveness of the counters
5649974 thus basic numerical concepts do indeed appear to depend on an innate mechanism this may help explain why children in numerate cultures with developmental dyscalculia find it so difficult to learn arithmetic
5649975 although they have plenty of formal and informal opportunities to learn to count with words and do arithmetic the innate mechanism on which skilled arithmetic is based may have developed atypically
5649976 theres a difference between nitrogen species going into the leaves and that process being useful
5649977 he doesnt want to leave hes happy here at valencia and i wouldnt want him to go its a joy to have a person like him in the dressing room
5649978 bakkies is obviously a big player for them and he and victor matfield have been an important part of their gameplan but theyre not losing too much with bekker who is an outstanding player
5649979 he is very athletic carries the ball well and is a good lineout jumper i know there are fears you lose some physicality without botha but springbok sides always get stuck in and saturday will be no different
5649980 i have been contacted by people on behalf of clubs but i have told them if they are interested they have to agree a fee with villa
5649981 three clubs have asked if he is available because they want to talk to him but they have to come to an agreement with martin oneill first
5649982 aston villa havent accepted a bid from anyone so unless that happens i will do nothing
5649983 if villa accept a bid then the final piece of the jigsaw will be for me and maloney to discuss a move to that club
5649984 das kubanische bildungssystem befindet sich seit jahren in der krise sowohl materiell als auch personell

5649989 stellen sie sich vor wie sich ein teenager gegen die alkoholabh ngigen eltern eines siebenj hrigen durchsetzt alles klar

5649992 the all blacks have some great tactical kickers so in a sense we had to slow the game down last week

5649994 i think fourie does have a yard or two on ricky other than that i dont think theres much difference between the two
5649995 the decision to omit danie rossouw was on behalf of the player
5649996 juan will cover there if needed but at the moment we have two locks ready to play 150 mins eighty might not be enough
5649997 as for our fetcher did you guys ever consider that we would not lose so many balls if we commit more players to the breakdown
