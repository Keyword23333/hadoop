5350000 i wasnt alone we had appraisers from all over the nation writing in and urging them to take action
5350001 resulting from inappropriate pressure being placed on real estate property appraisers to hit a certain value
5350002 people who say we should have done more dont understand how the system works
5350003 agencies just dont lobby to change things we had no interest in doing anything like that it just wasnt our area
5350004 good position to work with bank regulators and others on the problem
5350005 everything related to the issue went into a black hole why i just dont know
5350006 i tried to push but nobody wanted to hear what i was saying
5350007 problem appraisals are being allowed and in some ways even encouraged by a regulatory structure that promotes lax enforcement and ineffective oversight
5350008 we are here to alert congress that the licensing system it created for appraisers is broken and needs to be fixed
5350009 but states dont have the money to hire personnel to carry out what the system was designed to do
5350010 may have been rude or said my house wasnt worth as much as i thought
5350011 just because youre disciplined that doesnt make you a bad appraiser
5350012 i may have done some technical things wrong but ive done a good job im proud of my work
5350013 why should he get super zapped for doing a lot of little things that a lot of other appraisers are doing every day but havent had complaints turned in on them
5350014 the name waikoko springs is the only remnant of traditional practices that once existed
5350015 the significance of the updated wahi tapu therefore relates to the presence of the original source of the water rather than the extraordinary formation of a manmade lake
5350016 weve told them we are not interested in being part of any process
5350017 we have made no formal approach to the council and as far as im concerned they have no claim on anything around here
5350018 it sounds fishy because i bet if the governor wanted to increase everyones salaries 10 percent i cant see the controller saying he cant do it

5350020 our current forecast shows stabilization of sales during the second half of this year followed by solid recovery in 2009 and beyond
5350021 it is a good sign that two out of three of the component indexes rose in august and this may be an indication that we are nearing the bottom of the long downswing in new home sales
5350022 builders are counting on some support from this new first time homebuyer tax credit
5350023 though first time home buyers generally buy more in the existing home market than in the new home market new homes get a ladder effect from the existing home market
5350024 i dont think that he i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation
5350025 we should probably trade him so he can go play for a contender
5350026 sweet lord baby jesus why are good kickers so hard to find
5350027 he just feels like he knows how to coach you know
5350028 it just felt like i have felt in every other race i have done in the last year and a half nearly i shouldnt complain but im here to paddle fast and im struggling to do that
5350029 adam likes to get out strong and command the race and thats not something that im physically set up for so i was always happy to concede a certain amount but he probably took a little bit more than i would have liked
5350030 i didnt have a backend of the race so when i wanted to lift which is normally the strength of my race it was not there i just felt heavy and tired and didnt feel strong at all
5350031 i would say i would be paying about 58 bucks for a medal at the moment i going pretty average
5350032 i came through and won the world championship very quickly and everything else i had been working very hard for a long period of time but my time on the actual sprint scene was very short
5350033 if you guys are going to run stuff and run every lie under the sun have somebody stand up for somebody
5350034 im sorry that the storys not interesting but its about time that somebody stands up for that girl and i think shes great
5350035 earlier on we had an issue as to whether wed get through winter but its now more of an issue of getting through spring
5350036 you are hanging by on the grace of the single circuit dc link i accept it is unlikely but things happen snowfall could knock a transmission tower down
5350037 were not there there are lots of steps that can be taken before we do that
5350038 the generators are concerned about the south island storage of course it is late in the year but what we can do about that of course is make sure we are getting as much dc flow on the cook strait cable because we are awash with water in the north island
5350039 it means our dependence on thermal power will carry on right through to the summer
5350040 it further highlights just how dependent we are on thermal generation when things get tight
5350041 but on the positive side of the ledger there is an awful lot of snow when temperatures warm that will be a very useful addition to the storage position
5350042 spring is when we start to get our main inflows through snow and rain its just a question of when it happens
5350043 lord im sorry to question your wisdom but my faith has been wavering wont you show me a sign and let me know that youre listening
5350044 its hard to explain but its this there is so much joy in what we do up here

5350049 sustainability has always been important to fairchild but it is becoming even more important as we try to do our part in reducing our climate impact and our consumption of energy and water
5350050 fairchild is the power franchise we provide products that help consumers reduce power consumption in electronic applications and we feel it is our duty to actively pursue our own sustainability and green business practices
5350051 todays commercial kitchens are being squeezed by high operating costs driven by energy prices and a reduction in discretionary spending by consumers
5350052 our customers wanted a way to reduce their operating costs while becoming more ecologically responsible which in turn would make their establishment more appealing to patrons the program we developed allows our customers to achieve these goals while putting them further down the path toward other types of certifications

5350082 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance

5350113 ha hecho cuatro goles en ocho partidos que son pocos pero tienen m s puntos que nosotros es un equipo al que no le convierten goles sac resultados positivos ante argentina y brasil que es una cosa muy importante y ha empatado afuera algunos partidos
5350114 es un rival duro directo y el resultado de este partido va a deparar muchas cosas que esperemos sean positivas

5350124 the tao of oil energy path not as green as we think
5350125 still runs on oil and will for a long time to come
5350126 we cant drill our way out of oil shortages but we also cant green ourselves out of a paper bag
5350127 the boring reality is that alternative fuels for all their promise would account for even less than the small contribution they now make were it not for government subsidies prevailing political winds which would increase to hurricane strength if obama wins and has a filibuster proof congress would take money from big oil and transfer it to big green including gores 35 million hedge fund

5350239 son francos impetuosos impresionables eminentemente inteligentes les gusta mucho exhibirse pero son tremendamente inconstantes lo cual es el resultado de una excesiva vanidad no se parece esa a una descripci n de los norteamericanos la mayor a del mundo estar a de acuerdo con eso
5350240 porque os doy testimonio de que si hubiera sido posible os habr ais sacado vuestros ojos para d rmelos
5350241 lobos disfrazados de piel de cordero se hab an introducido entre ellos ciertos judaizantes hab an descendido de jerusal n predicando lo que pablo llama un evangelio diferente no porque fuese totalmente diferente sino por ser una perversi n del verdadero evangelio
5350242 pero a n si nosotros mismos o un ngel del cielo os anunciara un evangelio diferente del que os hemos anunciado sea anatema
5350243 si alguien os est anunciando un evangelio contrario al que recibisteis sea anatema
5350244 puesto que tienen tanto celo que se empe an en que llev is alguna marca en vuestra carne dice me gustar a que hiciesen las cosas a fondo y se castrasen a s mismos
5350245 gracia a vosotros y paz de parte de dios nuestro padre y del se or jesucristo
5350246 porque yo recib del se or la ense anza que tambi n os he transmitido que el se or jes s la noche en que fue entregado tom pan y habiendo dado gracias lo parti
5350247 yo recib del se or jes s cuando pedro jacobo y juan se dieron cuenta de que este hombre sab a tanto acerca de lo que suced a en el aposento alto como ellos reconocieron que all estaba un hombre que hab a sido verdaderamente llamado por dios y su apostolado se basaba en ese hecho
5350248 se entreg a s mismo por nuestros pecados jesucristo hab a pagado el precio l mismo no hab a enviado a un ngel
5350249 no pongas la fe en ti mismo sino en las heridas de cristo
5350250 esp ritu del universo encontraremos por fin el camino de la paz
5350251 g latas insensatos sois unos ingenuos cre is que pod is comenzar en el esp ritu y luego continuar carnalmente y de ese modo expresar vuestra profesi n pues os digo que todo es por la fe y es por el poder de dios que debemos vivir la vida cristiana
5350252 galacianismo aunque no es muy factible que se nos pida que nos circuncidemos ni que observemos el shabat
5350253 con cristo he sido juntamente crucificado y ya no vivo yo sino que cristo vive en m lo que ahora vivo en la carne lo vivo por la fe en el hijo de dios quien me am y se entreg a s mismo por mi
5350254 yo ha sido crucificado con cristo por lo que ya no tiene ning n derecho a vivir y su labor y la m a es asegurarse de que no viva que sea repudiado dejado de lado juntamente con su determinaci n a expresar lo que pablo llama
5350255 fornicaci n impureza desenfreno idolatr a hechicer a por cierto la hechicer a es una palabra relacionada con los temas farmac uticos incluyendo las drogas como la lsd y otras sustancias psicod licas enemistades pleitos celos ira contiendas disensiones partidismos envidia borracheras org as y cosas semejantes a stas de las cuales os advierto como ya lo hice antes que los que hacen tales cosas no heredar n el reino de los cielos
5350256 los frutos del esp ritu que son vers culos 22 23
5350257 amor gozo paz paciencia benignidad bondad fe mansedumbre y dominio propio contra tales cosas no hay ley
5350258 mirad con cuan grandes letras os escribo con mi propia mano
5350259 no quiero gloriarme en vuestra carnalidad como lo hacen estos judaizantes que les encanta obligar a las personas a circuncidarse creyendo que todo el que se circuncida es otra cabellera que se pueden colgar del cintur n como una se al de haber hecho algo grandioso para dios
5350260 me glor o en la cruz de cristo que elimina esa clase de vida la corta de ra z eliminando al
5350261 no se le ocurra a ninguno de vosotros escribirme para decirme que estoy equivocado en lo que os estoy diciendo porque quiero que sepais que el llevar esa clase de vida tiene un precio y me he ganado la persecuci n de muchos llevo en mi cuerpo las marcas del se or jes s
5350262 a mi no me importa porque me glor o en el se or jesucristo que me ha ense ado lo que es la verdadera libertad lo que significa ser un hijo del dios vivo y llevar una vida de libertad y de gozo gracias a haber conocido a jes s

5350265 call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with
5350266 i pray that you may prosper and be in health
5350267 and i pray god your whole be preserved blamless without defect unto the coming of our lord jesus christ
5350268 in everything i did i showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak remembering the words the lord jesus himself said it is more blessed to give than to receive and in 2 corinthians 9 7 the apostle paul tells us
5350269 each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver
5350270 salom n amaba a jehov y caminaba en los estatutos de su padre david solo que sacrificaba y quemaba incienso en los lugares altos
5350271 da pues a tu siervo un coraz n que sepa escuchar para juzgar a tu pueblo y para discernir entre lo bueno y lo malo porque qui n podr gobernar a este pueblo tan grande
5350272 debiendo ser ya maestros por el tiempo transcurrido de nuevo ten is necesidad de que alguien os instruya desde los primeros rudimentos de las palabras de dios
5350273 cortad el beb en dos mitades y dad una de ellas a una mujer y la otra mitad a la otra mujer
5350274 pero el rey salom n am adem s de la hija de fara n a muchas otras mujeres extranjeras moabitas edomitas sidonias y heteas
5350275 de los pueblos que jehov hab a dicho a los hijos de israel no os un is a ellos ni ellos se unan a vosotros no sea que hagan desviar vuestros corazones tras sus dioses a estos salom n se apeg con amor tuvo 700 mujeres reinas y 300 concubinas en la mayor subestimaci n de la realidad de la biblia y sus mujeres hicieron que se desviara su coraz n
5350276 porque donde est vuestro tesoro all tambi n estar vuestro coraz n
5350277 porque salom n sigui a astarte la diosa de la sexualidad diosa de los sidonios y a moloc dolo detestable de los amonitas salom n hizo lo malo ante los ojos de jehov y no sigui plenamente a jehov como su padre david entonces salom n edific un lugar alto a quem s dolo detestable de moab
5350278 y a moloc dolo detestable de los hijos de am n otro dios de la fertilidad en el monte que est frente a jerusal n
5350279 dios le levant un adversario en contra de salom n primero fue hadad el edomita que representa al hombre carnal luego se nos dice en el vers culo 23
5350280 dios tambi n le levant un adversario como adversario a rez n hijo de eliada quien hab a huido de su se or hadad ezer rey de soba
5350281 tambi n jeroboam hijo de nabat servidor de salom n efrateo de zereda que despu s habr a de dividir el reino de manera que estos adversarios se reunieron para derrocar a salom n y conseguir su derrota
5350282 repos con sus padres y fue enterrado en la ciudad de david lo cual representa el colapso de su gloria y de la majestad de su reino
5350283 queremos tener un dios al que podamos adorar como lo hacen las otras naciones
5350284 les ped que trajesen todo su oro todos sus pendientes y sus joyas cog todo ese oro lo ech al fuego y de l sali de buenas a primeras un carnero
5350285 jeroboam el hijo de nabat que hizo que pecase israel en este caso no es un carnero sino dos es el mismo pecado multiplicado doblado en su intensidad y en su poder el que introduce jeroboam en la vida de la naci n
5350286 y sucedi en el quinto a o del rey roboam que subi sisac rey de egipto contra jerusal n y tom los tesoros de la casa de jehov
5350287 y los tesoros de la casa del rey todo lo tom
5350288 se or ya he tenido suficiente qu tame la vida pero como es natural eso no lo dice en serio

5350293 there is an opportunity here to address a pressing need our residents need to feel safe when a man gets stabbed in the chest for confronting people throwing rocks at his car there is something wrong because there doesnt seem to be a fear of repercussion yonkers residents need to know that the criminals do not perceive this as some type of recess or signal for lawlessness to take over we need to ensure police services are restored in a fiscally responsible way
5350294 many of the residents in my district have complained that the police presence noted around election time last year has decreased significantly

5350299 they had been moving to avoid having edwards speak at this months national party convention even before his admission
5350300 any role for edwards in a potential obama administration is dead
5350301 its a very very fragile balance of powers right now
5350302 but the fact that commodities are declining is overall good for consumers and good for the market
5350303 what about you were seeing russia reasserting itself in georgia and maybe now poland whats happening
5350304 the centuries old ambition of the russian empire to dominate that part of the world
5350305 you go to georgia and you see these old churches that go back to the fourth and fifth century
5350306 but leadership is critical and im interested in hearing what a new international platform for the u s might be
5350307 character through what they mccain and obama say on the issues
5350308 who are the three wisest people you know in your life and who are you going to rely on heavily in your administration
5350309 who are three wise people on whom you will rely in your administration
5350310 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than their self interest
5350311 i know that my job is to tell them that ill be the president of every american and ill always put my country first
5350312 you know i remember what my mother used to tell me
5350313 i was talking to somebody a while back and i said the one time that shed get really angry with me is if she ever thought that i was being mean to somebody or unfair to somebody
5350314 i think i have the ability to build bridges across partisan lines
5350315 to get people to work on some common sense solutions to critical issues and i hope that i have the opportunity
5350316 answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5350317 i came here today not being a fan of mccain but hearing what i heard today he made a convert out of me i think he gave very precise very decisive answers
5350318 i think were blessed to have two good candidates they both seem to be men of integrity principle and so forth but i tend to favor john mccain im more impressed with obama as time goes on hes a smart man but he lacks experience id like to see a real leader in there the presidency sometimes older people who have answers and opinions who are strong are really important to americans at a time when the country is really in a stressed condition
5350319 this was an eye opener to the leadership abilities on the line answers direct without a lot of thought i saw such a big difference in the candidates one has a lot of charisma and at one point in time i was certainly committed to vote for him and i think today really opened my eyes because there was not any dancing around with mccain and id rather have as our president someone who is direct who knows how to make a decision or knows where to go for the answers i was quite taken with obama in the beginning his words his charisma and his change perhaps his time will come but i dont think hes seasoned enough to be a leader in the times were living in right now
5350320 the benefit to society could be in excess of 2 trillion
5350321 since the cold war ended the united states has been pushing the buttons of russian frustration and paranoia by moving ever further into moscows former sphere of influence and we have rarely stopped to consider whether we were overreaching even as evidence mounted that the patience of a wealthier and more assertive russia was wearing very thin

5350374 fluoride lowers thyroid function fluoride damages the bone and fluoride lowers iq all of these have been demonstrated in india and china
5350375 theyve brought together six top experts who have carefully looked at all of the details and they have come to a very clear result that there is not a link that would suggest fluoride is going to cause the problems that some people would suggest
5350376 the fluoride gets incorporated into the enamel of the tooth at the time that the tooth is forming so this makes a stronger coating on the tooth which is more resistant to decay right from the very start
5350377 cases of deformities in children are escalating at an alarming rate in fallujah
5350378 this new brain research together with the nrcs evidence of fluorides against use of fluoridated water in infant formula as well as the withdrawal of their fluoridation support makes a strong case for ending this 60 year old fluoridation experiment
5350379 its apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain
5350380 the weight of evidence thats on the table now says that on a precautionary basis we should stop this practice fluoridation
5350381 the majority of dental professionals surveyed were unaware of the current understanding of fluorides predominant posteruptive mode of action
5350382 no child is or ever was fluoride deficient in fact the u s centers for disease control tells us that 1 3 of u s school children are fluoride overdosed causing dental fluorosis white spotted yellow brown and or pitted teeth its time to stop fluoridation

5350424 esta semana ser de poco volumen y muy vol til dada la coyuntura negativa de la econom a global
5350425 hemos vivido momentos de euforia con los futuros de eeuu en positivo y temores que nos han llevado a la baja de la mano de fannie mae y freddie mac
5350426 cuando salen noticias negativas en el sector financiero a nivel mundial entran los miedos y la presi n vendedora
5350427 una semana con escasas referencias macroecon micas y de no haber sorpresas si el crudo se mantiene a estos niveles podr a haber un rebote de las bolsas
5350428 siempre y cuando nos deje el sector financiero porque los bancos pesan mucho y tumban a los ndices
5350429 no parece que ser una semana trascendente para las bolsas
5350430 la morosidad y las previsiones han sido lo que ha mirado el mercado en las publicaciones de resultados de las compa as
5350431 en todos los bancos la morosidad ha repuntado de niveles m nimos del 0 5 muy bajos en comparaci n con la media europea a niveles del 1 5 1 6 dependiendo de la exposici n que tienen las entidades al cr dito inmobiliario y al cr dito promotor
5350432 la t nica va a seguir as la ralentizaci n econ mica es m s patente
5350433 el eur bor est a unos niveles que hace recortar el dinero disponible para afrontar los cr ditos
5350434 tendremos un trimestre de poca renta disponible y de aumento de la morosidad
5350435 una reducci n de beneficio en todo el sector financiero que lo har mal en los pr ximos trimestres
5350436 el mercado descuenta el riesgo de su exposici n en latinoam rica
5350437 al estar ligados a las materias primas se han visto favorecidos por el ciclo alcista de stas
5350438 una sobreponderaci n de todo el ibex 35 en general por su exposici n en latinoam rica y de los dos grandes bancos en particular
5350439 a esto le a adimos el tema de venezuela que ha metido miedos jur dicos en relaci n al sector financiero todo se complica
5350440 entre bbva y santander matiza el analista recomendamos santander porque brasil tiene unos fundamentales m s s lidos y una econom a menos vinculada a la norteamericana
5350441 pensamos que no es momento de tomar posiciones aunque santander lo haya hecho mejor que el sector a nivel europeo y podr a llevar a cabo una operaci n corporativa aprovechando la debilidad del sector
5350442 si el mercado se pone alcista va a tirar fuerte
5350443 ha habido cierres de posiciones cortas en valores ligados a la construcci n y ferrovial ha sufrido mucha volatilidad
5350444 creemos que si el mercado se pone alcista tirar porque la refinanciaci n es una buena noticia y la posible venta de alg n activo le dar a un bal n de oxigeno a la compa a

5350455 i think were looking at the last generation of consoles theres not going to be an xbox 720 or a ps4 ill make that bet not going to happen
5350456 im the guy who talked microsoft into the console business in the first place
5350457 i made several observations about the console business and why it would be strategic for microsoft at that time whats interesting is that the assumptions that got microsoft into the game business are also reasons why i think consoles may be at an end
5350458 the first is that from a consumers point of view the console is an enabling game service thats not correct a console is a game disabling experience the consoles job is to prevent you playing games you didnt pay for the principal reason that sony and microsoft get a cut of everybodys games is because they prevent piracy this allows the publishers to invest more money in a game because they can be confident that it wont get stolen and will have to be paid for at a premium in a world where that is a driving factor affecting the economics of a game you need a console in a world where games are mmos massively multiplayer online or community based that cant be pirated i dont need a drm digital rights management console any more
5350459 the era of consoles defined by graphics and high production values is over
5350460 sony and microsoft took the bet that prettier graphics would be the huge differentiating feature for their consoles they were wrong everybody expects things to look good so making it look 10 per cent better doesnt have a big impact on its value since thats changed we now live in an era where community defines the value of a game not production values so the community dynamics of an mmo are more valuable to a user than how good the graphics look
5350461 nintendo recognised that it wasnt production values that differentiated a game but community and a proprietary input control a new type of gameplay mechanic differentiated by control
5350462 this is something that happened at the end of another gaming era the arcade business died off when consoles came along and matched them for graphic capabilities it destroyed that differentiator for the arcade business the only arcade machines you can find left today are ones based on big input controllers which are expensive to put into the home dance pads steering wheels guns

5350608 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5350609 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5350610 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5350611 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5350612 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children

5350659 no one likes war war is a horrific affair bloody and expensive sending our men and women into battle to perhaps die or be maimed is an unconscionable thought
5350660 yet some wars need to be waged and someone needs to lead the citizenry and congress are often ambivalent or largely opposed to any given war its up to our leader to convince them thats why we call the leader commander in chief
5350661 after a few quick victories things started to go bad there were many dark days when all the news was discouraging casualties began to mount it became obvious that our forces were too small congress began to drag its feet about funding the effort
5350662 many who had voted to support the war just a few years earlier were beginning to speak against it and accuse the commander in chief of misleading them many critics began to call him incompetent an idiot and even a liar journalists joined the negative chorus with a vengeance
5350663 as the war entered its fourth year the public began to grow weary of the conflict and the casualties
5350664 without his unwavering support the war would have surely ended then and there in overwhelming and total defeat

5350669 were hoping to finalise this hes young but has a good background
5350670 this signing will give us a more experienced spine to the side
5350671 the profile of the german muslim youth has been changed visibly their expectations towards their local communities their parents and also towards their society have been changed likewise but dangers increase on the other hand if you neglected those young people there might be a possibility of ending up in drugs violence and crime we are not able to address all the masses but we rather have to deal with the youth personally individually and locally
5350672 but even if muslim students are informed about their religion by means of regular islamic teaching in the state schools this would be only a small contribution to the religious identity of young muslims
5350673 dont try to twist your identity in order to please others
5350674 generally we can say that there is a return movement toward islam especially among the youth you will be able to notice this not just in our mosque but also in the other mosques there are more and more young people who are interested in islam i have the feeling that this is because of previous inefficiency of the german programs in the mosques this has led to indifference from lots of the young people toward the mosques because they do not speak enough turkish or arabic in comparison with the first generation
5350675 we have to announce that the majority of the brothers and sisters who are discussing islamic topics through the internet do not have the required knowledge of islam
5350676 these new religious entrepreneurs oppose the philosophy and regionalism that are usually linked with traditional islam they contrast this mindset with a middle class market oriented cosmopolitan and active religiousness
5350677 although barack obama remains a slight favorite in this election his position is more vulnerable than at any point since the primaries concluded and he no longer appears to have a built in strength in the electoral college that we had attributed to him before
5350678 mccain now rates as slightly more likely to win the electoral college than the popular vote a reversal of the trend apparent for most of the past couple of months
5350679 caroline and georgina are an incredible example of what determination and hard work can achieve
5350680 we gave them the freedom of the city last time its hard to beat that but two in a row we have to honour that
5350681 y bueno pues obviamente el chofer cay en la trampa seguramente les abri y se los llevaron
5350682 es terrible es el delito m s cobarde que hay
5350683 bueno el momento nunca lleg pero nunca me imagin nunca me imagin que ya hab a sido brutalmente asesinado
5350684 yo no me imagin que hubiera estos niveles de maldad en nuestro pa s y esto no te dice otra cosa m s que nuestra moral se ha venido degradando enormemente y nosotros entendimos que la muerte de nuestro hijo ten a un sentido muy importante que nos trazara a nosotros un futuro de lucha para mejorar a nuestro pa s yo siento que fernandito es hoy un hijo de m xico quiz yo lo pierdo como hijo pero el pa s en su conjunto con su indignaci n le ha dolido como si fuera su propio hijo yo creo que a veces los grandes males nos traen grandes mensajes
5350685 yo creo que yo creo que en la sociedad civil hay indignaci n en mucha autoridad hay verg enza en esto hemos sido copart cipes no hemos exigido la sociedad civil y nuestros gobernantes se han descuidado todos los ciudadanos tenemos una indignaci n existencial
5350686 tenemos que eliminar la impunidad que es en este pa s es total y eso invita bueno exhorta a la delincuencia si nosotros asumimos nuestra responsabilidad y capturamos a las gentes que delinquen los metemos a la c rcel con honestidad y con valent a se va a acabar la impunidad la gente va a tener un riesgo va a tener un costo por hacer algo malo ahorita el costo es gratuito te sale mucho mejor salir a secuestrar que formar una empresa o comprar un taxi

5350689 guys are trying to get used to each other especially in the preseason weve got guys rotating in and out so much youre hardly ever next to the same guy i think thats part of it thats why you play preseason games to get the timing down
5350690 its a little bit of both having new guys in new positions and getting used to the technique and executing your blocks
5350691 at the same time the other team is making plays we have to make and finish plays rather than allow them to get into the lanes were supposed to keep them out of
5350692 right now we kind of have an idea whos going to be out there were trying to roll some guys in including some of the younger guys who we may not have seen in a game setting
5350693 i was thinking about running before i even made the catch
5350694 im thinking about everything you cant do nothing without the ball im trying to make a play instead of focusing on little things
5350695 the most important thing on offense is to secure the ball first whether it be a handoff catching a pass or fielding a punt
5350696 as far as special teams ive never done it i want to go out and prove to myself that i can do it
5350697 special teams is all about effort its a one play kind of situation
5350698 you dont get to line up on second down and remake anything special teams requires you to go 100 percent
5350699 watching the films what i see is a lot of guys here learning the system working to get into place
5350700 its preseason right now and its trial and error were going to get better by the time the season comes
5350701 the lanes on the punt returns you have to be patient back there im seeing some lanes but it seems hard to get to them but im going to stay patient and work on it
5350702 i know they are great fans but there are also people i will say for a minute that i read message boards and got caught up in that whole thing
5350703 that even put more stress on me just worrying about what people thought about me people say a lot of times i dont care what people think about me me personally i dont care how people perceive me when they look at my hair but i like people to think great things about shawn andrews but you cant please the world

5350718 there arent too many people with three medals in three olympics
5350719 and the statistics dont do it justice those are just numbers look at the way the athlete behaves how they set a good example for determination for other athletes ive been her coach for 17 years
5350720 i just started this sport for fun it wasnt even an olympic sport and i went to three games and now i have a third medal you know its all hard to believe its amazing im still trying to soak it all in
5350721 back in october i thought id make it to the games i injured myself two weeks before the worlds championships which was the sole qualifier for the games back then i didnt know how i was going to qualify then i came through the surgery and made it back in time
5350722 thats why this means so much to me im really proud of what i did and how i pulled through
5350723 the afghans did not go to canada to kill canadians rather it is the canadians who came to afghanistan to kill and torture the afghans to please the fascist regime of america
5350724 as a terrorist organization they target innocent aid workers their own civilians and they are involved in some of the worst forms of violence that weve seen
5350725 they saw the artificial lights and took the wrong route
5350726 the diners were at first quite curious and then someone alerted the coastal authorities
5350727 our greatest desire is to maintain a consistent testimony for christ in all of the issues of life and in this circumstance we feel that a strong spirit of cooperation best accomplishes this
5350728 its not about the money i do what i do because i love it and thats why im here
5350729 i see myself as a normal person and the same kid i was four years ago so im just living a dream right now
5350730 michael phelps is leaving beijing as a global sports icon hes now with the likes of the michael jordans tiger woods and roger federers and hes earned every bit to be in that elite company
5350731 this absolutely changes the game the values will change the depth of the programs he is involved with will change the breadth of these programs will change
5350732 you cant compare the platform he has now to anything that any swimmer has had in the past
5350733 he has worked to develop promotional platforms that can exist between the games irrespective of whether there is a competitive event
5350734 i think he can make swimming much more than a once every four year sport in terms of relevance to the general public
5350735 if the strategy works with each of these platforms and business engines are fuelled this amounts over time to arguably exponential growth in efficiency and in value
5350736 ed note sometimes its hard to hear music as described

5350773 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5350774 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5350775 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5350776 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5350777 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5350778 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia

5350826 for the better part of a century punishing retailers for selling at cut rate prices was an automatic violation of antitrust law however a supreme court ruling last year involving handbag sales at a dallas mom and pop store kays kloset upended that original 1911 precedent potentially altering the face of u s discount retailing
5350827 more than 75 of waste that goes into landfills comes from businesses food waste and food contaminated paper make up nearly 30 of that total
5350828 in portland alone this equals about 54 tons of food and food contaminated paper waste per year that can be eliminated from our landfills
5350829 we are pretty environmentally minded here so composting seemed like the right thing to do but without assistance it was messy workers didnt like having to wash out the composting containers everyday and frankly we had no place to take the food to be composted or a way to haul it ourselves the citys program now makes it easy
5350830 currently there is no local composting facility that can handle this amount of food waste we have to ship it up to maple valley in washington which causes concerns that we are using quite a bit of fossil fuels in the process thus negating the environmental benefits of the program

5350841 ok well somewhere between the bulb and the ground you have a small short can you shine a light up under the quarter panel and see anything wires or scraped up insulation
5350842 youll have to chase the wires its sort of a pain
5350843 reach up and find the wires one will go down into the main set of wires that runs all the way to the dash and then there might be one that runs away from the socket and goes somewhere else it would be that one they used to wire the whole rear end your car in series so that wire has to go somewhere
5350844 yeah ok it runs over to the side to the little marker light
5350845 real strong awesome man that was it what does that mean

5350940 importantly the broader deal with a search and non search components could have a higher probability of clearing regulatory hurdles in our opinion instead of denying a stand alone search deal on the basis of googles dominant search market share the regulators will be forced to evaluate this broader advertising deal where no single company enjoys a significant market lead

5350992 walking on dead fish is a great example of the kind of movie that would slip through the cracks if released in a rote fashion

5351033 you are calling the press conservative are you kidding me the same press that has annointed obama the next president the same press that sent the top three news correspondants with him on his mideast trip but yet when mccain went to south america he might have gotten a reporter from a high school newspaper to cover it
5351034 you mention edwards dilema it is kinda funny that his own democrat friends seem to be his most harsh critics and the edwards story just broke but mccains infidelity happened 30 years ago

5351224 my suspicion is that for most people its not a positive image at its extreme worst ive heard many people describe governance as a slow painful process that requires investing significant time preparing for a review by people who are out of touch with what a project is trying to do that ultimately results in the reviewers flaunting authority the project team taking their lumps and then everybody goes back to doing what they were doing with no real change in behavior other than increased animosity in the organization
5351225 when governance gets discussed people naturally assume a command and control structure
5351226 if you are an in a position of authority a policy setter and or enforcer you must keep the lines of communication open with your constituents and help them to set policies change policies that are doing more harm than good and understand the reasons behind policies if you are a constituent you need to participate in the process
5351227 governance should be as helpful and as automatic as possible if it is a hurdle if people have to do stuff theyve never had to do before it typically produces a bunch of resentment and people will figure out ways to avoid it

5351282 what we have seen is they us play extremely hard on the defensive end they are very unselfish they always find the open guy and they also shot the three point very well

5351290 the tragic deaths of conor james black in manchester and nilanthan murddi in croydon show why the work of the action program is so important if you carry a knife you are now more likely to get caught more likely to be prosecuted and more likely to go to prison if found guilty
5351291 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve enforcement action is only one part of the solution i am pleased that later today the england football team will be supporting our marketing campaign it doesnt have to happen urging young people not to carry knives
5351292 i want to reinforce our commitment to tackling knives and getting them off our streets working with the police local authorities the health service and partners like the fa well do all we can to protect young people their families and communities from the fear and grief of knife crime

5351300 i think that would be a good start that would be fantastic if that was to happen
5351301 kids would be thinking this is a big chunk of my life taken out
5351302 i will never forget the day that the headmaster brought the school to a halt and said stephen was killed the night before it was a crazy atmosphere in school very sombre and chilling
5351303 something like that really does hit home one day he is enjoying life talking about doing an art a level and the next day he is gone
5351304 with the number of knife carriers out there it only take one to cause a problem
5351305 im delighted the fa and the england team are supporting our campaign warning youngsters about the severe consequences of knife crime
5351306 you can only solve this by working together the england players are role models for this generation and i hope their messages have a positive impact
5351307 i want to reassure the public that we the government the police and local authorities are doing all we can to tackle knife crime and to get knives off our streets

5351347 i do not want to keep saying this but nobody is going to be leaving the club
5351348 we want to keep our best players be it santa cruz warnock or mccarthy and any one of a dozen players

5351350 i love it here the club wants to sign me and there wont be any problems on that front i just want to concentrate on my performances and play well because its not nice for the fans to have an ongoing thing but i will be a chelsea player for the rest of my career
5351351 the reality is that we think and the manager thinks that if august 31 comes and we are what we now then we have a squad
5351352 we think robinho is the right age and brings some difference to the squad it would add to the squad but were not going to win or lose this season because we have or havent got robinho
5351353 i am competing with other people in the squad and you want to play well
5351354 when you get the chance you have to produce and thats always the case at this club

5351356 i know i have to step it up again football is a game that doesnt stay still i performed well last season and the fans voted me player of the year but thats all in the past now

5351385 i would like to cite article 20 of the slovak constitution which says that something can be expropriated in the public interest if they continue and this is not only about enel but about the position of foreign owners of power monopolies to make policies that go against state policy against the interests of this state and its people we will not hesitate to use also such extreme tools

5351463 once the relationship is developed you can almost replace one another because youre thinking along the same lines all the time
5351464 public relations is a service for the entire organization and has to be its voice
5351465 thats why public relations should have unfiltered access to the ceo
5351466 it was very clear early on that bob was going to rely on human resources and communications as two strategic organizations to drive this culture transformation
5351467 i have always worked closely with communications especially internally during such events as acquisitions and mergers
5351468 i was initially puzzled as to why the reaction was so negative because i was sitting in all the meetings and i am a director who reports to the ceo
5351469 you dont spend 30 years in the detroit auto industry without some sensitivity about how a specific policy action will be taken from an external or government or retiree standpoint
5351470 theyre the ones who have the gut instinct and the connections
5351471 like any head of a function i dont do it alone and wont do it alone we have wonderfully talented people but im not the boss who sits with her feet up on the desk and says give me a report on friday im a very hands on boss
5351472 voluntarily gone from the majors to the minors to do a job he could do before nine oclock
5351473 human resources is a reflective discipline can it react quickly enough to crises can public relations under human resources support lobbying efforts can it deal with activists on things such as environmental matters
5351474 its a private company dealing with public issues and its the external environment that dictates how you operate
5351475 the external environment is such that you need a sharp pr department ready to deal quickly with many issues hr is not the place to do that the two cultures are very different
5351476 the staff here is working 24 7 whether its a crisis or not
5351477 we have a very talented team here many with 20 years or more of experience in the business they havent missed a beat
5351478 clearly being private is not being silent and i think our track record from december has shown that were anything but that
5351479 but its very important for me as a reporter and editor to find out whats really going on when i make a call
5351480 pr people are most effective when they report directly to the ceo because they are plugged in most of the time they can speak for the company without having to run to someone else to find out whats going on effective pr people are not just a mouth they are also eyes and ears they pay attention to whats going on
5351481 years ago the chrysler pr person reported through a vice chairman not the ceo
5351482 gm had public relations reporting through a lawyer they were not good days dealing with general motors at ford they just changed ceos and the public relations goes through marketing which isnt much better it gives the appearance that the company doesnt value that line of communications
5351483 our reporters are a little frustrated because there is no transparency
5351484 when chrysler was a public company it needed to file and disclose some things it was translucent now it can be as opaque as it wants to be its partly attributable to chrysler being privately owned and partly a change in attitude that says we no longer need to put as many resources into public relations
5351485 for pr people to be effective they need to be at the table in real time and know what the issues are
5351486 show me an organization that has pr reporting into hr and ill show you an organization where the ceo has not seen the value in what pr can deliver
5351487 i didnt think i could add value to a pr pro
5351488 i had people who had been doing it their entire careers i had been doing it for five minutes so i gave them an enormous amount of latitude and positioned myself as an internal support and advocate of my pr people when things got tough i stepped out of the way and let the pr head deal directly with the ceo
5351489 it isnt a smart move and its a mistake too many companies are making
5351490 when youre asking your pr team to be the voice of the company or youre trying to control the brand through public relations and marketing you must have one voice hr might be full of wonderful people who know a little about a lot in their organization but they dont know what public relations is and dont have the capacity to cope with crisis situations
5351491 they know what slings and arrows are being fired at the company and they know that because they monitor blogs newspapers and other news media
5351492 this is all part of reputation management and neither human resources nor marketing can control a companys external reputation
5351493 communications organizations that report directly to the c suite either the chairperson of the organization the chief executive or the chief operating officer consistently enjoy higher budgets relative to organizational gross revenues and greater control of the enterprises broader communication activities
5351494 when an organizations pr teams do not report to the c suite the results almost uniformly are diminished overall budgets and reduced cognizance of reputation considerations
5351495 if you took 100 hr people and said i want you to take responsibility for public relations my guess is that youd get a high percentage saying yes
5351496 if you said id like you to take over the controller or research and development function my guess is that you would get the opposite reaction but there is something about pr where most people around the company think i can do that its a mistake
5351497 when the headhunter calls and tells you the position reports to the chief marketing officer or human resources you should say no thank you
5351498 if enough good people do that the headhunter will go back to the company and say hey im not getting the best here because they want to report to the ceo theres got to be push back
5351499 pr people take umbrage at being pushed aside but quite often they get what they deserve because too many of them are too willing to go into a job with a tell me what to say and ill write it for you attitude they should be saying im an equal partner here and i can contribute to your strategy go in without making that clear and you get what you deserve a job writing press releases so the message is go fight for your rights

5351504 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5351505 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5351506 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5351507 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5351508 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say

5351516 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5351517 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5351518 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5351519 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5351520 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia

5351532 we booked it up a cliff in 10 seconds and we just saw this massive rush of water rage down the creek side

5351539 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5351540 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5351541 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5351542 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5351543 it wasnt like i got second by three tenths or five tenths i had the same score thats what makes it a little harder to take
5351544 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging you do your routine and you turn it over to the judges thats what weve been going through our entire lives and weve come to accept it
5351545 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5351546 shes done her hard work and her preparation she definitely deserved her gold medal
5351547 i play by the rules so in my opinion i have to say yes
5351548 judges have their own opinion and once you land your dismount theres nothing else you can do
5351549 i have the most important medal and its the all around gold

5351588 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice

5351671 as mentioned in another gtx 280 reviews if this card was reviewed a few weeks earlier the overall thought process on the card would be completely different but thanks to the recent price drop the gtx 280 really begins to resemble a bit of value for money whats going to be interesting now though is what amd do with the hd 4870 x2 this card could really shake the gtx 280 up a bit its going to depend on a lot of things though like price availability and of course performance like most companies gigabyte havent done a whole lot with the gtx 280 but their pricing is competitive and they offer an extra years warranty over some off the cheaper brands which for some people is a plus it would have been nice to see a game bundled with the card but really we have everything we need to get up and running if you find yourself looking for a gtx 280 that follows the reference mould at a good price the gigabyte gtx 280 is a good option if you find yourself wanting a bit more power and dont really want to spend any more money take the time to download a free program like rivatuner and overclock the card yourself for some free fps or 3dmarks you cant really go wrong with a reference designed gtx 280 with that said you cant really go wrong with the gigabyte one

5351681 infectious diseases create an enormous burden on the worlds population from both a human suffering and an economic development perspective
5351682 one of the major challenges we face in stopping infectious disease outbreaks is predicting how control strategies such as vaccines will work by using computer models to conduct epidemiology in silicon we will be able to test the impact of new candidate vaccine technologies and select the most effective strategies
5351683 many infectious diseases are preventable by simple vaccination yet children in poor countries die of these diseases because they lack access to vaccines
5351684 by providing computer models to aid in decision making we will support efforts by the gates foundation and other partners to make vaccines safer and easier to administer and ultimately protect more children and adults against deadly infectious diseases

5351696 ive always been a fan of racing games and working on need for speed undercover was an amazing experience
5351697 i was so impressed by the scope and quality of the overall production that goes into a videogame these days it was like any other day on a hollywood set i felt right at home the black box team is doing tremendous work here and i cant wait to see the final game
5351698 de instelling heeft ook te kennen gegeven dat de manier waarop zij hierover heeft gecommuniceerd met cli nten en familie tot onrust heeft geleid
5351699 ik kreeg het gevoel dat je je als 70 plusser schuldig moet gaan voelen als je ervoor kiest om gereanimeerd te willen worden
5351700 het reanimatiebeleid moet bijvoorbeeld zijn besproken met bijvoorbeeld de cli ntenraad en de verpleeghuisarts
5351701 ik heb met zo veel mensen samengewerkt in mijn leven nu focus ik me meer op heel onbekend talent mensen van 17 en 18 die nieuw zijn en fris daar focus ik me nu eigenlijk veel meer op dan op mensen die al heel erg bekend zijn
5351702 er zijn altijd mensen geweest die mij een kans gaven omdat ze me als een talentvolle jongen zagen en ik vind het leuk om ook weer iets terug te geven ik denk ook dat het goed is goed voor je karma

5351707 das war nichts anders als eine zusammenfassung aller versprechen die schaeffler in den wochen zuvor gemacht hatte
5351708 da standen punkte drin die klar gegen das deutsche aktiengesetz versto en
5351709 die wollten dass wir die waffen strecken und dann nackt in den verhandlungen gehen

5351715 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5351716 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5351717 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5351718 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5351719 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5351720 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5351721 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5351722 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5351723 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5351724 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5351725 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5351726 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5351727 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5351728 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5351729 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice
5351730 israel has crossed a red line by deciding to release the perpetrators of murders against israelis
5351731 the heart of our trouble is with our foolish alphabet

5351733 people who spell a lot of words incorrectly either arent paying attention or dont care
5351734 why are we changing our language to accommodate with two ms them

5351746 were all rednecks up here we dont carry it around as a badge of shame we carry it around as a badge of honour
5351747 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5351748 deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghan border but clearly on our side of the border too

5351768 i saw a plane travelling east coming down sharply straight towards the woods
5351769 i immediately thought it looked like something was wrong then at the last minute just 50ft up the pilot managed to pull up the nose of the plane it looked like he was trying to save the plane from the trees but then i realised that the plane was going down and it disappeared into the woods

5352036 six russian armored vehicles are heading from khashuri towards sachkhere and another six towards borjomi
5352037 if someone thinks they can kill our citizens kill soldiers and officers fulfilling the role of peacekeepers we will never allow this
5352038 anyone who tries to do this will receive a shattering blow
5352039 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries
5352040 oh yes the kmt wants us dead chen shui bian is their no 1 enemy
5352041 if chen shui bian were dead president ma ying jeou would not have to do anything and would easily get elected it doesnt matter that his approval rating is as low as 1 percent or he sells out taiwan to china
5352042 it is ok that i die but i cannot die for nothing
5352043 before i die i want the public to know who took the money
5352044 do you think it was legal to keep it here
5352045 do you think that would work if you ask around people will tell you they always use figureheads
5352046 if i had that much money i could have just stayed home why do i have to work so hard
5352047 the control yuan will investigate any crimes or malfeasance committed by government officials but we must discuss how and when we should intervene in the investigation of this case
5352048 former president chens case involves not only the former president but also the former director general of the ministry of justices investigation bureau yeh sheng mao and may also involve other government officials
5352049 those who have helped chen with his bad deeds should also be brought to justice
5352050 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5352051 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5352052 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more

5352055 theres no way the average american was saving 40 of their salary toward college funds in the first place
5352056 storytellers can take their audience to another time and another place
5352057 i have wanted to learn to surf for a long time and when i saw the opportunity i grabbed it
5352058 seventeen years ago there were maybe two or three american surfers six people sharing the beach was considered a crowded day
5352059 back then there were only a few local boys the surfing scene in taiwan has definitely changed
5352060 its the surfing lifestyle that is attracting the young people the surfing equipment industry in taiwan is also pumping up the excitement and most all surfing is fun relatively easy to learn and not that expensive
5352061 clothing manufacturers made a big push into taiwan some are pure surfing brands op ripcurl oneill stussy billabong while others are just outdoor manufacturers that also include a surf line reef etc tied together with the media promoting surfing as a cool sport as well as a general liberalizing of the youth as can be seen at local night spots
5352062 it is rare to find a lifeguard on beaches and even if you see one they are often not properly equipped
5352063 but most importantly you must learn to first understand and respect the ocean
5352064 the surfers must be in harmony with the waves the wind the board and most of all with yourself sic you must be physically mentally and emotionally balanced so you can be focused and centered
5352065 the locals feel theres a need to protect their local turf this tends not to be a problem if you remain courteous and adhere to surfing etiquette which is the same around the globe i have seen some small skirmishes that were calmed once the non local apologized after all this is still taiwan and the face issue still exists
5352066 over the past few years the coast guard has been actively issuing warnings and tickets to those who defy warnings to surf during typhoons after the government has issued official typhoon warnings
5352067 hey its more fun to live on the edge right
5352068 we will definitely look into the matter to see if liu committed any administrative error it might be too harsh to call it a punishment but if he is found guilty of any wrongdoing we will take the necessary action in line with the law on discipline of civil servants
5352069 it would be a reasonable deduction to say that liu never mentioned anything about the swiss request when he was in taipei last month
5352070 to prevent potentially embarrassing protests inside tibet china has turned large parts of tibet into a virtual prison for the duration of the games
5352071 many should feel ashamed of their groundless accusations once they know what the chinese government has done for ethnic minorities
5352072 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5352073 many problems have not been solved not even by the united nations and some want them to be solved during the olympic games putting pressure on the international olympic committee and the beijing olympic committee
5352074 this is not realistic we think that you do not really understand chinas reality
5352075 to prevent potentially embarrassing protests inside tibet china has turned large parts of tibet into a virtual prison for the duration of the games
5352076 many should feel ashamed of their groundless accusations once they know what the chinese government has done for ethnic minorities
5352077 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5352078 i dont remember much but the girl in front of me crashing and then looking and seeing bikes everywhere i stood up and immediately started to cry i couldnt move my elbow
5352079 minutes before i was almost taken out in another crash and i was making my way back to the front
5352080 when something like this happens you have no control because it happens so fast i usually drive carefully to avoid this i had no choice
5352081 my coach joel filliol was there and i said i wanted to continue he asked me to try to move my elbow i tried once more and couldnt so i knew i was done
5352082 there is nothing worse than not finishing i wouldnt have cared if i finished last with a broken arm but i needed another arm to climb those hills today
5352083 it has been such a trying year with injuries for me
5352084 i had a solid six weeks of training coming into the olympics i had the swim of my life today and i thought i could have had a top 10
5352085 i was prepared for the heat in the run and bike but not the water which was really warm and that told the day for me
5352086 it was tough but this is the olympics and it is supposed to be tough
5352087 i think thats why the feeling of accomplishment must be so much greater for those who are on the podium today
5352088 the process of office greening consists of observing what nature tells us and then trying to apply that information in the context of a modern law office
5352089 i had the good fortune to spend a lot of time the first six years of my life on a farm
5352090 to confirm a lot of things id observed but wasnt able to articulate
5352091 there are things that most people would be upset with if they noticed like locking dogs in wired cages slapping children around or having road lamps turned on in daylight the problem is that people just dont
5352092 one of the prime indicators is that we are consuming like americans we are a superpower when it comes to waste and overconsumption
5352093 i havent used an air conditioner for years in my home im trying to never buy anything new again and i dont own a car
5352094 the greening process include s paying colleagues as much as we can afford being completely open about firm finances and providing opportunities to develop or move to different positions within the office
5352095 you ask me why i care about the environment so much but im surprised whenever i talk to people outside the environmental field
5352096 why isnt the issue of the environment obvious to everyone
5352097 prosecutors asked her chen chun ying to admit doing things she did not do and refused her request to have lawyers present during the questioning
5352098 prosecutors asked her to admit doing things she did not do and refused her request to have lawyers present during the questioning
5352099 the moj is expanding its legal assistance with several countries the ministry not only has cooperated with swiss authorities to investigate chens accounts there but it has also contacted singapore the us and other countries where the former first family had allegedly wired funds
5352100 i offered legal documents involving chen and the former first family to swiss prosecutors to assist in their investigation into suspected money laundering and i also expressed the hope that switzerland would return the money to taiwan
5352101 the ministry and failed bidders could lodge lawsuits if the auction turned out to be tainted
5352102 it would be up to the court to settle the dispute no one can predict the outcome
5352103 people who played unfairly would not be able to shake off their legal responsibility
5352104 they would be unfit to chair the company but the companys dealings would probably remain unaffected
5352105 there are great differences between the past and now what the public wants now is not war but a bridge between taiwan and china
5352106 the policy which is irresponsible in nature has caused the economy to bleed and seriously hurt the country
5352107 we hope to find the dishes that can best represent taiwan through the reviews by the experts
5352108 but we are under pressure to supply more fresh water in the near future
5352109 we gave conditional approval to the original plan on condition that the company would stop pumping groundwater the company must not violate that condition
5352110 suddenly screamed for no reason and began shaking and would not eat or drink
5352111 i have never seen such a big rally in srinagar
5352112 i couldnt resist coming out to demand freedom from india
5352113 to intervene and help us in achieving the right to self determination
5352114 dat doe ik thuis wel aan de dokter had het z druk
5352115 mevrouw wat doet u hier eigenlijk met uw kleren nog aan
5352116 frankly we dont expect anything at all out of his visit
5352117 he wont be able to make the regime deviate from its roadmap
5352118 the only way to break the deadlock is to persuade the nld to run in the 2010 election and to ask the regime to make it as free and fair as possible
5352119 hes the only one with the experience strength and knowledge to save us from sinking
5352120 i have not achieved what i wanted to because what i want is to win a major tournament that is what we all want
5352121 if i did not win that i would regard my england career as a failure we have to try and win a tournament and we have to try and put that right next time
5352122 it was hard to watch euro 2008 this summer but we have to put that behind us now and concentrate on the next campaign
5352123 any time you get disappointments in your career you use them as motivation to succeed but we do not want to live in the past
5352124 someone is trying to cause trouble because nothing could be further form the truth
5352125 sure it takes a little time to settle when you move clubs and i am still living in a hotel but that is my choice because i want to find the right house for me and my family
5352126 we hid in the bushes at the back of our house until 1pm today
5352127 i am very pleased to carry on as club captain this season
5352128 it was my first season as captain last year and although i am 31 now i am still learning
5352129 i really enjoyed the responsibility last season everyone could see that and i tried to do the best job i possibly could
5352130 it was a really positive experience and this season i have to use that and carry on doing my best for the team
5352131 i know a lot more about the job now thanks to last season
5352132 its difficult to put into words what it felt like
5352133 its what ive been working for ever since i joined this club so it was great to get out there
5352134 prefiero alejarme de conversaciones pol ticas lo m s posible prefiero hablar de plumas y piedras preciosas no me gusta hablar de cosas que enfaden a la gente
5352135 it takes both sunshine and rain to make a rainbow
5352136 if russia threatens poland then we poles have the right to feel threatened
5352137 but this type of statement from russian generals is a problem for all of nato and i expect the alliance to take a stand on this
5352138 after the construction of the road the number of trekkers will be reduced we have a trade off here between economic development and infrastructure and the effect on tourism and the environment we need to create alternative attractions to just trekking
5352139 we are trying to create man made tourism attractions like theme parks adrenaline sports like bungee jumping and rafting
5352140 will mainly go to a few specialized tour operators and some more expensive hotels
5352141 although there will be some trickle down of profits for the majority of the local people these activities will have little effect on alleviating poverty
5352142 there will be buses and tractors and lorries churning out their choking fumes all day and all night is this the way we want to treat our planet
5352143 this is a rarity there have been past thefts in the history of the mbta but we have security measures in place which quickly identified this individual and he was placed under arrest
5352144 he has no record hes presumed innocent hes not guilty of any crime at this time
5352145 i heard that theres freedom of religion in china so why is there a problem for us to bring bibles
5352146 we dont want to go without taking those books it cost us a lot of money to bring them here
5352147 theyre saying that its illegal to bring the bibles in and that if we wanted to we had to apply ahead of time for permission
5352148 we must maintain thorough preparations as there is always the possibility of a limited conflict with north korea
5352149 steadily attempt to promote an ideological rift in south korea we should be fully prepared for that
5352150 are aimed to ignite a new war on the korean peninsula and stifle the dprk north korea by force of arms
5352151 i have a sincere principle that north korea should quickly open and build economic self reliance in the international community
5352152 what i found out is that combustion generated particles contain environmentally persistent free radicals
5352153 when the radicals are associated with particles they can apparently exist indefinitely
5352154 the implication is you can have the same environmentally related diseases by exposure to airborne fine particles that you can get from cigarettes
5352155 these airborne free radicals are of interest but i am not sure we are at a point where our scalpel is sharp enough to dissect the individual components of air pollution that cause problems for people
5352156 there are studies that show that modifying free radicals can alter the course of disease
5352157 but the implications of this what it means to clinics what it means to doctors what it means to regulators i think we are a long way from pulling that together
5352158 oh no i must stop the monster before he levels my lilacs
5352159 i am not an animal i am a human being
5352160 regardless of a difference of opinion it is unacceptable that those who are involved in whaling get injured or face life threatening dangers
5352161 save afghan lives defeating the enemies plan to discredit the afghan government
5352162 we recommend to all afghans to be vigilant at large public events and other locations where crowds gather and report suspicious behavior to security forces
5352163 all the time the enemy tries to carry out any kind of activity that it can but the afghan security forces are ready and we have already taken measures to disrupt any enemy activity
5352164 i am an author and am totally against plagiarism but the use of personalities which are already in existence is common
5352165 i have used many characters from the past in my books and i have never had a problem but after this i will never write again about tintin
5352166 note international orders are subject to additional handling charges higher shipping rates and applicable customs duties and taxes all of which are the responsibility of the customer
5352167 people in these remote areas live in the bottom of valleys which is very dangerous
5352168 the only place they can grow rice is on the table land at the bottom when storms come in from a typhoon flash flooding happens very quickly
5352169 lets really allow the people of zimbabwe to determine their future
5352170 the gap between the parties is narrower points of disagreement are not so wide
5352171 the parties still are far from each other though on one point and that is the executive powers that should go to the president and the prime minister that is the stumbling block
5352172 it is critical that we conclude these negotiations very soon i hope that wise counsel and wisdom will prevail we are fully and firmly committed to the process of dialogue
5352173 we had received information that we would be targeted by groups within azamiyah and within the awakening movement itself
5352174 the iranian development and testing of rockets is troubling and raises further questions about their intentions
5352175 heinonen has traveled to tehran to continue previous talks about the trend of cooperation between iran and the agency
5352176 they train us and they expect us to rely back on that training then when we use that training they prosecute us for it
5352177 i didnt do anything wrong i dont think i should be the first tried like this
5352178 this boils down to one thing in my mind are we going to allow civilian juries to monday morning quarterback military decisions
5352179 from a legal point of view there is no difference in law between war and peace
5352180 i am more determined than ever to fight to clear my name
5352181 there are two sides to every story and i guarantee that will come out in the end
5352182 i can honestly say i am absolutely relieved now that there is clarity going forward and i now know what im up against
5352183 shes not interested in talking about it now its a police matter weve got nothing to say anyway
5352184 while both of these members are clearly grandstanding in a vain attempt to revive flagging popularity and impending obscurity this is a serious matter and should be treated as such
5352185 from the outset let me declare that i reject any claim of contempt of parliament the facts simply dont support the claims which have been levelled
5352186 the assertion that i knowingly breached standing orders by not disclosing the situation of multi millionaire owen glenn paying legal costs does not make sense the blunt fact is there is and was no debt
5352187 one of the unsung heroes out there is adam whitelock
5352188 for a young man like him still a colt to step into casey laulalas shoes and do what hes doing he makes the busts defends like a trojan and he does it without fuss
5352189 im enjoying it and learning off the senior guys and picking up a lot of useful stuff each week
5352190 tim sort of gets into half gaps which makes it quite easy to run off him hes pretty evasive and pretty skilful in terms of getting offloads and putting people into holes
5352191 hes pretty uncomplicated and hes a real student of the game so he works really really hard on and off the field and hes done the simple things well
5352192 while we would like to see farm gate returns improve more this will be a vast improvement on the previous season which is on record as the lowest sheep and beef farm profit in at least 50 years in inflation adjusted terms
5352193 you know i think you scheduled it on graduation day on purpose
5352194 like i said graduation day is nothing but a bus station moment all that waiting it finally gets here you get on for the ride and then you just cant wait to get off
5352195 graduation is maybe the kind of bus you dont want to miss
5352196 i know you wont try to kill him on purpose
5352197 just remember roxanne it cant always be about tomorrow sometimes its about right fucking now
5352198 public health interventions targeting adults with vision problems without health insurance might be more beneficial if they focused on those at risk for serious vision loss especially those in the lowest income group
5352199 a public health gap exists in actual access to eye care services between canada and the united states primarily owing to the population without health insurance in the united states
5352200 something could happen these plants can spread and you wont be legal
5352201 hey bob yeah im just cloudin with some clients be with you in a sec
5352202 we have an impressive cloud infrastructure and our services can allow anyone to become more cloudy
5352203 this is a stand alone model and not simply an estate version of the saloon in fact all the bodywork aft of the b pillars is unique to the sports tourer weve also ensured that its design combines the sculptural artistry and technical precision found in the saloon and hatch models
5352204 i think that presidents deserve to be questioned perhaps irreverently to bring them down a size
5352205 ive been umming and ahhing yesterday it was no but this morning it was yes
5352206 but im thinking that you know im alive and just need a bit of a challenge ive missed coaching ive missed making a difference i want to put in to see what could be
5352207 given so many opportunities to be the best coach i can be
5352208 i think i should be imparting my knowledge and skills
5352209 i honestly reckon greg henderson and hayden are dark horses in the madison theyve been there or thereabouts so hopefully they can get a medal i reckon its their best chance
5352210 i was like a lot of kiwis and switched over to the rugby
5352211 so i didnt see the interview until the next morning
5352212 come through a lot of controversy with his health problem
5352213 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5352214 its incredible the lord has blessed us with antibodies our whole lifetime
5352215 i had my leg under the hurdle instead of on top
5352216 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5352217 i will remain faithful to the nation and my countrymen and promise in the name of the people that i will remain faithful to the sovereign nation of nepal
5352218 i think it is ridiculous that the opposition looks at everything as having a political motive
5352219 the truck was carrying around 60 people it overturned as it was crossing a bridge on the river glace in southwestern haiti
5352220 an upscale version of a north korean group calisthenics performance
5352221 overly large with too many people involved and was devoid of content and human nature
5352222 the most tacky opening ceremony in the history of the olympics
5352223 russia has no legitimate security interests justifying its advance beyond the boundaries of south ossetia and abkhazia its advances and attacks raise real doubts about russias intentions with respect to georgia and appear aimed at undermining georgias capacity to function as a state
5352224 russias threat of a nuclear strike against a u s defense system in poland crosses a dangerous line
5352225 how to raise your parents is brilliant i wish i had a guide like this when i was a teenager its a terrific book clever and funny and honestly helpful without being condescending or fake
5352226 this book tackles difficult topics with wit and wisdom it speaks honestly and openly to teens about the challenges of being an adolescent in todays world
5352227 a wise and witty work for smart teenage girls the result should be that both parent and teen feel they can be heard and respected even where there is disagreement
5352228 clutching a piece of paper with a friends address on it
5352229 in sickness and in health for as long as no pesky cameramen get in the way
5352230 i just want to say congratulations and i am really sorry you didnt invite me to your wedding
5352231 not to get your hopes up about we just thought it would be fun to make a really shitty looking cgi movie that would continue to erode the fond memories you have of the last good thing i did about 30 years ago
5352232 to hanging it all up and just riding the rails with a song in his heart
5352233 earlier on we had an issue as to whether wed get through winter but its now more of an issue of getting through spring
5352234 you are hanging by on the grace of the single circuit dc link i accept it is unlikely but things happen snowfall could knock a transmission tower down
5352235 were not there there are lots of steps that can be taken before we do that
5352236 the generators are concerned about the south island storage of course it is late in the year but what we can do about that of course is make sure we are getting as much dc flow on the cook strait cable because we are awash with water in the north island
5352237 it means our dependence on thermal power will carry on right through to the summer
5352238 it further highlights just how dependent we are on thermal generation when things get tight
5352239 but on the positive side of the ledger there is an awful lot of snow when temperatures warm that will be a very useful addition to the storage position
5352240 spring is when we start to get our main inflows through snow and rain its just a question of when it happens
5352241 last year was not a great year for our shareholders
5352242 if you owned 100 of shares on april 1 2007 you would have had that value reduced to 83 50 by march 31 this year
5352243 not only is infratil in a sound financial position it has invested in sectors which are in the main not adversely impacted by either the world wide credit difficulties or general adverse economic circumstances
5352244 resulted in a lot more people flying a lot more frequently
5352245 they asked me where are the boys i said my sons were away they took everything from my house turned it upside down and left
5352246 my generation grew up during the second world war now im old and im in a war again
5352247 there were bodies everywhere i saw two dead women from my village lying on the ground everything was on fire
5352248 we were fighting to defend the people of south ossetia and i am proud of that
5352249 i want to complain about the one sided reporting from the west your reports are not correct they are not right the west has been reflecting only the georgian point of view
5352250 its perfectly obvious georgia of course and its not the first time either
5352251 this saakashvili bloke its clear hes just an american puppet
5352252 thats how i see it either hes sick or hes evil the way hes treated russia
5352253 i expect this to happen within a couple of days
5352254 i saw a soldier on the street i assumed he was georgian and asked him in georgian for a light he turned round and spoke in russian
5352255 the landscape is beautiful but we also have big mountains in dagestan
5352256 my husband died 14 years ago i wish id died soon after him i cant walk any more
5352257 my generation grew up during the second world war we were always crying it was a terrible situation
5352258 the idea is to punish georgia and the georgian government and misha saakashvili they hate misha
5352259 you cant be a responsible member of institutions that are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbors
5352260 russia has been all the time testing the reactions of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
5352261 it was almost as if the democrats had gone from merely appealing to graduate students to nominate one
5352262 it clearly promotes homosexuality and its message is shameful and disgusting katy knows how i feel we are a very outspoken family
5352263 i cant even listen to that song the first time i heard it i was in total shock when it comes on the radio i bow my head and pray
5352264 there used to be 31 restaurants from nostrand avenue to knapp street along emmons avenue now theres three
5352265 its hard to do business when you are surrounded by empty lots
5352266 the bays changing in a lot of ways and im not sure its always for the better
5352267 we would stay open until 4 a m on the weekends and 3 a m on the weekdays people love to talk at night and wed be here for them
5352268 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5352269 this gentleman knows this about himself and is in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5352270 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5352271 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5352272 what makes shows go off the rails is they forget who they are were a crime mystery forensics drama
5352273 is it not pleasant to learn with a constant perseverance and application
5352274 is it not delightful to have friends coming from distant quarters
5352275 is he not a man of complete virtue who feels no discomposure though men may take no note of him
5352276 they are few who being filial and fraternal are fond of offending against their superiors there have been none who not liking to offend against their superiors have been fond of stirring up confusion
5352277 the superior man bends his attention to what is radical that being established all practical courses naturally grow up filial piety and fraternal submission are they not the root of all benevolent actions
5352278 fine words and an insinuating appearance are seldom associated with true virtue
5352279 i daily examine myself on three points whether in transacting business for others i may have been not faithful whether in intercourse with friends i may have been not sincere whether i may have not mastered and practiced the instructions of my teacher
5352280 to rule a country of a thousand chariots there must be reverent attention to business and sincerity economy in expenditure and love for men and the employment of the people at the proper seasons
5352281 a youth when at home should be filial and abroad respectful to his elders he should be earnest and truthful he should overflow in love to all and cultivate the friendship of the good when he has time and opportunity after the performance of these things he should employ them in polite studies
5352282 if a man withdraws his mind from the love of beauty and applies it as sincerely to the love of the virtuous if in serving his parents he can exert his utmost strength if in serving his prince he can devote his life if in his intercourse with his friends his words are sincere although men say that he has not learned i will certainly say that he has
5352283 if the scholar be not grave he will not call forth any veneration and his learning will not be solid
5352284 when you have faults do not fear to abandon them
5352285 let there be a careful attention to perform the funeral rites to parents and let them be followed when long gone with the ceremonies of sacrifice then the virtue of the people will resume its proper excellence
5352286 when our master comes to any country he does not fail to learn all about its government does he ask his information or is it given to him
5352287 our master is benign upright courteous temperate and complaisant and thus he gets his information the masters mode of asking information is it not different from that of other men
5352288 while a mans father is alive look at the bent of his will when his father is dead look at his conduct if for three years he does not alter from the way of his father he may be called filial
5352289 in practicing the rules of propriety a natural ease is to be prized in the ways prescribed by the ancient kings this is the excellent quality and in things small and great we follow them
5352290 yet it is not to be observed in all cases if one knowing how such ease should be prized manifests it without regulating it by the rules of propriety this likewise is not to be done
5352291 when agreements are made according to what is right what is spoken can be made good when respect is shown according to what is proper one keeps far from shame and disgrace when the parties upon whom a man leans are proper persons to be intimate with he can make them his guides and masters
5352292 he who aims to be a man of complete virtue in his food does not seek to gratify his appetite nor in his dwelling place does he seek the appliances of ease he is earnest in what he is doing and careful in his speech he frequents the company of men of principle that he may be rectified such a person may be said indeed to love to learn
5352293 what do you pronounce concerning the poor man who yet does not flatter and the rich man who is not proud
5352294 they will do but they are not equal to him who though poor is yet cheerful and to him who though rich loves the rules of propriety
5352295 it is said in the book of poetry as you cut and then file as you carve and then polish the meaning is the same i apprehend as that which you have just expressed
5352296 with one like tsze i can begin to talk about the odes i told him one point and he knew its proper sequence
5352297 mate this place is laced with space invaders bargain basement ronnie krays we ought to slay the traitors we ought to get us organised and fight the spiteful riflers the tooled up plumber knifers and the stifling life triflers
5352298 terry youre a jobless east end piss head muff diver and youre sour crowded full of powerless spit and saliva like me a magic realism imbibing contriver of riled rhymes and son of a minicab driver we aint bloody spidermen and no one else is neither

5352300 wuh are you talking to me get the gin and coke in its a quarter to three

5352351 taiwan does enjoy closer ties with china than with other nations not to mention the fact that we share the same language and similar culture
5352352 but we take a dispassionate view of competing here we do not ask that china treat us any differently to other people from around the world
5352353 chinas baseball has made considerable improvements over the years thats not in doubt whats more important is for us to review our system at home
5352354 some of our professional baseball players go to japan or the us to further their careers and when important events like the olympics come their teams do not necessarily release them like new york yankees pitcher wang chien ming
5352355 we need to create a better environment for players to bring their talents into full play so that fans can watch their favorite players compete for our country
5352356 we didnt have to do what we did today we were relaxed we had a bit of fun and it was all right

5352386 theyre thinking its an easier path to the gold medal its a little bit of disrespect theres motivation for us if serbia gets that far well be ready for them
5352387 it was extremely hard it was hot i think it was a great course for a triathlon it was a really tough course
5352388 i feel very proud and honored to be an australian with a gold medal around my neck at the olympic games
5352389 i believe we came so close in sydney and athens that this makes up for those very close defeats
5352390 lessons learned through life are there not necessarily for good or bad reasons you just have to take them as they are and move on
5352391 i think triathlon is a passion ive really put my heart and soul into it and every ounce of energy so im very lucky to be able to do that and to be here
5352392 im not sure i can wait another eight years to play in another olympics though it took me 12 years to get here
5352393 it was disappointing i think in the first half we played pretty well our attacking play was very good
5352394 but in the second half we never looked like breaking them down
5352395 i dont want to be sacked but maybe it is one line that chelsea will follow because at chelsea if you dont win it is bad
5352396 i have a contract for two years and i will try and stay two years but its true nobody remembers a loser

5352409 in a final if you play your best you can win for sure but i think today i played more with my mind than my body
5352410 i am pretty sad that maybe i could not be quite at 100 percent today but he played great winning another title
5352411 in the past weve taken some time on this decision but we know who is returning we have a lot of players back and we have some talented rookies coming into camp

5352485 i have now established a new company called smart personalized medicine llc to pursue the goal of developing a superior breast cancer prognostic test using hdcs svm technology as such i would like to now finalize negotiations and execute a license and development contract with hdc in the field of breast cancer in exchange for an hdc participatory equity position in this new company and a per test royalty to be paid to hdc after successful commercialization of the new breast cancer prognostic test if we are successful this has the opportunity to benefit the hdc shareholders i believe that it is necessary for me to resign from the board of directors of hdc at this time in order to have the opportunity to attempt to independently negotiate a license and development agreement with hdc for smart personalized medicine llc in the field of breast cancer applications the hdc licensing attorney has advised both hdc and me that to avoid any potential conflict of interest issues in my negotiations with hdc i should be negotiating from an independent position and not as a member of the hdc board of directors i respect that opinion and am honoring that request
5352486 as an hdc shareholder i remain very excited about the future of hdc and therefore i would like to continue participating in the exciting opportunities currently facing the company therefore i will continue as a senior advisor to the company effective immediately upon my board resignation
5352487 this is a tremendous opportunity for hdc to participate with dr caruso as he initiates development of a breast cancer prognostic test using hdcs svm technology to successfully compete with other breast cancer prognostic tests like oncotypedx provided by genomic health nasdaqgm ghdx this type of undertaking requires focused attention and potentially millions of dollars in funding to succeed a primary focus of hdc currently is the successful commercial launch of our recently announced prostate cancer test therefore the best opportunity to achieve success for our shareholders would be to have dr caruso start a new company that is independently funded and solely focused on the development of breast cancer prognostic tests
5352488 with dr carusos successful track record as current chairman of the board and founder of integra life sciences nasdaqgs iart and honored as the national ernst amp young entrepreneur of the year in 2006 hdc shareholders should greatly benefit from his experience and determination as he sets his sights on using hdcs svm technology to develop a new and improved breast cancer prognostic test to predict the right treatment for the right patient at the right time the essence of personalized medicine

5352504 prices of computer chips or dynamic random access memory dram hit the bottom in the second quarter which will help retard the decline in local dram makers overall revenues

5352514 from the beginning our relationship with epicor retail has been an extension of the jcpenney development team rather than a typical vendor supplier dynamic
5352515 epicor consistently demonstrates a high degree of integrity and quality in what they commit to and what they deliver to jcpenney and they value our input and experience as a leading retailer when looking at future product development initiatives

5352518 while you no longer need a multi million dollar budget to get a message out you do need access to the internet
5352519 but even though the largest of the political bloggers now have a combined monthly audience of over 10 million people they cant use traditional press venues at the convention the big tent is about access for the new media and technology vendors such as meru google and digg are key to helping us provide that access
5352520 because its a tent everything has to be imported and as many as 400 users may be online simultaneously at peak periods with a changing mix of data voice and video
5352521 so we were looking for a product that was quick to deploy and could support a lot of people in a small area the meru wireless lan addressed those demands
5352522 we chose 11n because the area around the convention will be extremely dense with journalists and electronic news gathering equipment all competing for bandwidth
5352523 because meru 11n dual radio access points can work in the both 5 0 or 2 4 gigahertz ghz radio spectrums users with newer 11n equipped laptops or handhelds can occupy the 5 0 ghz band while those with legacy 802 11b g clients use the 2 4 ghz band since meru 11n access points are backward compatible with the 11b g standards they can serve any type of wi fi client
5352524 will bring predictability to the inherently unpredictable almost chaotic environment that characterizes media coverage of a national political convention this environment has an absolute requirement for a robust infrastructure that simultaneously supports voice data and video and can adjust in real time to changing demands

5352642 we think intel will probably not exit the flash business as this business eats up n 1 and n 2 process technology capacity
5352643 what will intel do with all its 90nm and 65nm capacity if it exits all flash memory operations the firm will still have the depreciation associated with that equipment whether it makes flash memory or not
5352644 in fact the whole reason intel entered these businesses to begin with was so that flash memory could serve as a fab filler further management may think hope or wish that solid state drives will come and save the day with respect to flash pricing we think this is also an unlikely scenario given the enormous supply of memory capacity that samsung continues to ramp
5352645 when i was doing the research for this report i asked sites how hard their traffic had been hit by the introduction of in stream ads
5352646 the answer was very little usually they reported flat growth for a month or two or a few percent down before normal growth continued
5352647 half the people that leave because of the ad would have left because of the content anyway
5352648 he calculates that on sites that do it well only a 5 percent loss is directly attributable to advertising
5352649 it makes sense that in stream ads are more popular because everyone has broadband now and we expect to see richer content on the web
5352650 its also a return to allowing people to sit back again people can relax and be entertained which might be refreshing in this cluttered call to action environment
5352651 they give online publishers access to a revenue stream that many are still missing out on
5352652 they are frightened to accept ads because consumers always say they dont like them and youtube terrifies them by saying that ads lose them the vast majority of traffic

5352659 the israelis have one eye on the calendar because of the pace at which the iranians are proceeding both to develop their nuclear weapons capability and to do things like increase their defenses by buying russian antiaircraft systems
5352660 theres no telling what impact it could have on the election
5352661 could preclude military action happening for the next four years or at least delay it
5352662 it israel has been practicing operations for a long time
5352663 israel has long had the opinion that the iranians have a military program which they will fight to carry on why do you need to enrich uranium if you dont have the facilities that can make use of this uranium for civilian purposes the information that i have is serious enough to justify my concern about the iranian program
5352664 dropping a unanimous security council condition would simply be interpreted by iran and americas allies as unconditional surrender and americas friends would view this as confirmation of americas unreliability

5352868 the yankees will dip into their system to pluck a pitcher for saturdays game in baltimore a start that could go to either phil hughes or carl pavano making their way back from injuries both pitchers worked for the clubs top two minor league affiliates on sunday posting mixed results
5352869 that pretty much sums it up i was decent but i left too many fastballs over the plate and they jumped all over them physically i felt fine a little bit of a dead arm but youre going to go through those days when you dont have your best stuff you just try to compete and unfortunately i wasnt able to do that today the admission that his arm felt a little bit dead accounts for the lower velocity than weve seen his previous minor league outings

5352871 described the new rules as a narrow regulatory change that will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act

5352899 it could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5352900 however we think it is more probable that sq372 comes from the inner edge of the oort cloud
5352901 the existence of an inner oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years but sq372 and perhaps sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there its exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions
5352902 there are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys which will search to fainter levels and cover more area
5352903 in a decade we should know a lot more about this population than we do now
5352904 is to understand the origin of comets which are among the most spectacular celestial events but the deeper goal is to look back into the early history of our solar system and piece together what was happening when the planets formed

5352908 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments
5352909 operators need to take better control of their network assets so that they can offer a bespoke service to each user on a case by case basis
5352910 in a competitive european market where operators are increasingly trying to differentiate their service and the many millions of corporate subscribers are becoming increasingly international operators surely have no choice but to ensure they maximise all mobile broadband revenue opportunities whilst offering subscribers the best possible service

5352919 mobile operators in most of the world charge users to send updates when you send one message to twitter and we send it to ten followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill when we launched our free sms service to the world we set the clock ticking as the service grew in popularity so too would the price our challenge during this window of time was to establish relationships with mobile operators around the world such that our sms services could become sustainable from a cost perspective we achieved this goal in canada india and the united states
5352920 we took a risk hoping to bring more nations onboard and more mobile operators around to our way of thinking but weve arrived at a point where the responsible thing to do is slow our costs and take a different approach
5352921 even with a recently imposed limit of 250 messages received per week it could cost twitter about 1 000 per user per year to send sms outside of canada india or the us
5352922 its clear that the mobile industry is looking for more streamlined ways to on board and manage content and services
5352923 it can typically take months to introduce new mobile content and services across all the carriers this clearly needs to change as content and services lose relevancy with each passing month and some content is never considered because of the production time mobile service and content providers need to be able to react to the market quickly and provision new mobile content and services in a more dynamic fashion
5352924 75 are overseas when they text us a lot of questions are transport related but they can ask for anything in almost every case the answer is on line and we can respond in less than ten minutes
5352925 they send us the name of a hotel or whatever and we send back the gps coordinates which they key into the satnav
5352926 i found myself paying ridiculous rates for wifi access just to go on line for a minute to check something and using a mobile for internet access overseas was even more expensive a quick question by text to someone was always a better option
5352927 it may not be as quick but it is more accurate
5352928 we dont want to compete with google and develop clever algorithmns
5352929 they are fine when you have a very specific query like an address or the weather report for a city but for 99 of the questions that we get google sms will return sorry no results we couldnt work without google search but for our users out there with a mobile it is the person in the middle that makes it work

5352932 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites
5352933 those who believe that jerusalem should not be divided and mean by that that the arab neighborhoods should not be separated from the city should be the first to insist that an active policy be adopted by the government and the municipality to improve the lot of local arab residents barring that jerusalem will continue to remain a divided city
5352934 instead of adopting a resolute stance against terrorism the kadima labor government continues to release hundreds of prisoners in return for nothing
5352935 in an expedited process israel should now announce an organized plan to release prisoners as part of the diplomatic track with abbas the announcement alone and a real move toward implementing such a plan would immediately boost abbas popularity initiating a plan rather than responding to terrorists demands and strong internal public pressure would start a process in which each side israel the pa and the international community assumes responsibility if we dont plan the next step ahead of time we might find ourselves in the same situation again

5352949 even the arab minority in the city has shown its preference for living under israeli rule as many have moved to the israeli side of the security barrier being built around jerusalem their choice is reasonable as jerusalem offers the quality of life of a modern western city while only a few kilometers away the norm is a third world standard of living chaos and religious intolerance an undivided jerusalem is the best guarantee of a better life for all jerusalemites

5352951 what is the political logic by acting this way we not only encourage future kidnappings of soldiers but also reinforce the conception that israel only understands force in the long run it undermines our partner and the chances of reaching peace to make the picture more balanced we have to initiate prisoner releases in cooperation with the pa and demonstrate that this concept wrong

5352955 obama was caught red handed in his attempt to deceive the american people when nrlc released these official documents
5352956 i have said repeatedly that i would have been completely in fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion that was not the bill that was presented at the state level what that bill also was doing was trying to undermine roe v wade
5352957 so for people to suggest that i somehow in favor of withholding life saving support from an infant born alive is ridiculous it defies commonsense and it defies imagination and for people to keep on pushing this is offensive and its an example of the kind of politics we have to get beyond its one thing for people to disagree with me about the issue of choice its another thing for people to out and out misrepresent my positions repeatedly even after they know that theyre wrong
5352958 we now challenge obama to either declare the two 2003 documents to be forgeries and call for an official investigation or else apologize for his four years of misrepresentation on the issue of babies who are born alive during abortions and for calling us liars
5352959 obama is still blatantly trying to cover up his infanticide votes and the american people deserve to know the truth

5352967 jurisdictional procedural and substantial legal issues involved in bringing ahmadinejad to account and to justice
5352968 iran moves closer to acquiring nuclear weapons it is vital that every means including legal actions be used to deal with the threat of genocide
5352969 there is no such thing as absolute freedom of speech
5352970 convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide
5352971 a criminal indictment against ahmadinejad if he steps foot in canada
5352972 the enduring lesson of these tragedies is that they occurred not simply because of the machinery of death but because of the state sanctioned incitement to hatred this teaching of contempt this demonizing of the other this is where it all begins
5352973 the holocaust did not begin in the gas chambers it began with words
5352974 toxic convergence of the advocacy of the most horrific of crimes namely genocide embedded in the most virulent of hatreds namely anti semitism
5352975 argentinian government has asked for arrest warrants for those in iran who are responsible for the 1994 bombing of the jcc yet no governments have come forth to show support for such a venture

5352985 earlier on we had an issue as to whether wed get through winter but its now more of an issue of getting through spring
5352986 you are hanging by on the grace of the single circuit dc link i accept it is unlikely but things happen snowfall could knock a transmission tower down
5352987 were not there there are lots of steps that can be taken before we do that
5352988 the generators are concerned about the south island storage of course it is late in the year but what we can do about that of course is make sure we are getting as much dc flow on the cook strait cable because we are awash with water in the north island
5352989 it means our dependence on thermal power will carry on right through to the summer
5352990 it further highlights just how dependent we are on thermal generation when things get tight
5352991 but on the positive side of the ledger there is an awful lot of snow when temperatures warm that will be a very useful addition to the storage position
5352992 spring is when we start to get our main inflows through snow and rain its just a question of when it happens as things stand right now supply is tight in the south island a major complicating factor is constrained transmission from north to south
5352993 while both of these members are clearly grandstanding in a vain attempt to revive flagging popularity and impending obscurity this is a serious matter and should be treated as such
5352994 from the outset let me declare that i reject any claim of contempt of parliament the facts simply dont support the claims which have been levelled
5352995 the assertion that i knowingly breached standing orders by not disclosing the situation of multi millionaire owen glenn paying legal costs does not make sense the blunt fact is there is and was no debt

5353055 arka das 14 wanted his classmate sagar doluis i pod he asked sagars sister siuli 9 to come to him with the i pod at tilpara barrage a reservoir over mayurakshi river seven km from siuri on sunday evening so that he could click photographs of her when the girl reached the spot he snatched the i pod from her and pushed her off the barrage
5353056 i told siuli to hand me the i pod when she refused i snatched it from her and threw her down the barrage
5353057 but when i saw that siuli had fallen on the bank of the river instead of the water and was alive i was scared that she will tell the elders so first i tried to choke her to death and then smashed her head with a stone

5353149 the conservative nanny state how the wealthy use the government to stay rich and get richer
5353150 it is not surprising that a washington celebrity like john mccain would be able to collect contributions based on 26 years of special favors provided to individual businesses
5353151 it shouldnt be a surprise that john mccains plan to cut taxes fight wasteful spending and grow jobs is preferred by business leaders and hardworking families both
5353152 its also no surprise that barack obama doesnt have a record of doing any of those things celebrities dont cut taxes they take beach vacations
5353153 ich bin gut in montr al angekommen hier ist es sehr sch n und auch das wetter ist super
5353154 io sono cos arrivati a montreal qui molto bello e il tempo grande
5353155 i got it from the body of a georgian soldier
5353156 tskhinvali doesnt exist its like stalingrad was after the war
5353157 its not clear to us at all where those numbers are coming from
5353158 unfortunately they just lifted the call and ab 1806 failed passage on a vote of 18 21
5353159 reconsideration was granted but it does not look like we will be able to get the votes to get the bill off the senate floor
5353160 we tried to lobby the members to get the last few votes but unfortunately the fact that the bill went on call gave the opposition more time to lobby members to move into the no column
5353161 this bill was to be the beginning of the delta fishery restoration process and would have provided funds for the states impacted salmon fishery its defeat is a slap in the face to californias commercial and recreational anglers
5353162 we were counting on this bill as a funding mechanism for hundreds of projects needed to recover salmon
5353163 in spite of our successful efforts to move the bill through the assembly and two senate committees in the end we were outgunned by the intense lobbying of the water contractors and the administration the bill is dead for this year
5353164 do we give up absolutely not we come back next year better organized and with all the additional grassroots firepower we can muster we wont give up until we get the funding for mitigation and fish recovery if you are as mad as we are take the action that will help the most get everyone you know to sign onto water4fish org click and send letters to the politicians and give us the powerful proxy ammunition we can use
5353165 the death of tens of thousands of fish including striped bass and other sportfish could have been prevented with some basic planning

5353168 hes been very truthful and to me thats the only way you can find common ground
5353169 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them
5353170 russia does have interests and at some point theyre going to stand up and draw lines that are not simply to be ignored
5353171 we were training saakashvilis army and he was getting at least a corps of highly trained individuals which he could use for adventures
5353172 the feeling in the intelligence community was that this was a very high risk endeavor
5353173 but it was a little bit of the price we were willing to pay for the military cooperation in iraq
5353174 i go back to the democracy thing im not saying i gave them a big pass here but looking back i should have pressed harder
5353175 the claim that this process is not directed against russia will not suffice
5353176 it definitely wasnt what i would call a look into your eyes and see your soul meeting
5353177 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
5353178 theres no doubt that the georgians have carefully cultivated a broad base of support in washington
5353179 its possible that georgians may have confused the cheerleading from washington with something else

5353190 is this the summer that the internet finally kills television as we once knew it
5353191 most industry observers are stopping short of that prediction citing some significant hurdles still in the way but the growing number of new deals and new devices being announced suggests that a profound change in the way people watch video and what video they watch is under way the line between television and video via the internet already has blurred and may disappear in coming years at least one industry analyst has declared tv is dead and welcomes americans to a new age of video everywhere

5353236 there will be a precipitous slowdown in global growth and that means a lot less demand for things like energy and base metals
5353237 it would be insane to step in and buy oil or metals now these markets will be vulnerable for the next four of five months
5353238 whether that is a final peak or an intermediate peak followed by higher prices we dont know yet it could go lower
5353239 theres a perception that demand for commodities might be weakening
5353240 north america and western europe are struggling but the emerging economies remain strong

5353242 opec will remain firmly in control of the oil market for at least the next decade
5353243 longer term we would not be surprised to see gold double
5353244 we would be aggressive buyers at current levels expecting gold to work higher through 2009 10
5353245 george we see the worst inflation numbers in 17 years food is running on empty theres a threat of global war which could go global and all these other pressures so why isnt the price of gold going through the roof and making us rich

5353268 it has put money in the local economy and reduced attacks on coalition forces
5353269 you can see where the money is going an irrigation pump here a renovated home there
5353270 the government must listen to what the awakening councils have to say
5353271 they deserve that because of all the sacrifices they have made
5353272 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5353273 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military

5353275 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5353276 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5353277 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5353278 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia

5353296 they will develop a financial recovery plan for the school district and can assume whatever powers they deem necessary in order to supervise the finances of the district
5353297 the majority of the school district does not lie in a municipal corporation therefore the county auditor is responsible for designating one of the members of the commission
5353298 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5353299 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5353300 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5353301 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5353302 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5353303 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5353304 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5353305 that first inning it seemed like everything fell for them
5353306 one of the main reasons we havent been able to maintain a streak is because we just havent pitched good
5353307 nobody should ever score 10 runs in the first inning off you
5353308 we hope to get at least two games in this week
5353309 you set the standard so high and you lose one series and ask whats wrong
5353310 thats what were saying weve been riding the wave so long we have to get another wave
5353311 each time out he is making a statement establishing himself as a legitimate top of the order starter in either league
5353312 i havent been a part of or seen a team swinging the bats as well as we are right now
5353313 we have a very good team in all aspects of the game
5353314 we can play defense hit and pitch and our bullpen is very good
5353315 i think were doing a good job of bringing the same effort level every day
5353316 ive seen him get out of jams so much this season when the game is on the line you see the best joe nathan
5353317 win or lose they keep fighting to the end so ive been satisfied with their effort the execution is something we just have to improve on
5353318 im predicting that im going out on a limb you heard it here first
5353319 when hes out there we feel like we dont have to score a lot because hes not going to give up a lot when hes out there theres a good chance well win
5353320 a slip of the foot you may soon recover but a slip of the tongue you may never get over
5353321 from georgian sources and reporters based in georgian controlled territory the story of a relentlessly vicious russian attack against an isolated government emerged
5353322 only to be matched by a story emerging on the other side of the front line of a steady campaign against a barbaric genocidal regime
5353323 ele era o administrador de uma rede de pedofilia e respons vel por armazenar e distribuir imagens indecentes de crian as na internet
5353324 pick the land use planning system of whatever state you want and adopt that and itll be an improvement over what we have in oregon right now
5353325 oregon has been a beacon in many ways of what is possible
5353326 if this were to substantially undermine the outcomes and successes that oregon has had it wouldnt be a good thing and it would be disappointing
5353327 fundamentally the proposal that troubles us the most is the proposal that the lands that arent so called foundation lands the best of the best are open to development
5353328 he decided all those years ago he would go where he felt pinot noir would prosper best and he picked the northern willamette valley of all places he happened to pick here and in fact he picked this hill
5353329 you know if that recommendation had been in place 30 years ago this whole hillside would have been chopped up into five acre ranchettes because yamhill county considered this to be worthless ground
5353330 people on the other side would say they dont have the expertise to make those decisions i think thats maybe a little arrogant
5353331 i think some of these groups like 1000 friends need to understand what the state has gone through in the last four or five years with measure 37 and i think it was a clear message from the voters that they didnt like the direction it was going and they wanted some change
5353332 le 24 mai 1863 un dimanche mon oncle le professeur lidenbrock revint pr cipitamment vers sa petit maison situ e au n mero 19 de k nigstrasse lune de plus ancienne rues du vieux quartier de hambourg
5353333 part of the reason is because we have a declining 18 year old population the number of young people is just declining significantly the people who would have been the 18 year olds left the state 18 years ago and so we have this declining enrollment
5353334 when i went to john marshall we had 1 500 to 1 600 students in three grades
5353335 now there are 1 100 students in four grades what you have in our area is a reflection of the way the economy has changed and as a result without that economic base we have an older population
5353336 not only do we have this declining population but competition in higher education is increasing significantly
5353337 you still have a large number of private schools you have online schools
5353338 just doing those types of things you have to do to be competitive
5353339 and youve always got the balance of demands for resources
5353340 people are sitting around the pittsburgh or cleveland or columbus area or even in charleston or beckley and they decide for example they want to go into communications
5353341 part of the reason is the facility we offer and the quality of people weve brought in to teach our class
5353342 now why are we subsidizing retail and strip malls parking garages and were not subsidizing a couple of things that can actually create high paying jobs in health care
5353343 and 90 percent of new jobs created stay in that community
5353344 you go to morgantown theyre out of space theyre going up they cant go out any more theyre running into rivers and hills part of the reason is the commitment theyve made to research research creates new products new products create new industry
5353345 we dont need to fund research on the mating habits of left handed methodists in logan county
5353346 and there was something about the cows flatulating into the atmosphere and the amount of methane gas created

5353351 fortunately the cruciate ligament is ok and therefore the big danger of missing the entire season has been avoided a huge weight has been lifted
5353352 weakness attracts those who are waiting to do america harm
5353353 i appreciate our presidents wisdom regarding the need to remove saddam hussein from power
5353354 the most subtle psychological manipulations can profoundly affect our political preferences
5353355 we think we are making these deliberate decisions but thats just an illusion
5353356 he has the personality of a fighter pilot when somebody stings you you want to strike out
5353357 just like the american people his reaction was show me somebody to hit
5353358 the right is nothing if not filled with liars and hypocrites
5353359 is a frightened little girl in a pink ballet tutu who acts like obama just wandered in from the rain forest with a bone thru his nose and a communist pamphlet in his loincloth the neocons who own jon voight and make him dance on the chabad telethons are the worst most elitist people on earth glen beck and jon voight are their bitches both of them are used tampons who must be flushed down the toilet immediately jon voight your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about forty million dollars a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more just sayin

5353370 harrods has withdrawn some of its 2008 christmas teddy bear range from sale as the product did not meet its strict quality and safety standards only 800 bears had been sold to customers before they were recalled
5353371 harrods was advised that the risk associated with the level of formaldehyde is very low however prolonged contact with the footpads from these bears over an extended number of months could in some cases cause irritation to sensitive skin
5353372 the sale of this item may be subject to regulation by the u s food and drug administration and state and local regulatory agencies if so do not bid on this item unless you are an authorized purchaser if the item is subject to fda regulation i will verify your status as an authorized purchaser of this item before shipping of the item
5353373 t he insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5353374 that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5353375 senator mccain was in a motorcade led by the united states secret service and held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5353376 andrea mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated in last nights forum at saddleback church
5353377 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions of meet the press viewers
5353378 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5353379 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5353380 never is the generation gap bigger than when parents and kids debate about what car to buy
5353381 it doesnt have to be hard though parents can get what they want and kids can too
5353382 were also looking at a storm surge of 3 to 4 feet so we should have a rise
5353383 so expect a lot of water and expect everything to be wet for a very long time
5353384 a lot of boat people coming off of their house boats too and just people who come from everywhere
5353385 i think because wilma was such a water event and everybody lost their cars
5353386 we thought it was going to be just a tropical storm not much of a blow little bit of rain
5353387 im sure its not going to be that bad just some rain and little wind
5353388 were not too concerned there could be a lot worse places to get stranded
5353389 we are talking about pulling back to the territory of south ossetia there should be no troops on the territory of georgia
5353390 we used to have there one light infantry battalion less than 600 people certainly it will be more soldiers but not just soldiers the force must be credible to prevent any further escalation of conflict there
5353391 lets then start thinking negotiating how can we prevent the definitive estrangement of our two countries
5353392 they want to impeach me now why do they want to do it
5353393 they want to impeach me now why do they want to do it
5353394 im predicting that im going out on a limb you heard it here first
5353395 liu would not have withdrawn unless the pain was intolerable
5353396 we did all we could i think all the chinese people will understand this situation and will encourage him to come back to the track
5353397 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5353398 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5353399 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5353400 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5353401 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5353402 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5353403 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5353404 the great difference is that i intend to win it first

5353412 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5353413 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed

5353418 the 40 minute dvd covers sight words that kids will use most often like of that he the said and play
5353419 not surprisingly i was really hoping thered be a spot left for me in the latest pbn dvd campaign featuring im not usually a fan of kids dvds give me a pixar movie instead please so thats a testimonial to the appeal of
5353420 kyle said that he really liked the animation which is no faint compliment
5353421 i admit that after listening to it and watching snippets of it i was afraid shed get pretty bored theres really no story line at all just words and scenarios and quite frankly the words dont even exactly relate to the scenarios
5353422 when i asked my daughter how she liked it she couldnt say enough about it in a few words she loved it
5353423 yeah im no expert and im not sure how it works
5353424 while the ambassador was initially interested in the dvd i noticed his attention waning after the first couple of words and he wandered off to find crayons and do other things
5353425 as i watched him closely i think he simply might not be ready for it while the age range on the dvd is 15 months to six years and the ambassador is now two i dont think hes fully engaged enough in reading and letters to watch the entire video yet i briefly ran the dvd by a friends daughter who is three and she clapped and repeated every word on the screen

5353453 we all hoped that there would be something fairly spectacular happen on the first day but that wasnt realistic
5353454 weve had buses on the road to christchurch dunedin and invercargill

5353456 i set out to do that but to put it into practice and actually do it is another thing
5353457 i dont think anyone saw that time coming through its pretty special
5353458 the recent weakening in the outlook for the eurozone economy the destination for around half of the uks exports suggests that there is a risk that activity in the uk will be even weaker than the bank of england expects
5353459 the central projection is for output to be broadly flat over the next year
5353460 but further ahead as food and domestic energy prices stabilise the growth rate of real take home pay should recover
5353461 and that together with some easing in credit supply conditions and a pick up in exports following the fall in sterlings effective exchange rate should support a recovery in output
5353462 provide some further support to gdp growth in the near term

5353494 for most local service sector businesses it was a pretty forgettable july with a continuation of low consumer activity and the overhang of tougher economic conditions
5353495 though this wasnt hugely surprising it would be a mistake to be too blase about the results
5353496 to put the declines in context the last time we saw consecutive falls of such magnitude in the retailing sector was during the 1991 recession
5353497 it wouldnt surprise to see these spending indicators creep back into positive territory a failure to do so as seems the risk would simply underscore the extent of retail angst and reflect lower prices being heavily discounted by retailers in order to shift stock

5353523 if there is a real woman even the trace of one still there inside the grumbling it can be brought to life again if theres one wee spark under all of those ashes well blow on it til the whole pile is red and clear
5353524 the things which are impossible with men are possible with god
5353525 following jesus is simple but not easy love until it hurts and then love more
5353526 to love at all is to be vulnerable love anything and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly broken if you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give your heart to no one not even to an animal wrap it careful round with hobbies and little luxuries avoid all entanglements lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness but in that casket safe dark motionless airless it will change it will not be broken it will become unbreakable impenetrable irredeemable the only place outside of heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers of love is hell
5353527 my suggestion was that we come back to albany now on august 19th tomorrow and that i will close the deficit internally that we have
5353528 and the legislature will address a possible deficit that we can have after that by matching me with a 600 million cut were rolling the dice if we dont get to 600 million because well have to come right back and be in deficit
5353529 if rain is god crying i think god is drunk and his girlfriend just slept with zeus
5353530 and fuel costs feed into just about everything which means that raw materials prices and food prices should continue to stay high too
5353531 investing in efficiencies can relieve pricing and competitive pressures for businesses
5353532 we saw about 3 9 billion invested in the sector in 2007 in north america alone more than triple the investment in 2002 its the third largest venture sector now behind it and life science
5353533 were seeing an accelerating rate of business formation and greater deal flow and exit opportunities
5353534 if you take every cent of venture capital thats been invested in the history of the category it nearly equals one week of exxons revenue
5353535 we have to reduce greenhouse gases by 90 percent by 2050 to keep the temperature rise to just 2 degrees celsius
5353536 in europe theyve already started lights go off when you leave a room even if you dont turn them off
5353537 perhaps because were an island we like offshore turbines and things bobbing in the water
5353538 when youre in the sea you have to think about things like how quickly the equipment rusts how youre going to maintain it and how much thatll cost
5353539 the landscape is wide open and theres a tremendous land grab going on in lighting and lighting controls
5353540 we had this chocolate manufacturer and we were able to show them that two thirds of their cost base was energy related
5353541 property rights traditionally understood have worked well for us so far and we havent had to couple them with property responsibilities
5353542 the ability to dispose of waste used to seem limitless
5353543 but now we have to institutionalize the pricing of bads along with the pricing of goods maybe the way that we do that is with a cap and trade system maybe its with a carbon tax
5353544 no creer as que me lo iba jugar todo a un combate contigo
5353545 if there was no political vacuum we would not have seen this huge response the vacuum is there in society and politics people always look for change
5353546 thirty years ago when i entered the film world there were many stars if i had thought there are already so many actors i would not have been here
5353547 i have no rivals in politics my fight is with poverty and hunger
5353548 it is a memorable day in my life after spending 30 years in cine field i have decided to enter politics in response to the call from all sections of people from here onwards i am dedicating my life to serve people
5353549 i am donning a new role i cant act in this role in this new role i have to live for others and this gives a satisfaction to me
5353550 when people come to me and tell me how the blood from the blood bank saved the life of their son or father i get immense satisfaction i go back to the house and share this with my family
5353551 i dont know politics just as i dont know how many blood groups are there i dont know the composition of blood but i know it can save life and i also know i can serve people by entering into politics
5353552 i consider it as a blessing from god i am fortunate to get this opportunity a few have got this opportunity i take it as my responsibility my dharma
5353553 i am not into politics for the sake of posts or power but for the satisfaction and peace of mind god has given me popularity and money it cant tempt me
5353554 hence my first public meeting is being organised on august 26 her birth anniversary i will speak how her life inspired me and what i want to do
5353555 a home guard in khammam district and an it couple in hyderabad ended their lives due to personal problems but wrote in their suicide notes that chiranjeevi should enter into politics to bring a change they reminded me of my responsibility
5353556 abdul kalam told me that people like you should come into politics people are looking at you not just as an actor but beyond an actor you should come into politics it will be wrong on part of good people if they dont come into politics after this i felt that it would be a historic blunder if i dont enter into politics
5353557 politics will be my priority but i am not closing the door on acting if a serious and educative film comes my way and it can serve society i will definitely do it
5353558 sensitiveness is my biggest asset i can understand the suffering of people
5353559 the nato secretary general has had a series of phone conversations with nato foreign ministers and will continue calling other foreign ministers during the day
5353560 i think you can expect a strong message to russia
5353561 i really see a united front tomorrow i dont think we are divided
5353562 the allies will reiterate full support for the territorial integrity of georgia
5353563 the foreign ministers will also probably send a message of solidarity and will agree on a package of measures
5353564 including the international mechanism to monitor respect of the engagements taken by both sides
5353565 we are going to help rebuild georgia into a strong georgian state
5353566 the russians will have failed in their effort to undermine georgia and we will be looking at what we can do with the states around that region as well
5353567 enforceable technology mandates that are unreasonable unworkable and way off topic

5353578 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
5353579 hey looks is the least important thing in a relationship
5353580 i know theres a special technique that involves rubbing a piece of tissue between your breasts once or twice a day that should work
5353581 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
5353582 det r blott en skugga och en tanke du lskar
5353583 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
5353584 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
5353585 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5353586 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5353587 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5353588 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5353589 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5353590 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5353591 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia
5353592 at present our headquarters are inside the operational area and they dont need to be we need the space for cargo storage and handling
5353593 not only that but these days the operational area is under strict security control which the port offices dont need to be part of
5353594 youve got an increase in hard surfaces upstream and the run off from that is directed straight into the nearest waterway in this case the te henui so the extra water puts added pressure on the corner that needs to be repaired now
5353595 youre damned if you do and youre damned if you dont
5353596 there isnt much you can do when youre at the end of the line like we are here
5353597 its not really the right time to be repairing the bank but if you dont do it now there might be nothing left in few weeks
5353598 it was quite a serious assault police were concerned for his safety
5353599 there has been a noticeable change in tone around the school the children are really enthusiastic about the virtues
5353600 its something we have been looking at for the last couple of years we realised what we had wasnt working and we needed to find a solution
5353601 weve reached the end of the road but we have a responsibility to provide for these children
5353602 we have some wonderful staff and kids here they are making it happen
5353603 this is how we have chosen to work towards the changing needs of our children
5353604 there is no respect for perceived authority we are struggling as a whole society
5353605 people are losing sight of these values such as caring for one another self discipline courtesy honesty
5353606 a lot of evils been perpetuated based on the claim that we were fighting evil

5353609 all too often the direct economic value generated by pastoralists is not retained in their communities and the indirect value is unrewarded and even unacknowledged by decision makers
5353610 however their adaptability cannot be realised without government support and investment
5353611 what heinous event brought this law on in the first place
5353612 even with segue we are still only mapping a small fraction of the galaxy
5353613 so 14 streams in our data implies a huge number when we extrapolate to the rest of the milky way
5353614 in the center of the galaxy these stellar strands crowd together and you just see a smooth mix of stars
5353615 but as you look further away you can start to pick out individual strands as well as features more akin to pasta shells that come from dwarfs that were on more elongated orbits by looking at faint features kevin may be finding some of the angel hair that came from smaller dwarfs or ones that were destroyed longer ago
5353616 because the stream from one dwarf galaxy can wrap around the milky way and pass through streams of stars ripped from other dwarf galaxies
5353617 part of what we see toward virgo is a tidal arm of the sagittarius dwarf galaxy whose main body lies on the opposite side of the milky way but we dont know the origin of the other structures there really arent enough pasta varieties to describe all the structures we find
5353618 we expect that the number of dark matter clumps is much larger than that so something must prevent the smaller clumps from gathering gas and forming stars
5353619 i think the internal dynamics of these tiny galaxies may be hard to explain with our conventional ideas about dark matter
5353620 to increase the number of advance placement classes in our high schools
5353621 we know we have thousands of children with the potential and we want to make sure that there is an opportunity to take advance placement classes
5353622 we want to take advantage of governor stricklands new senior to sophomore program where seniors can spend their senior year on a college campus and complete a year of high school
5353623 after viewing the situation and consulting legal advisers and political allies with their advice i have decided to resign
5353624 ich habe mich in china als gast zu verhalten und keine politische propaganda zu machen

5353626 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5353627 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials
5353628 in the context of the longer term growth the demand challenges that the world will deliver and the supply challenges that i have described the combination of bhp billiton and rio makes more sense than ever
5353629 we have achieved another year of record earnings driven by excellent operating performance cost control and the delivery of high margin growth projects into strong market conditions
5353630 the effects of current weaknesses in the developed economies on demand for our commodities should be minimal driven by ongoing strong demand from the emerging economies

5353638 i think ea called take two and said you can either participate or not
5353639 i think take two is going to negotiate a dollar per share higher and then claim victory a deal is going to get done
5353640 that 25 74 was predicated on distributing their products at christmas this year
5353641 going forward we are challenged to validate that 25 74 price
5353642 a mutual deal is going to have to be higher than 25 74 in order for the board of take two to save face call it a dollar or two dollars more
5353643 the integration risk is that you lose the talent and ea cant afford to lose the talent
5353644 the beijing police are either so incompetent that they would let her disappear under their nose or that they must be responsible for taking her away how can a young woman with an infant child sabotage the olympics while under such heavy and round the clock police presence
5353645 the fda alone simply lacks the ability to serve as the sole guarantor of drug safety
5353646 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
5353647 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
5353648 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
5353649 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
5353650 the compact is the only protection colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states
5353651 opening it for renegotiation would be the equivalent of a lamb discussing with a pack of wolves what should be on the dinner menu

5353657 the continuation of the awakening councils as they are now is unacceptable
5353658 we fought the americans for four years and we fought al qaida too
5353659 we are an experienced armed group we are fully capable of bringing the house down
5353660 it has put money in the local economy and reduced attacks on coalition forces
5353661 you can see where the money is going an irrigation pump here a renovated home there
5353662 the government must listen to what the awakening councils have to say
5353663 they deserve that because of all the sacrifices they have made
5353664 montenegro is the new magnet for people seeking picturesque villas on the mediterranean
5353665 the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed
5353666 least of all is that empire missed by the once captive nations of estonia latvia lithuania poland ukraine and georgia
5353667 these brave young nations have joined the free world and they are not going back
5353668 should be able to count on the free world for support and solidarity
5353669 if i am elected president they will have that support
5353670 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5353671 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5353672 in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5353673 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

5353700 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people
5353701 let us say to the immigrant not that we hope he will learn english but that he has got to
5353702 by the use of the hyphen and along the lines of national origin is certain to a breed of spirit of bitterness and prejudice and dislike between great bodies of our citizens if some citizens band together as german americans or irish americans then after a while others are certain to band together as english americans or scandinavian americans and every such banding together every attempt to make for political purposes a german american alliance or a scandinavian american alliance means down at the bottom an effort against the interest of straight out american citizenship an effort to bring into our nation the bitter old world rivalries and jealousies and hatreds
5353703 my goal as a filmmaker is to create films that show the horrifying ability of the human will to me i think thats the scariest thing in the world because what a person can do when they set their minds to it is far more shocking than a ghost or monster

5353721 dia juga cerita akan mengembalikan uang itu karena merasa tidak tenteram dan bersalah dia juga katanya sudah mengajak rekan rekannya untuk mengembalikan meskipun kpk belum menangani kasus ini ia tetap berniat mengembalikan uang itu sebab ia merasa tidak benar

5353818 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro

5353893 we are going to nationalize banco de venezuela i make an appeal to grupo santander to come here so that we can start to negotiate
5353894 months ago i received the information through intelligence sources that banco de venezuela which had been privatized for years was being sold by its spanish owners that an agreement had been signed between grupo santander and a venezuelan private banker then the venezuelan banker needed the permission of the government to buy a bank this is not a small operation and then i sent a message to the spanish and the venezuelan banker to tell them that the government wanted to buy the bank we want to recover it then the owners said no we dont want to sell it so now i say no i will buy it how much is it we are going to pay for it and we are going to nationalize banco de venezuela
5353895 from this moment the media campaign on the part of the spanish and international media is going to start they are going to say that ch vez is an autocrat that ch vez is a tyrant i dont care we are going to nationalize the bank regardless
5353896 there is something obscure here because its owners first were desperate to sell and now they are saying they do not want to sell it to the venezuelan state we are going to nationalize it so that it is put at the service of the venezuelan people
5353897 we need a bank of that size because this is the banco de venezuela but this bank generates massive profits but these profits are going abroad
5353898 profits will not go to one private group they will be invested in socialist social development socialism is stronger every day that passes

5354060 irrespective of aircraft type i would like to offer the condolences of all the bmaa membership to the families and friends of the pilots and passengers of the two aircraft
5354061 i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years
5354062 as he turned away he turned back and said i thought about it
5354063 this is one of those times where everything seemed to be clicking
5354064 wed like to have scored on the first drive all in all it was good i was ok with it
5354065 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
5354066 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around ok
5354067 very much in control of the huddle like he always is and very much in control of the game and that allowed us to be in control as an offense as a unit we felt like everything that we were going to run was going to work
5354068 he moved the team down the field and put us in a position to score
5354069 does that sound a little awkward or funny maybe a little bit believe me i feel very comfortable here the guys have been great theyve welcomed me i feel like im here for a reason as ive told the guys im here for one reason to help you win ill do whatever that takes and i hope it works out

5354072 were a team and im just one piece of this puzzle
5354073 at some point we have to go on and focus on what were trying to do as a team and not on one person

5354084 john mccain has shown little concern for the struggles americas hard working families face in an economy crippled by the policies of the bush administration the reality is that john mccain who helped create those policies has ten houses and flies around the world in a private jet he simply doesnt understand the challenges americas working families are facing because he isnt remotely affected by them
5354085 most working families today do not have homes that have anywhere near ten rooms john mccain has ten houses many working people in america have to work two and three jobs to provide for their families and pay their car loans john mccain hops on a private jet is it any wonder why mccain champions a george bush agenda of cutting taxes for corporations and the wealthy helping oil companies turn record profits and leaving working families to fend for themselves mccains velvet world leaves him utterly unprepared to make the tough choices we need to restore the middle class and ensure that everyone in america has quality affordable health insurance
5354086 im gonna run to you run to you run to you

5354567 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5354568 if youre here for the quick fix then this surgery is not for you
5354569 because its risky its only appropriate for a tiny fraction of people with obesity the sickest 1 to 2 percent
5354570 the idea that all obese people should get surgery is insane
5354571 they herded us like cattle into this large conference room there were at least 100 people all terribly desperate to lose weight
5354572 they paraded the successful patients giving them the microphone i never thought i could wear a size medium in my life and now im so happy and things are wonderful and everyones clapping people were getting all whipped up and the doctors were selling the surgery
5354573 is gastric bypass surgery right for you click here to see if we can help you qualify
5354574 it works much like the cosmetic surgery industry its heavily advertised to patients especially to women and theres lip service being paid to health but for patients the great motivator is to improve appearance
5354575 that should be the headline surgery cures type 2 diabetes
5354576 this is about disease and disease going away to think were out there as pseudo plastic surgeons thats totally bass ackwards
5354577 but were not watchdogs we only know what is reported to us
5354578 its daunting to some doctors how much you have to spend on the follow up program not everyones doing what they should
5354579 permanent weight loss no such thing no risk there aint no such animal as no risk
5354580 if you see a doctors website that says these things run like hell
5354581 one of the first tenets youre taught as a surgical trainee is to fear fat
5354582 its those additional surgeries you worry about because theres a significantly increased risk in repeat operations
5354583 it was excruciating right in the center of my breastbone and straight through to my back
5354584 what you have then is a blind loop the intestine is obstructed in one direction and partitioned in the other direction so theres no exit
5354585 if they dont get surgery within 12 hours the bowel could dilate and explode
5354586 it was traumatic one of the most horrible experiences of my life
5354587 all i could think about was ending up back on that ventilator
5354588 no matter how small a bite i took no matter how much i chewed i would feel it just sitting there a pain in my chest like a heart attack then it would come right up
5354589 i think i would have taken it out myself if i had known how
5354590 for the first four or six months we actually have to remind patients to eat
5354591 thats when they have to start listening to their body because it becomes harder to change their eating behaviors
5354592 post op these people grieve for the loss of food
5354593 food is their comfort and if you dont figure out how to find comfort in other ways youre going to go with what you know these are some serious eaters
5354594 the surgery changes our physiology the way the body responds to food it makes heavy people more like people who are naturally thin
5354595 understanding this as a set point issue allows us to stop blaming the patient who doesnt do as well because they were just built that way what they lose is what they lose and they cant expect to lose any more
5354596 surgery is the best thing we have right now but it isnt the optimal cure
5354597 we need to figure out why it works so we can eliminate it if we do this right we wont be doing surgery for obesity in 50 years

5354615 for all its eviscerations of the administration the daily show is animated not by partisanship but by a deep mistrust of all ideology
5354616 a sane voice in a noisy red blue echo chamber mr stewart displays an impatience with the platitudes of both the right and the left and a disdain for commentators who as he made clear in a famous 2004 appearance on cnns

5354618 i think he obama is going to win the election because of colorado
5354619 i think it is going to be a swing state and it is going to be important at the end of the day
5354620 nevada has emerged as a key battleground state and although the bulk of the states population is firmly in southern nevada the north some think will be a key to victory republicans have relied on strong margins in places such as elko and hawthorne and to a lesser extent washoe county to make up for the democratic leanings of las vegas for democrats it has been a place where candidates have spent time and money only to see strong republican numbers on election day
5354621 though outside spending is nothing new in north carolina the amount of money involved is higher than in past years the early appearance of negative ads has already put some candidates on the defensive on such issues as campaign contributions tax breaks for oil companies and the minimum wage
5354622 experts say the deluge of out of state money is due to several factors closer than usual races in north carolina strong democratic fundraising nationally and the confluence of big ticket races for president governor and senator on the same ballot

5354625 this card is not intended to either replace the va or privatize veterans health care as some have wrongly charged i believe the va should always be there to provide top quality care for our veterans and i believe the va should continue to provide broad spectrum health care to eligible veterans in addition to specialized care
5354626 i suppose from my opponents vantage point veterans concerns are just one more issue to be spun or worked to advantage
5354627 this would explain why he has also taken liberties with my position on the gi bill
5354628 our veterans administration is not equipped to care for the wounded as a result of this long war
5354629 im going to give every veteran a plastic card that needs a routine healthcare need and say take this plastic card to a health care provider or a doctor of your choice
5354630 illness or injury incurred during their military service and by those with low incomes
5354631 relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
5354632 theres gonna be large numbers of people who are afflicted unfortunately with ptsd and i believe we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine healthcare
5354633 put more of our assets in treating the unique capabilities of the va for the treatment of combat wounds as you described them both seen and unseen that means a veteran with a routine healthcare need rather than go down to the va and stand in line to stand in line to get an appointment to get an appointment should be given a plastic card and say if you have a routine healthcare need take it wherever you want to whatever doctor or healthcare provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care and our love on these grievous wounds of war both seen and unseen
5354634 i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5354635 when young democracies are threatened or attacked and innocent civilians are targeted they should be able to count on the free world for support and solidarity if i am elected president they will have that support and in cooperation with our friends and allies in europe we will make it clear to russias rulers that acts of violence and intimidation come at a heavy cost there will be no place among g 8 nations or in the wto for a modern russia that acts at times like the old soviet union
5354636 for some time now i have been making the case for a dramatic acceleration of domestic energy production
5354637 so i think those who come here will have an extraordinary time but the
5354638 how can you forgive obama for his drug use and breaking the law but you cant forgive mccain for something that happened almost 40 years ago at a time when hed been under duress for 5 1 2 years
5354639 i am usually in agreement with you but not this time its a big deal because the right wing keeps trying to portray obama as an unpatriotic empty suit if mcshame did hear the questions which i believe he did it shows him to be sneaky dishonest and unprincipled not the qualities id like in a president
5354640 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
5354641 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
5354642 and it would be nine if it werent in minneapolis
5354643 if the convention wasnt in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
5354644 the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples money
5354645 democrats face a number of imperatives at their convention none trickier than making more voters comfortable with the prospect of putting a candidate with a most unusual background the son of a black kenyan father and a white kansan mother who grew up in hawaii and indonesia and his family in the white house no one his advisers believe makes the case better for senator barack obama of illinois than his wife who will expand her profile by delivering one of the marquee speeches carried by television networks
5354646 the introduction of a candidate is a task facing every presidential campaign but one that carries unique challenges for mr obama because of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit
5354647 as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible

5354650 members of the mccain campaign staff who flew here sunday from california said mr mccain was in his motorcade on the way to the church as mr obama was being interviewed by the rev rick warren nicolle wallace a spokeswoman for mr mccain said on sunday night that mr mccain had not heard the broadcast of the event while in his motorcade and heard none of the questions
5354651 interviewed sunday on cnn mr warren seemed surprised to learn that mr mccain was not in the building during the obama interview
5354652 in what served as a preview for the fall debates mr warren questioned each man separately at his saddleback valley community church which is one of the largest in the nation with 22 000 members mr warren asked each candidate the same questions sen mccain who appeared second promised not to monitor sen obamas appearance and an aide said he didnt
5354653 sen mccains press secretary brooke buchanan said he prepared for the event much like he would prepare for a debate with briefing books and practice questions it was a good warm up for the fall she said a spokeswoman for sen obama said the candidate reviewed with advisers topics that might be raised but didnt do a full debate preparation
5354654 by watching obama and mccain go back to back tonight i think it offered a stark contrast on how they both approach the hot button social issues but obama has very little chance with die hard pro lifers anyway instead obamas goal is to come across as a caring family man who takes his faith and set of values very seriously that plays to the broader audience a forum like this only helps him in that regard
5354655 my gut reaction when it was over was that obama will pick up probably some younger votes and mccain will probably pick up some older votes and it might come down to which group winds up showing up that the polls
5354656 interviewed sunday on cnn mr warren seemed surprised to learn that mr mccain was not in the building during the obama interview
5354657 cone of silence explains how mcshame was able to answer a few of the questions before rick warren had even asked them i have never seen him that prepared in any of his previous appearances especially without lieberman graham or gramm there to coach correct him
5354658 if i vote for this guy i dont need an energy policy i need an insurance policy
5354659 squawk i was a pow squawk im a maverick squawk
5354660 when are you going to ask me about the supreme court judges
5354661 at conception but id like to get back to the questions about the supreme court judges
5354662 i particularly hope he strengthens his economic message even senator obama can speak more clearly and specifically about the kitchen table bread and butter issues like high energy costs said gov
5354663 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5354664 you know hes got a longer track record than that
5354665 one of the things i think we have to unify the country around is having an intelligent energy policy thats what were going to be talking about
5354666 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5354667 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5354668 theyve got theyve got talk radio hosts and theyve got television hosts and youve got john mccain all he wants to do is spend time talking about me because they know they cant win on the issues so what theyll do is theyll try to scare people
5354669 theyve got theyve got talk radio hosts and theyve got television hosts
5354670 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
5354671 hell in a worst case could we really be worse off trying someone who is willing to tackle the big problems
5354672 barack obama has got to be one of the most whiny polititians ever the man does nothing but complain
5354673 at every turn mccain is stating his case in clear and concise terms and doing and excellent job contrasting his postions with obama obama is busy defending his positions and not doing a very good job of doing so
5354674 so much for hugging in church a fter praising the arizona senator as a genuine american patriot the democratic presidential hopeful got back to business methodically tearing into mccains health care tax and energy policies and criticizing his advisers
5354675 the illinois senator also criticized mccains advisers as the same old folks that brought you george w bush the same team he noted many had been lobbyists in washington before mccain asked them to sever all lobbying ties
5354676 new voters alone wont win virginia for obama democrats say but they are a central reason obama has decided to put so many resources into a state that last went for a democratic presidential nominee in 1964 pennsylvania historically a battleground state has just 45 000 more registered voters than it did in 2004
5354677 if this were an election in a neutral environment gordon smith would probably win fairly easily but its just very toxic for republicans
5354678 it will have more to do with the shadow of president bush than the coattails of barack obama
5354679 for a meeting with steve capus the president of nbc news to protest what the campaign called signs that the network is abandoning non partisan coverage of the presidential race
5354680 the trigger was a comment by nbcs andrea mitchell who said on the air sunday that some aides to democrat barack obama thought mccain might have been listening saturday as obama was being questioned during pastor rick warrens
5354681 cone of silence the mccain campaign says the candidate did not hear any of the obama warren exchanges angellight sent monday august 18 2008 9 47 am
5354682 one other thing the fact that mccain wasnt in a
5354683 yes yes and find bad teachers another line of work
5354684 gone through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not so its not surprising then that they get bitter and they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who arent like them or anti immigrant sentiment or anti trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations
5354685 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5354686 the insinuation that hillary clinton a woman cheated is outrageous
5354687 the insinuation that barack obama a black man cheated is outrageous

5354808 i wonder what it would be like to not be unbearably adorable
5354809 i succeeded and a lot of the credit goes to this really easy hack of a galant desk there are several pieces in the galant family i chose the silver a frame adjustable legs and the galant rectangular desktop with frame the desktop is glass slick on the top surface and frosted translucent on the bottom surface the frame is a rectangle underneath the glass as soon as i saw this desk i knew i had to find a way to light it from below a quick trip through the lighting department led me to the dinge lights they are available in a translucent white grey that goes perfectly with the silver painted frame of the desk when paired with the correct sparsam fluorescent bulbs two of these will consume less than 15w of power while providing a bright crisp white light if you screw open the clamp on the dinge all the way it just exactly fits on the frame of the galant desktop pointing upwards to shine on the underside of the glass top use some white zip ties to secure the cords to the frame and youre done these photos dont do it justice the lighting is really pretty even rather than being the distinct hot spots shown in the photos blame the camera i really miss this desk amp lighting so i may re create it someday

5354870 we tried some different front tyres that michelin brought here for this test but we finished after some laps because we couldnt find any improvement we tested the tyres with my current race bike there was no point using the machine with the pneumatic valve engine because the tyres werent working well enough we have rescheduled this test at misano on the monday after the san marino gp
5354871 today we tested some new steps in development concerning both engine and electronics in japan we are working on the development of both the spring valve engine and the pneumatic valve engine since my last appearance at the italian motogp i can say that the bike with pneumatic valve engine has improved a lot i think that the bike has reached a satisfactory level of development i hope that dani will be able to test it soon
5354872 it was a good day of testing today after a great day of racing yesterday we have tested many different bridgestone tyres both front and rear and we have collected a lot of information which will help us for the rest of the season then we worked on some new electronics and mapping but we need to continue with this tomorrow because we havent finished the whole programme tomorrow we also have some general set up work to do to try some things that we werent able to check at the weekend due to losing one day to rain we hope that we will have another good day tomorrow finish all of our planned work and then we will leave here in good shape for the final push
5354873 the programme of the day test in the light of developments which occurred at the weekend was focused on the front rubber we have tried to collect the greatest amount of information possible to share with michelin the comparison with our technical partner should help us prepare for the next grand prix the weather conditions have helped us today and with a total of 40 laps with short and medium stints we managed to play out the full testing programme
5354874 today was a day mainly focused on research for a better performance from our rubber we have noted some progress but this is still not enough we expect michelin to work intensively to achieve the results we expect for the next race colin edwards has got a good lap time but only for three laps which is not significant enough for us to draw any conclusions we stayed out even longer to assess the durability of the tyres in addition to grip we were able also to do tests on electronics the next grand prix at misano i hope to take a good result in front of my home crowd

5354946 hay un impasse sobre la dimensi n cl nica y demuestran un sesgo acad mico fuerte que no permite la auto experimentaci n por ello decid ponerme a la escuela de los especialistas ind genas y dejarme guiar como si me llevar n en una selva desconocida donde aunque sin t tulos son los maestros en conocimiento a trav s de las visiones que tuve con la ayahuasca se revel el camino que me condujo al proyecto del centro takiwasi
5354947 el resultado de un intento por acceder al mundo invisible para hallar respuestas a angustias existenciales o sea frente a las propuestas limitadas y frustrantes de las instancias familiares pedag gicas religiosas y pol ticas el sujeto busca explorar otras dimensiones de la realidad m s all de la conciencia ordinaria atrevi ndose a un gesto trasgresor como intento de autoiniciaci n est b squeda es leg tima y necesaria para que la vida humana alcance su realizaci n en una dimensi n espiritual sin embargo mal conducida sin gu a control o preparaci n en un contexto inadecuado la exploraci n err tica de la conciencia conduce a contactar instancias ps quicas muy poderosas que terminan por avasallar la conciencia ordinaria fascinarla y alienar al sujeto
5354948 el deseo necesidad de acceder a estados modificados de conciencia es algo normal universal e inherente al ser humano aunque la adicci n es un camino equivocado esta es un proceso que involucra diversos niveles del ser sean el cuerpo la mente o las emociones pero adem s est profundamente arraigado lo espiritual
5354949 un tratamiento debe tratar estas sensibilidades y sutilezas de lo humano debe proveer de un contexto para que estas preguntas puedan ser conducidas y realizadas con toda propiedad si se responden con soluciones parciales y paliativas no se permite operar el potencial transformador y removedor que tienen por ello es vital que un contexto de tratamiento contemple y articule la dimensi n espiritual del hombre ste es el adecuado para realizar esas preguntas es all donde la b squeda es reconocida abiertamente contactada y acogida en su totalidad
5354950 los tratamientos convencionales suelen rondar el 20 de xito en takiwasi la tasa de xito de los pacientes que terminan el tratamiento bordea el 60 70 lo cual es significativo considerando adem s que muchos de los pacientes ya han pasado por varios tratamientos convencionales y la mayor a lleva en promedio entre 10 y 15 a os de dependencia a drogas duras
5354951 la curaci n es retomar este intento de iniciaci n para corregir los errores enderezar el camino y accediendo a una verdadera iniciaci n permitir al paciente finalmente encontrar en s mismo las respuestas a sus interrogantes existenciales
5354952 apunta a la resoluci n del conflicto de la persona en sus niveles conductual que implica la vida en comunidad y el trabajo lo psicol gico con la terapia individual y grupal y lo espiritual por medio del uso responsable de las plantas maestras de acuerdo a los c nones de la tradici n medicinal amaz nica administradas por los propios curanderos
5354953 ellos inscriben su medicina en un paradigma muy diferente del modelo conceptual occidental el reto en nuestra poca es establecer puentes o pasarelas entre esos diversos modelos de aprehensi n de la realidad para lograr construir un nuevo paradigma m s hol stico la medicina occidental se revela muy eficaz en acciones reparadoras y en situaciones de emergencia pero es ineficiente y hasta da ina en las patolog as cr nicas en la protecci n y est mulo del sistema de defensas en el mantenimiento del equilibrio mental donde las medicinas tradicionales tienen gran pericia

5355217 withdrawal without delay of all the russian military forces that entered georgia since august 7
5355218 russia will begin the withdrawal of the military contingent which was moved to reinforce russian peacekeepers after the georgian aggression against south ossetia
5355219 georgia will never give up a square kilometer of its territory

5355260 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5355261 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5355262 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5355263 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5355264 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5355265 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5355266 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5355267 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5355268 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5355269 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5355270 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5355271 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5355272 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5355273 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5355274 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5355275 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
5355276 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5355277 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5355278 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5355279 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
5355280 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
5355281 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
5355282 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
5355283 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
5355284 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
5355285 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
5355286 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5355287 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5355288 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5355289 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5355290 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5355291 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5355292 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
5355293 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5355294 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5355295 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me

5355343 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5355344 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5355345 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5355346 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5355347 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5355348 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5355349 represent s a turn of the clock back to an era of monopoly
5355350 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5355351 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5355352 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5355353 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
5355354 im puzzled i stay up late at night thinking about how we can get our offense going

5355360 i am not really sure why but species are generally regarded as being somehow more important than subspecies and hence merit higher conservation priority i confess i can t swallow this view without a good deal of choking and spluttering particularly if one considers that a polytypic species being an abstracted sum of its parts doesn t actually exist in fact the adoption of this view can be and often is positively unhelpful in that subspecies are all too often ignored and species conservation priorities are thus loaded in favour of the least threatened subspecies or populations a patently ridiculous and arguably irresponsible situation

5355366 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5355367 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer

5355374 telephony is critical to the success of our company and gohello has enabled an easy to use mobile service which our employees love and requires no technical expertise or understanding i would highly recommend gohellos allmobile telephony to anyone wanting to move away from the restrictions and complications of a fixed line phone system
5355375 with our previous telephony solution we often felt that important phone calls were missed due to our small workforce and travelling demands the gohello solution has overcome this as calls are now routed directly to employees mobiles our customers may not have noticed our new telephone system but that can only be a good thing by using gohello we dont need to worry about taking messages keeping the office manned or costly business calls leaving us to do what we do best running the business

5355380 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them

5355383 there was that one time back in april that she escaped to las vegas while your back was turned
5355384 remember that 5 000 00 repair bill i had waiting for her when she returned that was fun anyway i see that shes been checking various resort prices and availability but hasnt made reservations that must mean shes waiting to discuss options with alan i still have time
5355385 that sassy redhead seeks to outsmart me so far today she has refrained from using any electronics doing any laundry or household chores touching any of the computers or leaving the house i see what shes trying to do she thinks that if she doesnt use anything nothing will have an opportunity to break and she can go on her silly little vacation all shes doing is reading a paperback book theres not much i can do to a 7 paperback and if i destroy her reading lamp she wont care she only paid 125 for the pair on clearance and they have no sentimental value hey i know wheres her husband
5355386 alan is fifty miles away at kennesaw state taking his class in advanced technical writing he doesnt have his macbook there though just a pad and pen still its a blue ink pen we could ruin his shirt lets ruin his shirt
5355387 he probably wont even care he has seven more shirts exactly like that one same colour and everything lets wait until he gets home and helly has talked to him about their options for a mini break and theyre all excited about getting some r amp r then well strike
5355388 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5355389 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5355390 the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed
5355391 least of all is that empire missed by the once captive nations of estonia latvia lithuania poland ukraine and georgia
5355392 these brave young nations have joined the free world and they are not going back
5355393 should be able to count on the free world for support and solidarity
5355394 if i am elected president they will have that support
5355395 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5355396 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5355397 its a nice analogy because you can visualize what happens when the soup is poorly stirred
5355398 a residential street was then randomly selected from a list of residential streets crossing the main street
5355399 the claim of 15 000 deaths from u s vehicles
5355400 laftas team reported 24 car bomb deaths in early july as well as one nonviolent death in
5355401 a child health official in saddam husseins ministry of health
5355402 the survey teams failed to collect the fraud preventing demographic data that pollsters routinely gather
5355403 the authors refuse to provide anyone with the underlying data
5355404 1 the data will be provided to organizations or groups without publicly stated views that would cause doubt about their objectivity in analyzing the data
5355405 if the household agreed to be interviewed the interviewees were asked for the age and sex of every current household member respondents were also asked to describe the composition of their household on jan 1 2002 and asked about any births deaths or visitors who stayed in the household for more than 2 months periods of visitation and individual periods of residence since a birth or before a death were recorded to the nearest month
5355406 why do you find the lancet study believable when not a single other study confirms its findings
5355407 is there an upper bound by the numbers of deaths would have to be limited to to be believable
5355408 this is an obvious fabrication munro even provides a copy of the survey instrument which tells the surveyor to record demographic data
5355409 only record m f and the age if less than 4 years record age in months
5355410 that the 2006 study by burnham et al considerably overestimated the number of violent deaths
5355411 the new estimate of 151 000 violent deaths from march 2003 to june 2006 is three times higher than the number of casualties recorded for the same period by iraq body count a nongovernmental organization in london which reports only the violent deaths of civilians and only documented deaths
5355412 i have worked on national surveys in a developed country and i am pretty confident that there is no way david kane or anyone else can get access to that raw data without being connected to the study yet dk still makes this claim about much more sensitive data its extremely dishonest and nasty too for coming as it does with the implied fraud allegations
5355413 sg no other group or organization has a death tally for iraq approaching anywhere near the total the lancet study does
5355414 this is technically correct seeing as the orb survey came up with an even higher estimate
5355415 the new study which uses considerably better methods than did roberts et al such as best practice methods of selection a random sample
5355416 how many of the studies critical of the iraq war came out right before the american elections how many could influence the outcome of the american elections
5355417 only record m f and the age if less than 4 years record age in months
5355418 probably not the lancet study could have said 500 000 000 have died in the war in iraq and there would be posters here defending the study
5355419 interviewees were asked for the age and sex or every current household member
5355420 contact the first author of the paper gilbert burnham in order to acquire this information
5355421 my guess is that roberts mispoke above or is being purposely misleading
5355422 tone is unacceptable the facts are shoddy and the ideas are not endorsed by myself the other authors on the sidebar or the harvard iqss
5355423 certainly nothing wrong in a democracy with wanting the public informed
5355424 every cook knows that it only takes a single sip from a well stirred soup to determine the taste
5355425 the sample size is not really good enough to represent extremely variable conditions
5355426 no sample size is big enough but around 10 000 is starting to come into the range where we can do something with the data
5355427 as noted earlier this is an outright fabrication by munro
5355428 the serious problems are however with munros article with fabricated claims misrepresentation of sources a misleading graph and reliance on discredited arguments
5355429 as garfield explained in his email 250 000 is the number he would have guessed without the l2 study which is why munro is guilty of misrepresentation
5355430 this is ridiculous the survey was designed for 50 clusters even if the survey was scheduled to end by june 30 it makes no sense to stop then if some provinces were unsampled
5355431 no sample size is big enough but around 10 000 is starting to come into the range where we can do something with the data
5355432 the small sample size is accounted for in the large confidence interval
5355433 the journal made a convincing argument that the data may well have been tweaked
5355434 there is no reasonable way to not conclude that 600 000 violent deaths is by far the most accurate information now available
5355435 i feel confident that at least 250 000 have died due to violence since the 2003 invasion
5355436 i just finished my tax return and although its hard to believe our firm booked 600 000 in income this year
5355437 its just a guess but im confident our firm made over 250 000
5355438 vidjeli smo da je bmw imao lo a toyota dobar vikend ali ne vjerujem u iznenadne promjene konkurentnosti ekipa

5355543 at the time she was terrified her career would be over if she revealed her sexual tendencies
5355544 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5355545 bedded a string of men in a bid to suppress her lesbian urges and to hide them from her public
5355546 from the start lindsay was very confused about her feelings for courtenay so she did more and more drugs to stifle the sexual attraction she was experiencing
5355547 but eventually she just gave in and at every party theyd kiss and touch each other in the corner its a miracle nobody found out
5355548 both of them would do lines of cocaine in the toilets then head home and fall into bed together
5355549 back then samantha and lindsay didnt have a physical relationship

5355678 digital media are helping to make the world smaller spread ideas and encourage collaboration across borders and among people who otherwise might not have an opportunity to work together
5355679 to ensure support for the freshest thinking and most innovative applications of digital media to learning we have expanded this years competition to include international submissions and ideas from young people who are often the pioneers of the digital space

5355690 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5355691 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

5355698 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5355699 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
5355700 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
5355701 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
5355702 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
5355703 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

5355711 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
5355712 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
5355713 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
5355714 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
5355715 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american
5355716 wait a minute theres a difference between europe and america
5355717 its phenomenal what youve achieved in the first eight or nine years but regrettably 9 11 has put us back twenty years
5355718 there has to be a separation of religion and the state
5355719 dont borrow from the enemy islam is fine the way it is
5355720 we dont want to be completely islamic modernists because they define themselves in terms of western standards so they wind up with a westernized islam or if you will a protestanization of islam
5355721 we need to get back to our religion to reclaim our identity and values
5355722 who needs to go i know what i need to know about islam
5355723 my god this would never be allowed in the arab world
5355724 why are you going into that abracadabra field youll never get a job
5355725 how come there is no democracy or very little isnt it that theres a contradiction between islam and democracy or democracy and arab culture
5355726 i dont understand why didnt muslims turn more against the soviet union why is there more anti americanism after all the soviets are unbelievers and were believers
5355727 the reality of it is our foreign policies what government have we been associated with
5355728 its an unfocused war its a unilateral its a new empire look at whats happening the agenda is not simply to address this issue or that issue its open ended and its going to be one country determining or redrawing the map of the muslim world
5355729 no no the real purpose is to liberate iraq establish democracy and let that be an example to the rest of the middle east
5355730 look there is not a balance or a parity in terms of american foreign policy when it comes to this region
5355731 if im right youre wrong were the forces of good youre the forces of evil forces of god forces of satan
5355732 no if we have the truth and you represent untruth were the army of god and youre the army of satan then we have an obligation to pursue
5355733 yes you know something but often its that something thats coming through what i call the explosive headline events
5355734 anti americanism is broad based in the muslim world but its also broad based outside anti americanism in europe and in the muslim world does not mean hatred of america however that anti americanism does in the hands of extremists become a hatred of america that in fact advocates violence
5355735 we want to explain to people because we believe that people out there really dont understand the whole picture they dont really know what america is about
5355736 you have an obligation as a citizen let alone the opportunity as a student to explore international affairs and to attempt to make your contribution
5355737 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5355738 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
5355739 we are privileged we need to therefore sacrifice to help others who are less privileged we need to pay for our being citizens of the oppressor nation etc
5355740 look its certainly sweet that youre here and that youre trying to help and everything but what would really do us the most good is if you went back to the u s and made revolution there
5355741 oh my god they dont realize how hard that is
5355742 look you have mountains here just go to the mountains thats what we do we go to the mountains
5355743 well that might have been true in the clinton years in the nineties but now with bush and his war on terrorism post 9 11 etc what we have is imperialism in the old style
5355744 what rumsfeld wolfowitz bush etc are doing is theyre trying to prove empire wrong

5355794 demand for raw materials in the emerging market economies has remained strong
5355795 in particular china remains a key driver of global commodity consumption through its position as a net importer of raw materials

5355801 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5355802 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5355803 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors

5355845 it is apparent that judge deweese has both expanded the current display beyond the ten commandments alone and offered his views of the competing philosophies represented in the display
5355846 could there be other information or solutions that are hidden under another leaf

5355857 mobile tv services have taken off in japan and south korea where service is offered free of charge in italy where additional fees have been the norm usage has been limited
5355858 once you start charging consumers they start getting turned off
5355859 but until the iphone and ipod touch we had not seen a device compelling enough
5355860 instead of having one or two sources for information students today have thousands of resources at their fingertips it is becoming our responsibility as educators to help them navigate the mountains of information and learn how to be selective

5355881 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5355882 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5355883 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5355884 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5355885 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5355886 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

5355891 it had been taking an entirely routine flight and was on a perfectly normal approach to land at coventry
5355892 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft
5355893 we noticed it was flying low and literally within a split second we saw a light aircraft come in from the right
5355894 the twin engined aircraft struck the light aircraft and just totally destroyed it

5355899 mcbride now says these witnesses made statements while being intimidated and coerced by police we say these statements are directly relevant to the defence of the accused and why they suddenly incriminated him after exonerating him
5355900 it is very clear what happened here no blood alcohol was taken there was no medical evidence and the accused was removed from the scene the actual versions of people who say he was drunk are vital
5355901 ed note sometimes its hard to hear music as described
5355902 i need someone to help me with housing and food for the children we cant cope with this by ourselves
5355903 we already have three girls she wanted a boy i told her because of our standard of life three are enough we were barely coping with three children

5355908 there is a good doha deal still to be seized
5355909 high energy prices across the economy rising air fares and airline schedule cuts are the primary drivers of the overall reduction in passenger volumes expected for this labor day period
5355910 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
5355911 we trust that there will be a conclusion very soon there are issues that are outstanding but quite clearly one has no business in negotiating if you are not prepared to compromise
5355912 it is critical that we conclude this dialogue as a matter of urgency
5355913 lord give me your unfailing love the salvation that you promised me
5355914 its important that citizens feel there are no secrets other than extremely limited topics protected by state and federal laws
5355915 the provisions for exceptions to the open meeting requirements shall be strictly construed limited to the specific topics allowed by the law against closed meetings
5355916 board members will be given a written description of all topics to be considered in closed session at least 24 hours in advance of the meeting and in sufficient detail to allow an informed decision as to whether the topic should be handled in closed session
5355917 any decision to go into closed session must be approved by at least two thirds of the members present which rule may not be suspended
5355918 anyone denied access to county records may also appeal to the full county board for consideration at their next regularly scheduled meeting
5355919 a two thirds majority is required to sustain the denial which rule may not be suspended
5355920 to figure out the best way to get contracts online
5355921 i think openness in government is always good but it has to be weighed with the legitimate rights to privacy
5355922 i dont know if we can go beyond what the state law provides
5355923 to the best of my knowledge the county board has never opened up its closed session minutes
5355924 if you go there now the traffic is choked up at the end of the day and on ui game days because first street goes from four to two lanes

5355937 i am delighted that a1gp has taken the safety of its drivers so seriously and has committed to ensuring the cars stay at the forefront of safety technology and are willing to listen to advice from medical experts and other industry experts in order to achieve this
5355938 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5355939 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5355940 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5355941 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5355942 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5355943 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5355944 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5355945 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5355946 need to be as macho as possible in our white tights
5355947 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5355948 the russians arent withdrawing they are in the same places they are in senaki khashuri zugdidi and gori
5355949 if anyone thinks that they can kill our citizens and escape unpunished we will never allow this if anyone tries this again we will come out with a crushing response
5355950 we have all the necessary resources political economic and military if anyone had any illusions about this they have to abandon them
5355951 the continuation of the awakening councils as they are now is unacceptable
5355952 we fought the americans for four years and we fought al qaida too
5355953 we are an experienced armed group we are fully capable of bringing the house down
5355954 it has put money in the local economy and reduced attacks on coalition forces
5355955 you can see where the money is going an irrigation pump here a renovated home there
5355956 the government must listen to what the awakening councils have to say
5355957 they deserve that because of all the sacrifices they have made
5355958 we still feel theres a small group were not reaching
5355959 school breakfast really is the most important meal of the day
5355960 hes able to make people miss in the open field we both are able to do that you can kind of think of us as salt and pepper thunder and lightning
5355961 with me being the starter coach is always talking about trust when shaun comes in i can trust that hes going to be able to play at the same level that i am and thats going to take our team to great places were just going to try to be the best running back combo in the nation
5355962 non capisco il mio esercizio era da podio mi hanno derubato
5355963 andrea e matteo hanno fatto due esercizi uno pi bello dellaltro non mi sta bene la classifica perch un italiano doveva stare sul podio non sono daccordo con la seconda posizione del cinese wei yang se guardiamo al rallentatore si capisce che i valori che gli hanno assegnato non sono giusti eseguendo una rondine non ha rispettato le regole passando da un appoggio a una posizione statica anche lucraino oleksandr vorobiov medaglia di bronzo non ha fatto un bella uscita
5355964 i was close enough and i heard a couple of conversations now that i know what i know i dont really think that paul really went after her for anything
5355965 she had basically nothing she had tapes of her being in the studio with him her being on the road with him private moments
5355966 she told me a bunch of stuff but i dont see him being a violent person
5355967 i was thrilled to collaborate with kiehls ive been a fan since i first moved to new york city their products blend the traditional and the innovative and embrace luxury and functionality when designing the travel kit i was inspired by kiehls elegant simplicity and created something to help make traveling as effortless as possible

5355969 letzten endes l sst sich mehr geld mit mobilen diensten als mit herk mmlichen desktop anwendungen machen
5355970 aufgrund der rivalit t dieser beiden nationen und angesichts der qualit t der spieler werden beide teams ab der ersten minute versuchen das spiel an sich zu rei en
5355971 sowohl die argentinier als auch wir verf gen ber spieler mit gro artigen kreativen f higkeiten deshalb gehe ich davon aus dass es ein gro es spektakel werden wird
5355972 ich glaube nicht dass sich diese beiden spiele miteinander vergleichen lassen jedes turnier ist anders vor allem olympische spiele haben ein eigenes flair der spielverlauf ist kaum vorherzusagen aber ich w rde dieses spiel nicht als ma stab heranziehen
5355973 batista macht bei dieser mannschaft einen gro artigen job das hat man im bisherigen turnierverlauf ganz klar gesehen der einzige unterschied ist dass ich auch die a nationalmannschaft trainiere
5355974 das l sst sich ganz einfach erkl ren es handelt sich hier um das aufeinandertreffen zweier mannschaften die bereits eine vielzahl an titeln gewonnen haben und bei gro en turnieren f r gew hnlich immer die finalphase erreichen die rivalit t ist historischen ursprungs die erwartungshaltung vor einem spiel ist auf beiden seiten riesengro dieses spiel ist hier keine ausnahme
5355975 diese mannschaft wei genau dass wir nicht ganz ohne probleme hierher kamen sie wird daher diesen moment zu sch tzen wissen die spieler sind selbstbewusst und wissen worum es geht das ist sehr wichtig um ein positives ergebnis zu erreichen
5355976 der markt reagiert bei pfleiderer aber auf jede nachricht die nur entfernt mit bernahmespekulationen in verbindung stehen k nnte in diesem fall irrt der markt allerdings denn die beteiligung bel uft sich weiter auf 21 75 lediglich die struktur hat sich ge ndert
5355977 i am surprised hes holding out i dont know where hes getting his advice hes played four years and hes played every game once and hes been hurt three times i know if i was in the front office even if it wasnt steven even if it was someone else on another team it would be hard for me to justify giving them a lot of money regardless if he was the team
5355978 it would be a mistake for the world economy and harmful for developing countries not to retrieve it
5355979 there is too much at stake to let this problem derail a global trade package that could expand economic growth and opportunity by cutting subsidies drastically lowering tariffs significantly and opening up services markets
5355980 i am as excited about this season as ive been about a team
5355981 i feel like we have the right people on the bus and we have them in the right seats everyone in the program is working really hard and i feel like all the pieces of the puzzle are coming together
5355982 kat had as good a spring as shes ever had
5355983 she is a workhorse for us and has decreased her errors and become more consistent the experience she gained last year as the no 1 outside hitter has given her a lot of confidence going into her senior year
5355984 cinthia is going to be a nice addition to this program
5355985 she is quick athletic dynamic and a good passer we are really excited about her i think she fits a need that we have in terms of ball control she is also a good defensive player
5355986 its hard to explain how valuable it is to get six months of training before your freshman year sarah needed to make some technical changes and she changed positions when she came to college she has made a lot of progress and gained a lot of experience
5355987 stephanie was thrown into the fire last year and came out of it alive
5355988 physically and mentally she is a whole different player than she was a year ago
5355989 abby is one of the top setters out of arizona
5355990 she is a nice quick athlete who has good size and good hands there is always a learning curve with freshman setters so the faster she can get in and learn our system the better it will be for us we are excited about her
5355991 its nice going into this season with two setters well let them compete on the court in the preseason the position is much more settled than it was a year ago
5355992 by the end of the spring emillie was at 95 percent and she will be 100 percent by august
5355993 you cant put a value on how much she brings to the team and to the court
5355994 like kat the experience lori gained as one of our go to players has turned her into a completely different player than she was a year ago shes playing with so much confidence playing on the right side this spring we were able to get her significantly more sets so thats a move were going to consider loris whole game has developed and were going to find a way to utilize everything that she can do
5355995 karolina runs the slide so well off one foot that we want to utilize that strength
5355996 she can be a big offensive player for us because of that karolina made progress in her conditioning which is going to make a big difference for her in her sophomore season
5355997 chelsey was our most improved player for the second year in a row she has made herself into a really good division i player between lori karolina and chelsea all three of them are training in the middle and on the right side and its going to be competitive
5355998 she worked really hard and has improved her game a lot we are excited about mirandas size and athleticism and think that shes going to be a valuable plaer in this program
5355999 jen used the redshirt year to really improve every aspect of her skills and conditioning
5356000 she puts up a big block for us as she improves the rest of her game her ability to contribute is going to increase
5356001 we knew when we recruited keisha that she could play in just about every position and thats what shes been doing for us
5356002 she spent the spring learning the defensive system so that she can take more responsibility there playing setter helped prepare her to play libero because she had a big responsibility at setter and did a tremendous job shes going to be a very good libero for us and we are excited about her in that position
5356003 stephanie is a much improved player from when she first got here in terms of skills and conditioning
5356004 she has improved the whole aspect of her game and has become a leader on our team we have watched corinne for a long time and she is a nice defensive player she plays in a club that runs the same system so she comes in fairly prepared as a freshman
5356005 we have three very good teams at the utah classic and santa clara the first weekend will also be an important game for us
5356006 at new mexico state we have the opportunity to play texas which probably has the most size of any team in the country they are a legitimate final four team next year and it will be exciting to play them new mexico state is a solid program it will be a good match up between a good mwc team and a good wac team
5356007 our conference finished fourth in the country in rpi last season
5356008 thats big time although csu byu and utah have always had a stronghold on the conference unlv broke into that last year and new mexico and tcu are both knocking on the door that strength is good for everyone in the conference
5356009 let me repeat liu xiang will not withdraw unless the pain is unbearable
5356010 everyone expected liu to do well as well as he did four years ago
5356011 we could see he wasnt quite as strong as you expect him to be
5356012 but we didnt know it was as bad as it turned out to be
5356013 after liu xiangs injury i wont bother coming back to the birds nest for more
5356014 and will encourage him to come back to the track
5356015 i think they will be disappointed but they will understand
5356016 i just came here to compete and take the gold i dont care whos on the track
5356017 en esta zona se ven an produciendo 80 mil toneladas de arroz al a o s lo estaban regadas 12 mil hect reas este a o estamos regando 30 mil hect reas y se est n produciendo 172 mil toneladas cuando el sistema est completo se producir n 300 mil toneladas de arroz al a o
5356018 el gobierno muestra cero tolerancia y rechaza el principio de ganar medallas a toda costa
5356019 es obvio que hay una red ilegal de dopaje y que el gobierno griego debe de actuar
5356020 individualistic societies have tended to do better economically but what happens if collectivist societies snap out of their economic stagnation what happens if collectivist societies especially those in asia rise economically and come to rival the west a new sort of global conversation develops
5356021 are you maggie lisa is so very sorry she cant be here she sent these flowers for you though

5356036 i think personally that a dj is preferable when there is going to be a high content of hip hop rap house etc likewise songs that feature a lot of heavy processing sampling bass coming out the wazoo etc will benefit being played by a dj some of the bands will keep up with a select amount of the current hits usually the really popular tunes but given todays shelf life of the average song its difficult to keep abreast as well we do run into clients that have never danced to a live band before and are not sure how it will go songs played by djs will sound exactly like the original but bands will often put their own stamp on the song and have the ability to lengthen or shorten a song as necessary of course given that on an average 4 hour night the client is going to hear between 40 80 songs both a dj and band can usually handle the requirements

5356055 the solution to this problem we face is too big for me to come up with a quick solution one that i am then going to commit our nation to rather i would like us to brainstorm i would like us all together to apply our intelligence to the issue to look at it from all sides to hear the voices of many and through that dialogue process to allow a direction and decision of action to emerge

5356062 ann l the law project for psychiatric rights psychrights today announced the launch of its effort to recruit pro bono attorneys to help defend new york citizens facing the horror of forced psychiatric drugging in the community
5356063 people think forced drugging makes the community safer but the opposite is true it is well established that psychiatric drugs forced on people increase rather than decrease violence
5356064 the idea that forced community psychiatric drugging makes people safer is a fraud perpetrated on the public by organizations like the treatment advocacy center
5356065 we hope members of the new york bar will read the memorandum and decide this is an issue deserving of pro bono services
5356066 we are very pleased to collaborate with psychrights combining legal advocacy and grass roots activism
5356067 if nothing else attorneys should be offended by the sham nature of the legal proceedings in which new york citizens are ordered by the courts to take these very debilitating largely ineffective and extremely harmful drugs

5356080 esta fue una victoria bastante amarga para el gobierno no s lo porque el proyecto es malo y no se est gastando bien la plata sino porque si finalmente esto se cambia en el senado va a comisi n mixta y ah nosotros ya deber amos haber recuperado la mayor a que no tuvimos por la ausencia del diputado eduardo d az por lo mismo el gobierno tiene que entender que debe sentarse a conversar
5356081 hasta ahora no ha existido ninguna conversaci n con el gobierno
5356082 disponibilidad para conversar especialmente si se acepta la mediaci n de sebasti n pi era
5356083 siempre conversamos y nos reunimos con el comit independiente no buscamos convencer a nadie cada uno responde por su votaci n pero s tenemos la convicci n de que este es un muy mal proyecto y en consecuencia esperamos que sea rechazado
5356084 en la c mara la discusi n fue un reality show y en el senado se deber an dejar atr s las trincheras pol ticas y tanto la alianza como la concertaci n deber an asumir una posici n seria y discutir el proyecto en su m rito

5356090 creo que qued algo muy claro en estos d as que las autoridades nacionales y regionales deben hablar de cara a la ciudadan a para explicarle los planes y las dificultades que a veces tenemos para sacarlos adelante y que si alguien quiere oponerse a tal o cual proyecto la ciudadan a sepa qui nes son y por qu lo hacen yo creo que eso es algo que la ciudadan a necesita y que le es extraordinariamente til sobre todo cuando estamos hablando de leyes que van en beneficio de la gente
5356091 la tarea de explicar lo que hace el gobierno es de todos los d as y los intendentes van a dar una conferencia de prensa el mi rcoles o jueves para explicarle a la ciudadan a por qu se perdi el proyecto qui n vot a favor qui n vot en contra de inscripci n autom tica

5356102 should posterity inquire why their ancestors destitute of military education or experience abandoned their peaceful abodes to encounter the perils of uncertain warfare let them be told it was not to execute the mandates of a tyrant in subjugating their fellow men but it was in defence of our most precious rights and privileges it was a display of that genuine patriotism and true glory which it is ever most honourable to venerate and cherish while their own hearts glow with patriotic fervor let them reflect that true glory consists in the love of peace and the culture of benevolence and good will to men let their souls hold in detestation every species of warfare save that which may secure and defend the invaluable heritage which their fathers have bequeathed them and for which their memories should be embalmed with the incense of gratitude

5356179 certain vested interests began an atmosphere of confrontation and of vendetta they blamed me of hatching conspiracies from aiwan e sadr

5356181 i publicly announced support to the government and offered to share all my experience with them to help address complicated issues it was confronting
5356182 the coalition considered me a problem and not a solution
5356183 are they afraid of me or my obligations under the constitution

5356191 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me
5356192 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5356193 and in matters of national security good judgment will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5356194 bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5356195 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5356196 as president i will do all that is in my power to ensure that those who serve today and those who have served in the past have access to the highest quality health mental health and rehabilitative care in the world
5356197 and i will not accept a situation in which veterans are denied access to care on account of travel distances backlogs of appointments and years of pending disability evaluation and claims we should no longer tolerate requiring veterans to make an appointment to stand in one line for a ticket to stand in another

5356217 pat wenn wir zur ckblicken auf ungarn wie kann man die performance des teams bewerten
5356218 ich denke dass das vielleicht unser st rkstes ergebnis der saison war zwar war nelson piquets ergebnis am hockenheimring vom papier her besser wir waren aber die ersten die darauf hingewiesen haben dass dabei auch das gl ck eine gro e rolle gespielt hat in ungarn war es etwas ganz anderes da beide autos das ganze rennen ber stark waren sie konnten es mit starken gegner aufnehmen das auto war dort auf anhieb konkurrenzf hig wir hatten eine gute qualifikation wir hatten ein gutes rennen und mussten die strategie nutzen um unser gutes ergebnis zu holen die punkte waren uns nat rlich willkommen und in den vergangenen beiden rennen hat nur mclaren mehr punkte geholt als wir
5356219 fernando alonso hat dort das beste ergebnis des jahres wiederholt gehen wir das wochenende noch einmal durch
5356220 fernando hatte wieder ein starkes wochenende die einzige entt uschung war dass er am ende kimi r ikk nen nicht mehr hinter sich halten k nnte nat rlich ist klar dass r ikk nen ein viel st rkeres auto hatte aber ich dachte wirklich dass wir genug getan hatten um nach dem zweiten boxenstopp vor ihm zu bleiben am ende ist der plan nicht ganz aufgegangen und wir haben einen m glichen podiumsplatz nicht erreicht aber trotzdem war es ein tolles ergebnis von fernando der mit platz vier sein bisher bestes ergebnis aus australien egalisiert hat
5356221 nelson hat an seine gute form von hockenheim ankn pfen k nnen
5356222 nach hockenheim haben wir alle gehofft dass er neues selbstvertrauen hat und das war auch der fall er war ruhig er war zuversichtlich und er ist mit dem festen glauben daran dass er es in q3 schafft ins qualifying gegangen dann ist er ein genauso perfektes rennen gefahren wie in hockenheim ohne signifikante fehler zu machen er war schnell wenn es n tig war und hat die reifen geschont wenn das n tig war er ist ein starkes und intelligentes rennen gefahren
5356223 die verbesserungen sind in den letzten rennen st ck f r st ck gekommen
5356224 dem team ist es gelungen die pace aus dem qualifying ins rennen zu bertragen wird sich das auch in der restlichen saison gelingen
5356225 man muss bedenken dass ungarn eine sehr spezielle strecke ist auch wenn fernando r ikk nen lange zeit hinter sich gehalten hat kann man daraus nicht auf die pace der beiden autos schlie en sobald r ikk nen vor uns war konnte er wesentlich schnellere runden fahren aber das wochenende hat gezeigt dass die pace des r28 gesteigert wurde die verbesserungen sind in den letzten rennen st ck f r st ck gekommen deshalb verst rkt die performance von ungarn unseren glauben daran dass wir uns in die richtige richtung bewegen ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir die saison als vierte in der meisterschaft und mit dem drittschnellsten auto beenden k nnen
5356226 hat sich in ungarn etwas an der hackordnung ge ndert
5356227 wir haben gesehen dass bmw ein schlechtes wochenende hatte und toyota ein gutes ich denke aber nicht dass sich die hackordnung pl tzlich ndert sicherlich gibt es aber trends im moment verzeichnen wir einen deutlichen aufw rtstrend w hrend es bei bmw etwas abw rts geht und toyota etwas schwankt ich denke nicht dass das rennen selbst eine nderung des status quo widerspiegelt aber es entsprach doch den trends die sich seit einer weile entwickeln
5356228 das rennteam hatte eine kurze pause deshalb sind alle hei darauf dass es wieder losgeht
5356229 jetzt geht es nach valencia ein heimrennen f r fernando freut sich das team darauf
5356230 wir freuen uns auf jedes rennen und wir m gen die herausforderung auf einer neuen strecke zu fahren wir besuchen gern neue st dte das rennteam hatte eine kurze pause deshalb sind alle hei darauf dass es wieder losgeht es ist ganz sicher eine fabelhafte strecke
5356231 valencia ist f r alle neu erh ht das die chancengleichheit
5356232 die teams sind es alle gewohnt auf neue strecken zu gehen von daher ist das f r keinen ein vor oder nachteil ich w rde sagen dass eine neue strecke viel mehr ein test ist wie schnell sich ein team auf neue rahmenbedingungen einstellen kann das ist einer der gr nde warum ich die herausforderung neuer kurse so mag
5356233 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5356234 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5356235 customs officials continued to monitor for the smuggling of bibles and other religious material into the country
5356236 religious texts published without authorization including bibles and qurans may be confiscated
5356237 i have spoken clearly candidly and consistently with chinas leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights
5356238 and i have met repeatedly with chinese dissidents and religious believers the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
5356239 we firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries
5356240 keeps to the concept of putting peoples interest first and is devoted to maintaining and promoting basic rights and freedom of its citizens
5356241 chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law
5356242 were being inconvenienced a little but its nothing compared to what our brothers and sisters in china experience for their faith in jesus christ
5356243 there are all sorts of things that would be comforting i expect an injection of morphine would be comforting but to say that something is comforting is not to say that its true
5356244 if atheism is a religion then health is a disease
5356245 the habit of religion is oppressive an easy way out of thought

5356293 if you need a jolt of summer memories to sustain you through the long winter this video captures those moments and sounds
5356294 the photography is stunning particularly the ocean breaking on the rocks below and the wide vistas of the marginal way and beach beyond all enhanced by a beautiful sound track
5356295 they gave me a list and i interviewed 15 people
5356296 everybodys emotional connection to the marginal way moved me closer to understanding what formed the soul of ogunquit i was taken aback by so many little stories a lot of community involvement and concern
5356297 i have yet to have had a project that moved me as much as this project i had the benefit of not being political i was there to discover and convey the experience of the marginal way i was absolutely unbiased as i looked at this treasure
5356298 eeuu y el reino unido intentan veladamente tergiversar el contenido del acuerdo
5356299 the support weve had all year everybodys recognized that we had a shot at this thing such enthusiasm such support and thats a big motivator to us
5356300 we all say thank you very much to those who support it and those who believe in us

5356311 a great deal still depends on the decisions and good judgment of the next president
5356312 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5356313 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5356314 the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5356315 first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5356316 both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5356317 because he has the judgment vision and character to lead this country in the 21st century these veterans will play a prominent role in denver at the democratic national convention lead veterans for obama efforts in the states participate in grass roots fundraising efforts and serve as surrogates before veterans and general audiences across america
5356318 the feeling for sure is very happy for being no 1 but the feeling doesnt change too much because the last years i did very well too
5356319 is in the middle of one of the greatest careers our industry has ever seen
5356320 united artists will continue to make the films under the credit facility and theres not going to be any changes

5356343 andrew sullivan brought a big dose of cultural originality to the journal
5356344 superdelegates werent counting how many of their constituents had voted for senator clinton or senator obama but rather how much money was being put into their war chests by the obama campaign and the democratic hierarchy this money moved from one candidate to another via pacs would determine their endorsements and ultimately the nomination
5356345 republican john mccain and democrat barack obama are neck and neck in colorado solidifying the state as a key swing area that will be pivotal in deciding who becomes the next president of the u s overall coloradans favored mccain 44 percent to 41 percent but the gap was within the polls margin of error of plus or minus 4 38 percentage points mccain also had a slightly higher approval rating 55 percent to 53 percent also within the margin of error
5356346 party unity is an issue for obama in the buckeye state while mccain has an 89 7 lead with voters who identify as republicans obama has a narrower 75 17 edge with democrats delving deeper into the numbers it appears that residual unhappiness from hillary clinton supporters could be the cause

5356359 i didnt know that my social security and pretty much everything else everybody needed to get whatever they wanted from me
5356360 there is a good chance under the law that there are public records available for anybody to come in and get
5356361 identify for us what it is you want redacted from it relative to your social security number or bank account number and at no cost we will redact that information before we ever give that out to the public
5356362 i do have two different social security numbers for you ones corporate and im assuming one is your birth one and the one i have here is xxx xx xxxx that is correct
5356363 do you have any idea on how i would have gotten this information
5356364 the only vital record that has a social security number that the public can see is a death record
5356365 i have no idea if theres a way to change them
5356366 most agencies including our own will redact any personal identifiable information to protect the public and we certainly do that on a routine basis so when it comes to public records that does not mean that anyone can request that personal information and get it
5356367 when you have these documents in a governmental repository and it does require the affirmative step of an individual coming in there looking up the records and then copying down the information or making a copy of the record that serves somewhat as a deterrent

5356435 women and older adults not the proverbial nerdy teenage boys are the new driving force behind the success of the video games industry

5356462 people in both campaigns get carried away and say things they shouldnt have said
5356463 the story of how a 16 year low grade conflict over who should rule two small mountainous regions in the caucasus erupted into the most serious post cold war showdown between the united states and russia is one of miscalculation missed signals and overreaching according to interviews with diplomats and senior officials in the united states the european union russia and georgia in many cases the officials would speak only on the condition of anonymity
5356464 with a vastly more confident russia flush with oil money a booming economy and a rebuilt military no longer bogged down in chechnya the stars were aligned for a confrontation in which russia could with a quick show of force teach a lesson to the united states georgia and all of the former soviet satellites and republics seeking closer ties with the west
5356465 broad and spacious is the road leading off into destruction and many are the ones going in through it
5356466 and so now you know the thing that acts as a restraint with a view to his being revealed in his own due time 7 true the mystery of this lawlessness is already at work but only till he who is right now acting as a restraint gets to be out of the way 8 then indeed the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus will do away with by the spirit of his mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of his presence 9 but the lawless ones presence is according to the operation of satan with every powerful work and lying signs and portents 10 and with every unrighteous deception for those who are perishing as a retribution because they did not accept the love of the truth that they might be saved 11 so that is why god lets an operation of error go to them that they may get to believing the lie 12 in order that they all may be judged because they did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness
5356467 if now the good news we declare is in fact veiled it is veiled among those who are perishing 4 among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers that the illumination of the glorious good news about the christ who is the image of god might not shine through

5356473 the junction was altered last september with the aim of improving the flow of traffic
5356474 but while the scheme has helped vehicles merge more freely from the a556 there have been increased delays on the main carriageway
5356475 to combat this problem the highways agency is now planning to reinstate three lanes on the main carriageway and adapt the hard shoulder to provide a long auxiliary lane for traffic joining the motorway from the a556
5356476 the changes to the junction layout are causing chaos for commuters trying to get to work
5356477 the enormous increase in congestion is adding more than 30 minutes to a journey that used to take an hour
5356478 ive generally had a trouble free journey of about an hour each way but since the changes it has become a nightmare
5356479 traffic was fine until this disaster of a decision its morning mayhem and accidents will almost certainly happen
5356480 we have monitored and evaluated the scheme and listened to drivers which is why we are embarking on this new work
5356481 we understand the frustration of motorists using this route over the last few months and we appreciate not only their feedback but also their patience during the preparation of the new scheme
5356482 although its not possible to eradicate delays entirely the changes we intend to make should improve the situation significantly
5356483 it should be made very clear to you that the use of the zanjeer is not essential or necessary
5356484 the aim of the whole festival is to bring genuine feelings of bereavement and grief in the participants and the watchers about what happened to hussain and all his family at the battle of karbala 1 400 years ago

5356487 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorises its experiences this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
5356488 one of the fundamental questions that scientists are facing today is how we link the activity of individual neurons with the complex behaviours that we see in whole organisms this project gives us a really unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons hopefully we can use that to go some of the way to answer some of these very fundamental questions

5356492 there were only five biosafety level 4 labs places equipped to study highly lethal agents such as ebola that have no human vaccine or treatment a government accountability office report stated last fall fifteen are in operation or under construction now according to the report there are hundreds more biosafety level 3 labs which handle agents such as bacillus anthracis which does have a human vaccine
5356493 clearances to work with select biological agents such as bacillus anthracis many of them civilians working at private universities

5356499 industrial meals are all around us after all they make up the food chain from which most of us eat most of the time
5356500 these days 19 percent of american meals are eaten in the car
5356501 the myriad streams of commodity corn after being variously processed and turned into meat converged in all sorts of different meals i might have eaten at kfc or pizza hut or applebees or prepared myself from ingredients bought at the supermarket
5356502 corns triumph is the direct result of its overproduction and that has been a disaster for the people who grow it
5356503 i figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers i need to shape up fast
5356504 are you looking to lose weight or do you want to increase strength and flexibility as well
5356505 uh mr b helen said you wanted to see me

5356507 ooh its the deep burn oh its so deep ooh i can hardly lift my arms cause i did so many i dont know if you heard me counting i did over a thousand
5356508 its for paris im on this new diet i eat nothing and when i feel like im going to faint i eat a cube of cheese im just one stomach flu away from my goal weight
5356509 i didnt realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot belly
5356510 no a pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla but on a woman a pot belly is very sexy
5356511 theres an old joke two women go to a catskill mountain resort and one of them says boy the food at this place is terrible
5356512 i want you to think of what you ate today got it now cut that in half this is called a diet people everyone starts one today d you should stop eating you see when you skip a meal your body feeds off its fat stores and if you skip enough maybe you body will eat your a
5356513 are you crazy we cant have pizza and beer do you know how many calories youre talking about
5356514 duh its lite beer and shes going to throw it up anyway
5356515 because you whine like one turns to speaker 3 and no one can lift your fat a youre on a diet starting now
5356516 i feel like such a heifer i had two bowls of special k three strips of turkey bacon a handful of popcorn five peanut butter m amp ms and like three pieces of licorice
5356517 i still see things i just choose not to acknowledge them its like a diet of the mind i choose not to indulge in certain appetites
5356518 actually im trying this new fat free diet i invented all ive had to eat for the last six days are gummi bears jelly beans and candy corn
5356519 i will fast for my penance for my part in arousing such emotion and i will not stop until they stop
5356520 no i want that feeling the feeling that comes over a man when he gets exactly what he desires i need that feeling
5356521 they lived their whole lives in a cruel and sunless world in those days they believed that the sooner they grew large and fat the sooner theyd be taken into their paradise a place so wonderful that no one ever thought to come back

5356524 questo accordo internazionale pone fine a tutte le dispute pendenti tra tripoli e washington
5356525 today is not exactly the time to address this issue after the sorrow that has struck roma there will be another time to address this
5356526 i have positive memories and i am sorry with what has happened all the players will stay and have always stayed close to the sensi family its hard to find words at this difficult time
5356527 i like to get on with them the players chat a lot and see them happy
5356528 that and the fact youre doing something you like is what matters if the teams not happy with me and if i see somethings not right then id be the first to step aside
5356529 and with el tata assistant jose luis brown here weve got a great chance as players weve already shown what we have to give for the shirt and now we want to do the same in another capacity
5356530 i won two and lost two so i came out even
5356531 its a special rivalry and it doesnt matter whos in better form going into the games either side can win theres a lot of mutual respect and im sure we both would have preferred to avoid each other until the final
5356532 let me make something clear though brazil arent any better than argentina even if they have won the last few meetings theyve just been having a good run like we did back in the 90s
5356533 we didnt play well and although we suffered a lot we beat a very tough rival it felt special as it always does when we beat brazil but they feel the same way too when they beat us
5356534 he was already a great coach out on the pitch he was a real organiser and he could hit the ball really hard
5356535 he wasnt the most gifted player but he had character and he ran the team i dont remember having any run ins with him he was tough but he was a gentleman too
5356536 hes been criticised for the way brazil have been playing but i wouldnt lay the blame on him there arent any pushovers in world football any more and if you go out and play jogo bonito and end up losing then the critics are going to kill you thats the way football is today sadly so you have to be patient and tread carefully he knows that and thats how they won the last copa america for example
5356537 both teams will be checking each other out but theres sure to be some good football because of all the great players on show
5356538 well be going out to win the game but we wont be na ve
5356539 im sure brazil will sit back just like they did in the copa america final and if they do then why should we go and expose ourselves if theyre not going to attack well be pushing forward but well be doing it patiently and well be ready for them when they try and hit us on the break
5356540 who wouldnt want to have messi riquelme aguero or mascherano and thats just to name a few theyve got some great players too though like ronaldinho alexandre pato marcelo and anderson and theyve got our respect
5356541 i love it here the club wants to sign me and there wont be any problems on that front i will be a chelsea player for the rest of my career i wanted to put negotiations to bed for now because i want to concentrate on my performances and play well its not nice for the fans to have an ongoing thing
5356542 i know i have to step it up again football is a game that doesnt stand still i performed well last season and the fans voted me player of the year but thats all in the past it was important to have a good game against portsmouth
5356543 the main thing was that the team got a good result but i am competing for a place in the squad and you want to play well
5356544 i have always thrived on pressure i love competing and learning from big players
5356545 its early days but this result makes a point we watched united beat fulham 5 1 two years ago and we all thought united are going to be really strong im sure they now think the same about us
5356546 ja nou ik vind het gewoon heel demotiverend als ik niet wordt opgesteld boehoe
5356547 wat doe jij nou ja en waarom doe je dat nou en wat denk je dat daar niet goed aan is ja denk je dat
5356548 more sensible than comparable five star travel experiences on land since at sea meals and entertainment are included
5356549 nothing against being signed to a major label but most of the time its about what they want you to do as opposed to what the artist wants to do i have nothing against jive but i really just wanted to be me seriously i got tired of being held back
5356550 of course there is a happiness that comes with independence but i also felt more confident in the studio
5356551 i was able to work at my own pace choose my collaborators and sing the truth kedar and i have been working together forever and we know how to make a great soul record
5356552 ive developed many close relationships with some of the best in the business
5356553 when it came time for me to go into the studio i was able to call on my friends like puffy bryan michael cox and video director billie woodruff to come through
5356554 i only like working with people who can take their art to the next level but believe me getting all the right folks for this project was a blessing
5356555 all of us know what its like to be feeling somebody who might not be feeling you
5356556 for a lot of guys its not about what they have but what they want
5356557 they passed along some tracks and i was really digging what these guys were doing i mixed the song myself in a home studio i have owned for about eight years i call it simply joes crib studio
5356558 i like doing things quickly and in the home studio i can get in the zone and work at my own pace
5356559 i recorded that song with trey songz and mario because you almost never hear r amp b guys singing together
5356560 i remember how hyped i was when quincy jones put out the secret garden and i wanted that kind of vibe on the record
5356561 though i dont play on this project im working on something special right now where im playing everything in the studio
5356562 the artists who are my heroes be it marvin prince or donny were never too proud to reveal there true selves it is impossible to be a true artists if your art isnt honest although it might hurt sometimes i have no problem baring the realness of my life in the songs
5356563 i spend a lot of time overseas and those sounds are as much a part of my influence as soul or gospel i want to experiment and mix a little of that flavor with what i do best
5356564 bryan and i have worked together a few times in the past and obviously his track record speaks for itself
5356565 its great that people are able to marry each other whether you are gay or straight

5356574 it is a tough start but we look forward to the big challenges and hopefully we will rise to them as we normally do
5356575 we have given everybody a head start and now we are playing catch up but we have been in this position before it is only day one of a long season
5356576 were pretty excited about finishing pool play undefeated and getting onto the medal round
5356577 we are healthy i think the team has played well and we are very excited about getting into the medal round it is time to win a gold medal
5356578 i just had to get myself going running the floor and getting deep in the paint and going right into the shot and being a big presence for the team
5356579 what we have seen is they us play extremely hard on the defensive end they are very unselfish they always find the open guy and they also shot the three point very well
5356580 when they have these three things great defense share the ball and shoot the ball well they are unbeatable
5356581 were in a tournament and now we get to play the best team in the world and have a swing at the big dog im confident we are going to go out there and play ball

5356593 he sang as he watched and waited til his billy boiled
5356594 when we started negotiations with him he had got a strain in his left thigh in training with everton just before they went to america
5356595 the problem was that during the negotiations there was a break in his treatment which wasnt exactly advantageous
5356596 we werent allowed to treat him and he wasnt getting treated at everton
5356597 we started the treatment on him as soon as we could but that was five days after the incident and unfortunately that probably cost us a week
5356598 had he had continuous treatment i am sure he would have been fit for the hull game

5356604 we think they went into iran for additional training and to be resourced and we expect that those leaders will try to come back at some point in time in the future
5356605 even though we anticipate that some of these leaders will attempt to return soon we know that they will be returning to a much less permissive environment
5356606 i need someone to help me with housing and food for the children we cant cope with this by ourselves
5356607 we already have three girls she wanted a boy i told her because of our standard of life three are enough we were barely coping with three children
5356608 as of now were playing the game monday if the storm runs in its current path tuesday would be in doubt we should know monday night about tuesday
5356609 there is no talk about moving games to another city after monday the angels possibly could go to miami or atlanta that depends on the path of the storm and whether we have to evacuate
5356610 i think its the only downside to having the record that we have right now
5356611 it certainly limits our options in such a way that its extremely unrealistic to expect that we will be able to get something done in august
5356612 in the past when something like this happened you would renegotiate and sign a player for a lesser amount
5356613 now major league baseball has stepped in and said the player will be suspended for a year and that he cant sign with another team
5356614 but the moment that triggered the current armed hostilities was the georgian invasion of south ossetia this should not be glossed over
5356615 rest is not idleness and to lie sometimes on the grass under the trees on a summers day listening to the murmur of water or watching the clouds float across the sky is by no means a waste of time
5356616 had srk utilised comparable parameter to minefill it is probable in our view that the overall resource would have increased in size
5356617 indeed srk has idenitified areas within the resource shell where additional infill drilling i e tighter drill spacing has the potential to increase the resource tonnage by approximately 15 to 20

5356631 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5356632 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5356633 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5356634 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5356635 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children

5356655 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5356656 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5356657 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5356658 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria

5356702 a number of hessians and waldeckers have fallen into our hands the german officers and soldiers by a finesse of the british to increase their ferocity had been led to believe that americans are savages and barbarians and if taken would have their bodies stuck full of pieces of dry wood and in that manner burnt to death but they were very agreeably disappointed and much pleased on meeting civil and kind treatment
5356703 our enemy was told we would torture them if they were caught even if they never had a trial and were not convicted of anything and found that americans were savages and barbarians

5356718 lee williams falls in the category of traditional quartet style gospel
5356719 hes one of the few artists in america who commands ones attention from the stage they dont run up and down the aisles they dont jump the pews they stand there and spread the word
5356720 i was speaking with dottie peebles and some other big names in gospel and they were saying theyve done concerts with lee williams they leave the stage sweating after performing and they get a little scattered but when lee williams hits the stage everybody runs back inside

5356747 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5356748 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5356749 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5356750 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5356751 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5356752 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5356753 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5356754 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do

5356756 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5356757 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5356758 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5356759 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5356760 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5356761 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5356762 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5356763 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5356764 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5356765 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5356766 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5356767 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds

5356769 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5356770 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5356771 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5356772 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5356773 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5356774 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5356775 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5356776 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5356777 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5356778 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5356779 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5356780 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5356781 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5356782 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them

5356787 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5356788 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5356789 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5356790 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5356791 for many years they viewed success in the wrong metric
5356792 they have all this information they should have been able to help people
5356793 progressive nature of the tax struck at the heart of the economic life of the individual punishing that special effort and extra hard work that has always been the driving force of our economy taxation fell most cruelly on the poor making a difficult climb up from poverty even harder
5356794 the georgians live like kings while we are forced to live like beggars
5356795 i was told we were going on a training mission but here i am in georgia fighting my brothers
5356796 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5356797 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5356798 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5356799 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5356800 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5356801 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5356802 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5356803 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5356804 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5356805 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5356806 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5356807 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5356808 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
5356809 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection

5356812 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5356813 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5356814 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5356815 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5356816 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5356817 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5356818 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5356819 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5356820 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5356821 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5356822 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5356823 here is an excellent example of the us progressive rock scene of the seventies having both technique and excellence imagination amp talent

5356827 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5356828 the coalition has decided that i am part of the problem and not the solution
5356829 i could fight back and answer back but that may have led to deepening uncertainty
5356830 no one knew us no one spoke to us and no one listened to us now we have put pakistan on the map and people take notice
5356831 this country faced unprecedented challenges and i turned every challenge into an opportunity im leaving satisfied with my actions
5356832 weve seen a significant dollar strengthening over the last couple of weeks
5356833 weakness in developed economies translates into weakness in developing ones

5356836 the photography is stunning particularly the ocean breaking on the rocks below and the wide vistas of the marginal way and beach beyond all enhanced by a beautiful sound track
5356837 they gave me a list and i interviewed 15 people
5356838 everybodys emotional connection to the marginal way moved me closer to understanding what formed the soul of ogunquit i was taken aback by so many little stories a lot of community involvement and concern
5356839 i have yet to have had a project that moved me as much as this project i had the benefit of not being political i was there to discover and convey the experience of the marginal way i was absolutely unbiased as i looked at this treasure

5356861 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5356862 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5356863 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

5356878 he has looked lively very happy and full of desire and the coach bernd schuster has told me that he is training very well
5356879 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 35 for whoever wants to save his life c will lose it but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it 36 what good is it for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul 37 or what can a man give in exchange for his soul 38 if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his fathers glory with the holy angels
5356880 multiple sources said that labels have cut back on long term contracts with guaranteed money new deals tend to be more performance driven and are often limited to 2 to 3 years in length
5356881 this generous donation is really really going to make a difference to helping us get back to playing conditions fixing everything and getting the kids back to playing ball again
5356882 thats why were hoping the 5 000 donation jump starts this and lays the ground work and hopefully other community leaders and organizations will take our lead and whatever they can do to step up to the plate to also help out
5356883 we are talking about pulling back to the territory of south ossetia there should be no troops on the territory of georgia
5356884 we used to have there one light infantry battalion less than 600 people certainly it will be more soldiers but not just soldiers the force must be credible to prevent any further escalation of conflict there

5356890 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives
5356891 it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5356892 boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5356893 young people need to understand that carrying a knife just like carrying a gun is dangerous and wrong
5356894 but government and the police cant solve this problem by themselves we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models

5356915 were doing 70km h there in the team pursuit theres not many people who are going to go faster than that in the madison
5356916 we want to take this realistic approach to enlarge the genre because its much more universal weve been shifting from classic survival horror from back in 2001 with alone in the dark the new nightmare and we started to introduce disaster aspect with cold fear now we are moving to a more realistic approach to survival and thats what we want to renew and bring with this new game
5356917 we pray the miners know deep in their hearts our gratitude for all their hard work
5356918 i only pretend i want to forget the years i spent down the pit
5356919 i think this is fantastic as long as the wheel is here people will know there was a colliery on this site and how important the industry was to keresley
5356920 this is a fitting memorial to the few men who died or were seriously injured working down the mine
5356921 the colliery was a huge part of the local community when we first came here the club over the road was always full of people enjoying themselves and 99 per cent of them were miners

5356927 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5356928 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5356929 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5356930 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5356931 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5356932 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5356933 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5356934 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5356935 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5356936 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5356937 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5356938 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5356939 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5356940 we had a hearing in the supreme court today but we ran out of time
5356941 we need at least three more hearings before the court can reach a verdict
5356942 simon and dannii have both had more work done since last year i m the only judge who s had nothing done not even my teeth they are still my own
5356943 louis should be looking in the mirror and realising what he needs doing i ve actually offered to pay for his teeth one at a time
5356944 it s really hard to believe she s 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
5356945 i m sure she s happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
5356946 it was strange i couldnt plan anything in my life i just had to wait
5356947 we cant take any more people than is our capacity
5356948 the only answer is to come up with a common solution to bosnias problems why should we spend the money to build a new expensive system when we already have a working one just across the dividing line
5356949 it is dangerous but we cant do anything about it said ferid niksic the assistant to the warden
5356950 but its not as though if you just put away the 200 people the situation on the streets would be ideal without crime
5356951 they ordered me to pay 1 000 bosnian marka 500 euros but i couldnt afford to pay
5356952 i wouldnt want to escape because i was not guilty
5356953 i waited five or six months to start my sentence but that was good because i had time to finish up some work before coming in
5356954 there are conflicts but they happen on an individual basis rather than because of national identity
5356955 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5356956 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5356957 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5356958 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5356959 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5356960 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia
5356961 there is one thing we do on earth that we will continue to do in heaven that is to praise and worship god that is why we view life on earth for those who live jesus as choir practise for heaven to say that praise and worship is the most important category of music is an understatement in light of that fact there is no more important activity of the human heart that to praise and worship god

5356963 the cold war is over the soviet empire is gone and neither one is missed
5356964 least of all is that empire missed by the once captive nations of estonia latvia lithuania poland ukraine and georgia
5356965 these brave young nations have joined the free world and they are not going back
5356966 should be able to count on the free world for support and solidarity
5356967 if i am elected president they will have that support
5356968 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5356969 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5356970 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
5356971 tornadoes are likely in some areas tonight monday and tomorrow and maybe even into the next few days
5356972 dont you start because then ill start and youll make that face and ill make that snorting noise and then well both be in trouble and i didnt even start it
5356973 i will give up this bad habit and endeavour to contract this good one
5356974 we shall try to improve it in this respect or the other where excess or defect is evident we must try at the same time to embrace so much in our view that we may avoid in putting one thing right putting something else wrong
5356975 you dont need a tin opener to peel a banana

5356978 it is not good for the man to be alone
5356979 two are better than one because they have a good return for their work if one falls down his friend can help him up but pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up
5356980 a person first starts to live when he can live outside of himself
5356981 no man can live happily who regards himself alone who turns everything to his own advantage you must live for others if you wish to live for yourself

5356983 first we are pleased to have filed the quarterly report for green globe international and to maintain its compliance with required financial reporting timelines
5356984 second the assumption of debt reflected in this quarterly report was the primary cost for the companys acquisition of the green globe brand
5356985 while there is no value attributed directly to ownership of the green globe brand in the current financial statements the company is now in the position to derive substantial revenues from its very timely purchase of the most highly recognized and only internationally established green brand
5356986 the next quarterly report filed by green globe international will include the first revenues generated since the company acquired the green globe brand while expect that this is only the beginning realizing revenues is an important first step in developing value for the companys shareholders

5356991 in schools we teachers are always told to think what the learning outcomes are for various activities in school
5356992 what are the learning outcomes expected from fingerprinting our children
5356993 i am appalled to read that biometric fingerprinting is being introduced into new build schools in east dunbartonshire and that this infringement on personal liberty has already been introduced in lenzie academy and boclair academy without as far as i know any public consultation or any debate in the council chambers it is absurd to say that pupils can opt out of fingerprintin how can the average 11 year old know the implications of such a move why have parents not been directly involved in this sinister development nor is it sufficient to say that safeguards are in place to protect the use of the data so obtained a glance at our westminster governments ability to lose extensive personal records shows how well protected databases are in practice it is a relief to know that at least one msp has written to education secretary fiona hyslop for an explanation but i would be more reasured if protests had been heard from our councillors and from our mainstream political parties i would think it important that all such biometric fingerprinting records should be destroyed prior to a public debate on the necessity desirability and safety of such intrusive record keeping taking place

5357005 i was confident today because my bike was fast from friday practice and with jeremy we made a small modification to the front after warm up to allow me to be a bit faster in some sections and it worked very well i lost about half a second getting past hopkins at the start and casey was incredibly fast at that stage like hed already done ten laps for a short time i was worried but then after two laps i understood that my bike was working very well and that i was fast enough to try to catch him i had closed a little bit already and gradually the red bike was becoming a bit bigger in front of me and i think this is when he started to push harder and made his mistake i was anticipating a very hard battle if i did catch him so when i saw the red bike slide out i could hardly believe it this made things a lot easier for me after that i just enjoyed riding my bike my bridgestone tires worked very well until the end and my m1 felt very good of course i cant count this as a complete victory because casey fell and i am sorry for him but this is racing and i have to be happy with this result we are 50 points clear which is a lot and i am very excited to be going to misano in this situation however we know that 50 points is still not always enough when you have someone as strong as casey and so we wont relax now we have two days of testing and we will try some new electronics in order to help me open the throttle earlier and also of course test some bridgestone tires
5357006 obviously we are all disappointed with this result because our pace in practice was good everything went very well this morning and we felt we could push out in front things were going according to plan until the crash i was doing the same lap time over and over and i was quite happy with the pace i was running the crash came out of the blue that corner was an easy one but i lost the front and it happened very quickly very suddenly and i didnt manage to save it its a hard one to explain and we will look at the data but sometimes this kind of crash happens at this level of racing and it was my mistake we knew that we needed to win this race and more in order to close down valentinos advantage so this makes the championship very difficult for us anything can happen in racing but fifty points is a big gap against such a strong and consistent competitor anyway i never throw in the towel nor does anybody at ducati and we will keep fighting until the end misano is a home race for the factory and there will be lots of ducatisti there so my main thought now is to stay positive and bounce back with a good show for them in two weeks time
5357007 now that i work at home i worry that you have forgotten about me bet youll remember me now
5357008 all this time we thought car emmissions were ruining the planet

5357014 relentless exhausting pressure to hit numbers knowing youll be fired and likely ruined if theyre missed resorting to accounting shenanigans to make ends meet feeling trapped by blackball threats
5357015 more hours in the day required to accomplish more tasks and more blame when profits fail to meet expectations or just fail altogether

5357075 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more
5357076 miss jolie says she likes john mccain too and hasnt decided who to endorse huh arent you supposed to be somewhat enlightened or do you not know that the african daughter you hold in every picture had parents who suffered and died because of the republican partys worldwide economic assault on africa over the last few decades since reagan

5357096 after the olympics expect chinas leadership to undergo a thorough housecleaning to resolve many of the problems that have accumulated in the past decade steps taken to maintain social stability such as holding down energy commodity and food prices will likely expire at the same time the chinese financial system is likely to be the target of reforms resulting in the recognition of many troubled or bad loans and the replacement of staff at the institutions that made them in this shuffle it is likely that the policy of rmb appreciation will be revisited and perhaps the rmb will be permitted to either stabilize or decline to help hard pressed export industries

5357106 saya begitu yakin sebab motorku cepat saat sesi latihan bebas hari jumat dan jeremy burgess membuat modifikasi kecil di bagian depan saat sesi latihan pemanasan berlangsung yang membuatku sedikit lebih cepat di beberapa bagian dan itu bekerja dengan sangat baik
5357107 saya kehilangan sekitar setengah detik untuk dapat melewati hopkins ketika lomba dimulai dan saat itu casey sangat cepat seperti dia telah menjalani 10 laps
5357108 untuk beberapa saat saya khawatir tapi kemudian setelah dua lap saya tahu bahwa motorku bekerja dengan begitu baik dan itu cukup untuk dapat mengejarnya
5357109 saya telah mengantisipasi pertarungan yang ketat jika saya dapat menangkapnya jadi ketika saya melihat motor merah itu tergelincir keluar saya tidak dapat mempercayainya ini membuatku lebih mudah
5357110 setelahnya stoner terjatuh saya hanya menikmati motorku saja ban bridgestone bekerja dengan sangat baik hingga akhir dan m1 terasa sangat bagus tentu saja saya tidak dapat menghitungnya sebagai kemenangan yang sempurna sebab stoner terjatuh malang bagi dia tapi inilah balapan dan saya juga harus senang dengan hasil ini
5357111 kami unggul 50 poin dan itu banyak dan saya sangat bergairah untuk ke misano dengan situasi seperti ini
5357112 bagaimanapun juga kita tahu bahwa 50 poin belumlah cukup ketika anda mempunyai lawan seperti casey jadi kami tidak akan bersantai santai
5357113 jelas sudah bahwa valentino telah melakukan pekerjaan yang baik dari mulai lomba dengan tidak membiarkan stoner terlalu jauh didepan dan dia sekarang menyusun pijakan dan menaruh sedikit beban dengannya ketika dia terjatuh
5357114 kita perlu mempertahankan keadaan ini dan tidak lepas konsentrasi tapi kami telah mendapatkan dua balapan yang sangat bagus dan kami yakin bahwa kami sedang dalam kondisi yang bagus
5357115 kami akan mencoba beberapa elektronik baru guna membantuku dapat membuka throttle lebih awal dan juga pastinya menguji beberapa ban bridgestone baru

5357174 we dont take organs from the near dead to save other lives
5357175 they went through extraordinary measures to resuscitate him and they did resuscitate him after 19 minutes
5357176 there was never any hope he could sustain his life on his own
5357177 we felt unequivocally that the donors were dead before we removed their hearts
5357178 they said cardiac function was irreversibly lost and then reversed it
5357179 when our pager beeped the first time we ever heard it our hearts stopped
5357180 we have to realize that it isnt just antivirals that we need
5357181 we need to make sure that were prepared to treat people with antibiotics
5357182 our track record is a reflection of the strong support of college leaders as well as faculty and local physicians
5357183 students know that when they come to uic they will receive an excellent education and dedicated support
5357184 there was less blood loss with this procedure than with conventional surgery and there is the potential for a faster recovery
5357185 the results were outstanding and suggest the robot assisted surgery is an attractive option for fistulas that would normally require abdominal surgery

5357187 cerebral malaria is lethal 20 percent of the time in the best of hands and here weve shown that something as simple as aspirin because of its affect on platelets might be able to improve the outcomes of those who contract this deadly form of the disease
5357188 the take home lesson is that platelets by releasing pf4 are playing an early role in the wind up phase of cerebral malaria
5357189 our mouse studies show that timing is critical with the mice we know when we infected them and controlled when we treated them a big challenge in translating this to humans is that people dont know when they get infected
5357190 platelets dont get any respect but theyre the second most abundant cell in the blood after red blood cells and packed full of factors that rally the immune system to action by taking what we know about platelets and their activation and applying it to malaria we have found a driver of cerebral malaria
5357191 we are very fortunate to have someone of dr wispes caliber join our neonatology program
5357192 the patients we treat and our program will directly benefit from the expertise and experience dr wispe brings to the team
5357193 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5357194 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5357195 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5357196 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5357197 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children
5357198 despite the results the boys have played hard all season and under difficult circumstances have stuck together never quit and have laid the foundations for future bulldogs
5357199 im especially proud of how hard they have finished and they can be proud of their season

5357201 it is great fun for all involved and is the perfect way for us to give something back to the local community it could even help produce the next frank lampard
5357202 but it is not uncommon in this sport to compete with three members
5357203 when you dont bring that intensity to the table you probably dont have the quality at bats you want and we just didnt score enough runs plain and simple
5357204 we had opportunities against b c saturday when we had the bases loaded and we didnt score
5357205 coming here i thought we had a team that swung the bat pretty good but when you look at our total run production obviously theres room for improvement
5357206 the very fact that we didnt have any exhibition games against teams of this calibre would have hurt us but the boys would have then had to realize they had to bring to the table their
5357207 when we went to select this team we had 24 kids try out and that was it and we finished fourth in the nation
5357208 of the four losses we had here we lost to the gold medal winning team the silver and the bronze medal team these guys have nothing to hang their heads about at all it just goes to show you the talent level of this team and the talent level in moose jaw were fostering some good ballplayers here
5357209 we had a 3 1 lead and had a couple of errors cost us five runs in one of the innings
5357210 we managed to battle back and just didnt have enough to get through
5357211 lanaudi re got a couple of hits early on pitcher jimmy dombowsky and it just was too much to come back from
5357212 in the bottom of the seventh we had the tying run at the plate and we just couldnt manage to get him across
5357213 we consistently all year had good pitching good hitting and good defence
5357214 from my perspective its been an absolute pleasure to have coached these guys theyre an incredible team and incredible ballplayers
5357215 you can really see them coming together as a team and facing adversity sunday
5357216 they never quit at all they were all standing in the seventh inning of each game thinking weve still got a chance they werent going to let it die
5357217 i thought all the guys competed hard and things went pretty good
5357218 we were pretty happy with all the guys that we made commitments to and i thought all the 1994s showed well
5357219 it was a good weekend and there are going to be some tough decisions

5357251 one of the things we did in the creation of the school was to come at it from an interdisciplinary approach
5357252 doesnt just pay lip service to interdisciplinary education they live it they do it
5357253 they didnt just e mail me back with yes or no responses to my questions
5357254 i felt we were practically applying our thoughts and research to difficult problems it was the creative aspect that stood out for me
5357255 now when i send r sum s to places like that im taken fairly seriously

5357259 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5357260 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama

5357269 making a sequel to a game is always tougher especially given the arms race were seeing in videogames development
5357270 games do not compete in fun experiences they compete in the number of weapons and unfortunately its easy for someone to compare this game to that game this game has 10 multiplayer levels but this one has 29 so clearly this game must be better
5357271 if you can imagine if movies competed in this way well sure schindlers list was good but i know this three and a half hour long movie think of the value youre getting for your ten dollars it doesnt work that way and unfortunately we still find ourselves competing this way we have to compete in quality not size
5357272 as much as we dont want to play the game call of duty has this many guns and this has this many guns and how many will you have you cant escape that comparison when you do a sequel everyone expects more from a sequel you have to
5357273 were not scared to death that were not going to make a game that is really really better than gears of war 1 i know its prettier i know its faster i know its more fun i know its likely to be longer and still im worried that were not going to get the review scores that we did for the first one because everyone has these increased expectations at least we decided we werent going to compete in size with ourselves well compete with other really new experiences
5357274 unfortunately this was the thing we were shouting from the rooftops so we didnt listen to ourselves saying we were taking our last game and going to make it bigger and better we set ourselves up for quite a challenge of course we succeeded

5357276 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5357277 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5357278 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5357279 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5357280 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5357281 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5357282 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5357283 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5357284 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5357285 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
5357286 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5357287 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5357288 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5357289 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5357290 but like my dad said at the end of the day i have the most important medal
5357291 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5357292 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5357293 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5357294 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5357295 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5357296 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5357297 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5357298 who are open to doing something on the production side
5357299 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5357300 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5357301 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5357302 but ill take it its important when you start a five match series that you start well
5357303 it was not easy with the new ball but we managed to get through which is the most important thing
5357304 weve got another four more games to play we need to make sure that we concentrate
5357305 they have got a lot of talented individual players who can change the match for them
5357306 we misread the wicket a bit we thought it may not seam or swing that much
5357307 it gets really tough in a one day game when you lose too many wickets upfront
5357308 by the time you realize what ball it is it gets really late to play a big shot
5357309 its not only about going through the motions right here just playing through mendis you have to score the runs thats also important
5357310 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5357311 i just didnt want to have to go through the pain so i just did everything i could to have the best restart i could and it worked out great
5357312 were gearing up for the chase im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships thats what were shooting for
5357313 the greatest part is we didnt give up more bonus points to kyle
5357314 hes just so strong every time i win and he finishes second thats really a 20 point spread for us thats what we have to keep doing is to try and win the next three events and go into this chase on even ground
5357315 he has been all year yeah its a 20 point swing weve got to live with it hopefully we can make it up someplace else
5357316 my guys did an unbelievable job getting me off pit road
5357317 what were doing here is a little bit of practicing for the chase and trying to get those 10 points to catch that 18 car carl edwards did a great job the pit crew did a great job
5357318 it just came down to when he beat us off of pit road
5357319 that was it for us we just didnt quite have the car capable enough of being able to beat those guys we were good on that one run that one set of tires but that was pretty much what we had
5357320 obviously my swing was there this week and my putter but there wasnt really a tee shot i didnt like
5357321 not getting it up and down on 11 kind of ticked me off
5357322 i kind of told myself im letting the tournament get away from me again that was where the tournament was won for me
5357323 i kind of felt like i let the tournament slip away on 10 and 11
5357324 i told myself on the next tee box i got my momentum
5357325 finally feel like you got one back on that hole
5357326 it will be a great satisfaction just to think about you know pulled it off and did it and its a wonderful feeling
5357327 doesnt happen that often in golf unless youre tiger woods
5357328 second place is obviously tough to swallow right now but ill probably be pretty happy here when i realize ive got a job for the rest of the year
5357329 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5357330 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
5357331 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5357332 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5357333 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5357334 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

5357337 it only takes a few seconds for a child to drown and small children can drown in just a few inches of water in a bathtub a toilet or a bucket
5357338 as for the second half of this year its going to be very tough and only the fittest carriers will survive this onslaught
5357339 we managed to reduce non fuel expenditure by 13 per cent although it was not enough to mitigate the fuel increase of 56 per cent
5357340 we spent an additional rm808 million in fuel as the price increased from us 85 rm284 per barrel to us 150 rm501 per barrel but we used gains from our hedging and forex foreign exchange amounting to rm185 million to mitigate the fuel increase
5357341 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
5357342 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5357343 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5357344 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5357345 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5357346 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5357347 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5357348 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
5357349 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5357350 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5357351 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5357352 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5357353 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5357354 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5357355 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5357356 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5357357 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5357358 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5357359 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5357360 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
5357361 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
5357362 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
5357363 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5357364 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5357365 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5357366 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5357367 the world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page
5357368 we have a specific length of time to speculate what we are going to do
5357369 lee county eocs best estimation is determining that this storm will probably follow the coast and go up the northeast corner of the storm will be the worst and we may be impacted by that
5357370 the tide for that day will be three feet above normal anyway due to full moon and an optimal tide
5357371 that will be around 2 p m on tuesday combined with the three to five feet of water from the storm if we have a surge that will be our major problem right there
5357372 a great concern that the lee county eoc has right now is tornadoes
5357373 if our equipment is damaged if saltwater gets into them its of no use to anyone
5357374 the causeway on the island cole island for example is four feet above sea level
5357375 if we go to five feet of tide you wont be getting off the island unless you have a boat
5357376 yo no s realmente lo que est pasando ahora la industria discogr fica esta en una posici n muy pol tica en este momento y yo estoy en emi records en donde muchas personas han sido despedidas

5357378 bees and other stinging insects are a particular warm weather concern for persons who may be at risk for anaphylaxis from insect stings
5357379 thats why its especially important for persons who have had past reactions to insects to avoid getting stung because even if an initial reaction was mild subsequent ones can become life threatening
5357380 in addition persons with a personal or family history of allergic conditions such as asthma hay fever or eczema may be more susceptible to anaphylaxis and persons with asthma and food allergies combined are more at risk for having an anaphylactic reaction to certain foods than are persons who have food allergies but not asthma
5357381 by going for a jog in the park for example within a few hours after eating it
5357382 so its important for persons who have ever had such a reaction to avoid eating trigger foods especially several hours prior to exercising

5357384 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5357385 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5357386 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5357387 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5357388 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5357389 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5357390 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5357391 six out of 10 lifeboat launches are thanks to legacies similar to the one mr fox made
5357392 the work of our lifeboat crews relies entirely upon the generosity of kind supporters
5357393 legacy gifts are a vital source of income to the rnli and we are grateful for any donations
5357394 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5357395 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5357396 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5357397 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5357398 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5357399 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5357400 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5357401 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5357402 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5357403 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5357404 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5357405 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5357406 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5357407 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5357408 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5357409 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5357410 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5357411 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5357412 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5357413 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

5357432 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5357433 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer
5357434 creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned
5357435 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5357436 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5357437 justice oconnor showed her liberal colors declaring the word jesus as illegal religious speech which can be banned by any council who wishes to ignore the first amendment as she did
5357438 by ruling that prayer is government speech oconnor has established a government favored version of god
5357439 the restriction that prayers be nonsectarian in nature is designed to make the prayers accessible to people who come from a variety of backgrounds not to exclude or disparage a particular faith
5357440 this type of policy has been advocated by the alliance defense fund and has been adopted nationwide by a number of local and state governments
5357441 so long as prayers at public meetings are offered by private citizens not government officials and are not intended to proselytize or to disparage another religion governmental bodies are allowed to have sectarian prayers before their meetings
5357442 when legislatures or private groups censor prayers in jesus name pastors and other christians who believe their prayers should be offered in jesus name are treated like second class citizens and are prohibited from participating in this important american tradition
5357443 it seems to us that this is exactly the sort of government intrusion into religion that the first amendment seeks to avoid

5357454 im pro choice on gassing jews and i believe in the final solution
5357455 i believe everybody who wants to buy slaves ought to be able to because i dont think those choices are made casually after all slaves cost money so ill protect the right of every american to own as many africans as he can afford but we ought to look at ways to encourage and support americans who dont want to own slaves so we dont have any more black slaves on plantations than strictly necessary
5357456 i support the right of the german people to gas as many jews as they want but we also ought to look at ways of encouraging those germans who dont want to gas jews so the holocaust will be as small as possible

5357470 no wonder they want to make the election about me
5357471 they dont want to be talking about their record because they cant defend it
5357472 hes giving 300 billion tax breaks to corporations including oil companies like exxon mobil that have made record profits every quarter for the past three quarters
5357473 john mccain and i both have a tax plan but i benefit the middle class and working families and he is benefiting the same corporations that have been making out like bandits under the bush administration
5357474 and we can use that to generate energy and free ourselves from dependence on foreign oil

5357479 i thought he was a really good speaker in person
5357480 he addressed the issues and he made it plain that our interests are his interests
5357481 to me hes not a celebrity hes a man of substance
5357482 i think hes nice and i think hes sincere in what he says

5357530 so as you may have heard we are being sued by our former record company for the ridiculously oversized totally unrealistic and pretty silly but slightly clever sum of 30 000 000 insane yea thats what we said too
5357531 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5357532 yes we have been sued by emi but not for failing to deliver music or for quitting we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here wed rather not air any dirty laundry but basically our representatives could not get emi to agree to make a fair and reasonable deal
5357533 emis relationship with 30stm has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of three million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fan base
5357534 however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success

5357551 we are reviewing our shareholding in virgin nigeria at the moment we are in discussions with potential purchasers those talks are ongoing and have been in progress for several weeks
5357552 weve always said since it launched that its important that virgin nigeria goes its own way and is wholly owned by nigerian investors now its been just over three years so its appropriate to have those talks now weve helped it to become a safe and reliable flag carrier for the region
5357553 it is appropriate to consider whether the virgin brand should remain linked to virgin nigeria removing the virgin branding is a possible future option
5357554 theres no doubt that lots of recent events have helped our view
5357555 as far as virgin is concerned we signed a detailed contract in 2004 providing all the necessary documents a deal is a deal so virgin nigeria should be allowed to operate domestic flights out of the international terminal

5357578 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5357579 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential for britains security never mind the personal ties that bind nearly one million british people to pakistan that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thorough going reform of its social political and economic structures
5357580 the uk will remain strongly committed to its partnership with the pakistani people notably through our aid programme we will also continue to deepen our security co operation with the new government

5357582 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5357583 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5357584 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5357585 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate

5357607 an armed group consisting of georgian and ukrainian nationalists and georgia based chechen terrorists is being urgently formed on the outskirts of gori they plan to make their way to gori and wear russian military informs to pillage and torment the local population
5357608 russian peacemakers remain on their positions none of them has entered gori we officially proclaim that the georgian authorities will be wholly responsibly for the provocation in case it becomes impossible to avoid it
5357609 they were seen wearing the uniform of the russian army and wielding russian weapons several people carrying photo and video equipment were seen with them too
5357610 what the georgian authorities have done is beyond human understanding it cannot be justified or allowed to go unpunished
5357611 we will see to it that this crime does not go unpunished
5357612 our armed forces have overcome the crisis of the 1990s are battle worthy and can perform any peacekeeping mission
5357613 this work is being obstructed by the u s and britain which are trying to distort the content of a peace plan a posteriori and present the situation as if the aggressive act committed by georgia against south ossetia on august 8 did not affect the situation in the region and which are ignoring the acute need to consider the status of south ossetia and abkhazia
5357614 apple inc s iphone 3g was just a couple of days old when reports began trickling onto the companys support forum from dissatisfied customers regarding iphones 3g reception
5357615 whats going on we may not have all the answers but we do have questions heres our take on the griping about iphone 3g reception
5357616 its conceivable that apple has diagnosed the reception and dropped call bugs and that it can produce a fix soon but its also possible that an update is weeks or months away thats apple you never know since the company wont discuss much of anything certainly not details of updates before theyre released
5357617 the only definitive date on apples iphone calendar is aug 22 this coming friday when the company will unveil the iphone 3g in another 20 plus markets apple has a history of doing software updates when it launches a new version of hardware so its possible that the aug 22 debut in new countries will coincide with a firmware fix

5357653 the u s military is paying scientists to study ways to read peoples thoughts
5357654 the hope is that the research could someday lead to a gadget capable of translating the thoughts of soldiers who suffered brain injuries in combat or even stroke patients in hospitals
5357655 they were given 58 words and asked to think about the meaning and properties of the words brain scans taken when the users were thinking about the different words were then captured using magnetic resonance imaging which identifies real time brain activity

5357685 there are problems in chinas future but the opportunities we have now are good
5357686 today my apartment would cost about 900 000 yuan about 133 000 u s
5357687 my same apartment downtown would cost 3 million yuan 444 000 u s i feel lucky to own a home
5357688 gas is expensive almost the same as in the u s and there is very little public parking in beijing we take taxi or subway both cheap by big city standards and save money
5357689 this is a big chance for china to show the world that we are modern
5357690 i worry that families become lazy and eat out because its easy and quick
5357691 we have to be careful not to become a lazy society
5357692 chairman putney chairman colgan chairman purkey and members of the general assembly good morning
5357693 each year i come before you to present an end of year report on the commonwealths economic and fiscal performance
5357694 as you all know our nation is struggling with a significant economic downturn
5357695 when i appeared before you last year we were beginning to see slower rates of growth in jobs and income and moderate growth in the overall economy
5357696 in february we announced that our reforecast indicated further economic slowing creating a need to reduce by 1
5357697 now six months later the national economy is continuing to slow which will necessitate a reforecast this fall and the likely need for more budget cuts
5357698 the task that lies before us will not be easy
5357699 i would like to start by reviewing the underlying conditions in our national economic picture and the commonwealths financial performance in the just completed fiscal year
5357700 as anyone reading newspaper headlines knows the effects of the ongoing housing downturn and turmoil in financial markets continue to be a drag on economic growth
5357701 american families and businesses are struggling with increased energy costs
5357702 partly due to these energy and credit issues employers clamped down on hiring in july
5357703 in virginia the revenue forecast for fiscal year 2008 was the second most accurate estimate in the last twenty five years
5357704 however the national economic factors continue to affect revenue collections at the state level the housing market in virginia continues to drift downward with notable declines in sales prices statewide
5357705 as we look ahead into the likely revenues for the current biennial budget there are some troubling trends
5357706 sales tax collections which would now have to grow at 4
5357707 the weaker than normal performance in income and sales tax collections at the end of the 2008 fiscal year suggest the need for a reforecasting process to begin sooner than the traditional november and december timeframe
5357708 in the past the primary focus of any revenue re forecast has been on general fund revenue sources
5357709 in the midst of a difficult time virginians are purchasing fewer vehicles and shifting toward less expensive models
5357710 the federal transportation revenues relied on by virginia and other states are very much in doubt at this point
5357711 because of these real concerns about general and non general fund revenue sources i believe it would not be wise to wait until november to conduct the normal reforecasting of state revenues
5357712 secretary brown will confer with industry leaders in key sectors over the coming weeks to discuss their assessment of future prospects in their respective areas
5357713 despite news reports speculating about the magnitude of the revenue slowdown it would not be wise to engage in guesswork at this point
5357714 the obvious question given the need for a reforecast is what steps will be taken after we have new numbers in place while the steps we take will obviously depend upon the magnitude of any downward revenue adjustment our recent history gives us the basic template for future action
5357715 in the last 12 months we have dealt with revenue reductions that total nearly 2 billion over the three fiscal year period of 2008 2009 and 2010 in making these reductions we have followed a few basic principles
5357716 first we have made our cuts on the basis of performance the virginia performs data platform and the dpb performance budgeting system give us the ability to scrutinize how each program affects our citizens we can then make decisions that reflect the best prioritization of state services
5357717 second we have made our decisions in an open and transparent way as we make cuts we deliver to the general assembly full information about where the reductions will be made as well as information about reduction ideas that we have considered but chosen not to pursue
5357718 third as we have lowered revenue estimates we have tried to adjust base budget expenses downward using sustainable long term strategies to find savings
5357719 finally we have made no recommendations for increases to general fund revenue sources
5357720 as we go into a next round of cuts it is clear that the choices will be more difficult
5357721 for example in the past rounds of reduction nearly two thirds of the general fund programs were not subjected to significant levels of budget reductions
5357722 the need to engage in a third major round of budget reductions will mean by necessity that all programs including those previously held harmless and all available strategies will be on the table for review
5357723 when you have to go to the depths we did from a physical and a mental point of view and to come out on the positive side it is certainly going to hasten the development of your players
5357724 they know they can go to the well and keep going to well and thats important
5357725 but perhaps because of pressure from us or perhaps because of the anxiety of where the scoreboard was they didnt take them
5357726 we managed to take ours and i think we finished the game reasonably on top
5357727 this is a new team with a lot of new players in it and its very young in its infancy
5357728 weve been under a lot of pressure as a group and weve responded i think magnificently weve had two really top games now after a lot of people were writing us off when a side can get up and do that its always satisfying
5357729 everyone has a chance and it makes for an exciting tri nations
5357730 the bledisloe cup will be up for grabs and so will the tri nations so theres plenty to play for
5357731 theyd often pop their heads over the fence and ask about bringing their dogs into the beer garden while they have a drink monday nights were quiet for us so we thought why not
5357732 dogs have preferences just as we do regardless owners buy the food
5357733 birthday cakes are popular over summer given the number of pet parties in the park doggy day care centres buy quite a few too
5357734 too much food leads to obesity and other medical problems
5357735 all social animals need a kind and consistent rule structure if this is not provided and boundaries change this can increase anxiety
5357736 owners can select what they want according to preference and budget then i make up party packs to share with their pooch pals in the park
5357737 no matter what they did there was no way to help liu no way to keep him standing up
5357738 only immediate friends could understand our feelings at this moment
5357739 his psychology is also great he can withstand the pressure that no other athletes can withstand he will not withdraw unless the pain is intolerable unless he has no other way out
5357740 we are thrilled to welcome dr ruperto to the crossroads organization to provide medical oversight utilization and management reviews of our publicly funded mental health services for the citizens of iredell surry and yadkin counties
5357741 dr rupertos interest in community mental health will be a strong asset as crossroads continues to develop programs and strengthen provider network systems to meet the increasing demands for behavioral healthcare in our three county area

5357787 most of us girls we have to stop our sport so we can start a family but for her to have a family and still get back in and win the silver medal is just absolutely incredible
5357788 3 friends and their schemes to get on stay on and survive the red carpet
5357789 the writing that underscores walking the red s derivative plot and characters is cliched and unpolished grammatical errors appear occasionally zemeckis obsessive cataloguing of the designer clothes her characters wear and the expensive things they own quickly grows exhausting as do her attempts at name dropping
5357790 additionally the author doesnt really have the vocabulary she needs to write a frothy book like this
5357791 natalie sat on her six foot long magenta sofa surrounded by the latest issues of
5357792 if all the papers call me a trust fund baby
5357793 i think people watch it mostly to figure out why theyre watching it
5357794 pop culture writing made to sound just as erudite as actual culture writing but able to sell lots more magazines and make everyone a lot more popular at parties
5357795 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5357796 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed
5357797 so the first question you might ask your surgeon is how many of these surgeries have you done and the second question is are you a gamer
5357798 creating an environment in which informal scientific reasoning practices are being learned
5357799 i just started this sport for fun and it wasnt even an olympic sport and then it got into the olympics i went to three games and now i have a third medal
5357800 i remember back in the early 70s when i had a disastrous grand prix my wife lynn said to me dont worry youre going to be a late boomer
5357801 and so the olympics dont go well and id say lynn said im a late bloomer ill go to the next one and sure enough guess what happened i bloomed
5357802 not making it out of the heats thats just ridiculous
5357803 i wouldnt have cared if i finished last with a broken arm but i needed another arm to climb those hills today

5357809 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5357810 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5357811 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5357812 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5357813 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5357814 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5357815 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5357816 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known
5357817 builders are anticipating the stimulative effects of this legislation and are optimistic that the tax credit will give those buyers whove been sitting on the fence the reason they need to jump back into the market

5357822 set minimum prices on their products and force retailers to refrain from discounting
5357823 now require them to abide by minimum pricing pacts or risk having their supplies cut off
5357824 estimated that legalizing price setting could add 300 billion to annual consumer costs
5357825 could foster competition by giving retailers enough profit to promote a brand or offer better service

5357839 are you as cool in person as you are on myspace
5357840 we must always be concerned when an administration seeks to rewrite the rules months before they leave office
5357841 i wrote the endangered species act and seeing it signed into law was among my proudest moments as a member of congress the changes sought by the bush administration would seriously weaken the law eliminating the requirement that scientists be the ones making decisions regarding science instead giving political hacks and unsympathetic bureaucrats another opportunity to attack the scientific community it is remarkable that this bill signed into law by richard m nixon and accepted for decades as a pillar of american conservation would be destroyed by george w bush in the final months of his administration it is most peculiar that a statute which has done so much good should be now jeopardized by the stroke of a hostile presidential pen
5357842 i am certain that such a scenario is not possible in ukraine
5357843 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighboring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
5357844 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilization scenario in crimea
5357845 i have therefore sent an urgent proposal to the president of russia to start talks on signing an agreement that would regulate our relations in the event of military action like that which we saw at the beginning of august
5357846 in other words we need to come up with clearer rules that would ensure ukraine s national security in such situations
5357847 i am certain that such a scenario is not possible in ukraine
5357848 prosperity peace and calm in crimea is the very foundation on which the interests of ukraine and neighboring russia coincide everything else is of secondary importance
5357849 if we complete this stage and go on to the next one we can be confident that there will be no russian or any other destabilization scenario in crimea
5357850 i have therefore sent an urgent proposal to the president of russia to start talks on signing an agreement that would regulate our relations in the event of military action like that which we saw at the beginning of august
5357851 in other words we need to come up with clearer rules that would ensure ukraine s national security in such situations
5357852 s au asezat pe valea neajlovului sa inopteze au mancat si au dus tuciurile de mamaliga in albia raului sa stea in apa toata noapte pentru a putea fi mai usor curatate dimineata in zori cand au scos tuciurile acestea erau pline de peste atunci starostele a zis ca acolo trebuie sa ramana si au hotarat sa aseze vatra satului de a lungul apei
5357853 cand eram copil si eram la sapa veneam sa beau apa de la buduroi apa izvora din deal si dupa zece metri se varsa in rau era o binecuvantare sa ai apa proaspata in mijlocul campului la atatia kilometri de sat mai faceam si baie chiar daca ne era cam frica de lipitori de altfel chiar pe drumul din apropierea izvorului m am nascut era mai vremea prasilei dintai mai erau cativa ani pana sa inceapa razboiul

5357856 this budget is being balanced on the backs of the states working people
5357857 an alternative would be to tax the rich and those who can best afford it like the steinbrenners and ratners who are given huge tax breaks that could bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars why does yankee stadium warrant more consideration than the working and middle class people of this state
5357858 as i said last month my goal is to reduce spending in the 2008 09 budget by at least an additional 600 million today i have provided the legislature with over 1 billion in current year savings options as we begin a productive dialogue and work together toward the goal of ensuring the states fiscal integrity
5357859 why do we need to target the poor black and hispanic communities instead of the special interest groups that have lots of money
5357860 as usual no one wants to go after special interest groups to solve these problems the easiest targets to no ones surprise nor concern are funding cuts for medicaid higher education and social services that will have a disproportionate effect on the lives of poor and less fortunate new yorkers
5357861 it is absurd to cut 51 million from cuny and 506 million from medicaid
5357862 come on david we need to tax the rich dont punish the poor
5357863 if we do a millionaires tax we dont have to hurt the poor and working class who are already struggling to make ends meet we could put a 2 5 percent increase on those who make 500 000 a 3 5 percent increase on those who make a million dollars a 5 percent increase on those who make 5 million and a 7 percent increase on those who make 10 million that constitutes 97 000 people which is only 2 5 percent of the population and that will generate 6 5 billion dollars and you dont have to cut anything
5357864 how can you cut health care spending by reducing the monies you give to medicaid thats money provided to hospitals to help struggling working class families why would you cut medicaid and monies for education when you can tax the rich
5357865 on april 1 2009 in just 232 days we will have no other choice but to reduce spending and close a 6 4 billion budget gap and if the economy continues to worsen the spending reductions i have proposed will be necessary to help ensure the current years budget remains in balance either way the longer we fail to act the more painful and limited our choices will be
5357866 just like families across new york facing difficult economic times our state government needs to scrutinize its spending carefully and acknowledge that we simply cannot afford everything we want or everything we counted on when we thought we had more money
5357867 my two cents in helping the governor solve new york states fiscal crisis
5357868 serious fiscal hallenges with our states next budget and has some difficult decisions to make regarding this enormous projected deficit
5357869 if the governor really wants to balance the budget and find some money to fill the gaps diaz announced
5357870 according to the working families party if the governor were to propose a tax surcharge on wealthy new yorkers who make in excess of 10 000 or more per week and eliminate corporate loopholes the state can generate 6 to 7 billion dollars in new tax revenue per year this will pay for middle class and working class tax relief and keep our transit school and health systems in decent repair
5357871 presently when people in new york make purchases with credit cards the credit card companies send the taxes collected and owed to the state back to the merchants instead of sending the money directly to the state why cant the governor force credit card companies to send this money already collected directly to new york state instead of to the merchants
5357872 many food pantries across new york state wisely purchase food at bulk rate saving millions of dollars why cant the governor propose bulk rate medication purchases for institutions instead of catering to the pharmaceutical companies
5357873 baby it reminds me of a maggot or some kind of disgusting parasite
5357874 i dont hate babies i just kind of feel better when theyre not around
5357875 oh god please save me from this dull knife and epilepsy
5357876 gee mike i didnt even know white castle made cheddar bacon burgers
5357877 hahaha oh you lovable idiot i thought i would fool you its not white castle i made them myself thats why i call them sliders for copyright infringement purposes and because they slide right through your digestive system like a real white castle hamburger
5357878 oh um gee why would you want to do that
5357879 good point all i know is i dont know how it would even be possible to make these without a specialized piece of equipment to assist you and also where you found this delicious recipe
5357880 well its not possible to make them without a specialized piece of equipment which is why i purchased the big city slider station and the recipe is a favorite of this man on television who im sometimes scared is going to hit me through the screen somehow

5357887 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
5357888 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
5357889 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
5357890 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
5357891 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
5357892 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
5357893 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

5357896 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
5357897 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
5357898 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
5357899 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
5357900 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
5357901 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
5357902 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
5357903 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

5357911 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
5357912 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
5357913 tratamos de producir obras de denuncia claras y provocadoras que hagan reaccionar a la prensa y suscitar esfuerzos de destruccion de la obra por parte de aquellos que no puedan soportarla haciendo mucho ruido y volviendo accesible el mensaje a los que no pertenecen al campo
5357914 hice abundante cosecha de esqueletos y craneos en los cementerios de los indigenas sometidos que vivian en las inmediaciones del azul y en blanca grande
5357915 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
5357916 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
5357917 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
5357918 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
5357919 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e
5357920 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche

5357922 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos

5357924 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
5357925 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
5357926 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
5357927 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos

5357939 for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms
5357940 its amazing when you see so many dead people you stop feeling very much about it one way or the other
5357941 on the one hand consumers when looking for a hybrid will have a wide variety of body styles and vehicles to choose from
5357942 also the auto makers will be monitoring each others cars and look to better each other that should advance the electric hybrid platform quicker
5357943 on the other hand all of this concentration runs the risk of leaving other new fuel saving technologies behind delaying their development
5357944 automakers should allocate more dollars to other technologies such as hydrogen powered cars
5357945 ethanol used to hold that title but its losing favor as its impact on food prices and the environment become more clear
5357946 focusing on electric hybrids will delay hydrogen technology development and that would be a mistake in my interpretation
5357947 we would be putting too many eggs in one basket from a car transportation technology standpoint
5357948 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion

5357961 virgin hair can be waxed so successfully that growth can be permanently stopped in just 2 to 6 sessions save your child a lifetime of waxing and put the money in the bank for her college education instead
5357962 some kids come in with their mothers when the mothers are getting waxed so they want to do it too one 10 year old had thick hair coming down her leg and she had a bikini and leg wax because she couldnt go to camp like that without getting teased
5357963 were just exploding with pride and joy at our athletes phenomenal performance so far and we want to show how much it means to us here in jamaica
5357964 these athletes are truly outstanding and our nation is overflowing with pride
5357965 its both our honor and our pleasure to welcome our heroes back from their exceptional performance in beijing
5357966 this camp is good opportunity for us to see the players after their off season break
5357967 most of the players have just started or are about to start their respective domestic competitions and we can now start focusing of the world cup qualifiers which are just around the corner
5357968 feelings have been tepid in general because the release of 400 prisoners and detainees will not solve the problem of political prisoners which now number 7 500 there is great concern in all of the houses of political prisoners regarding this matter

5357971 the roosevelt party ran on economic issues and didnt care whether voters were in favor of sex or against it on principle as long as they supported the new deal the mcgovern party by contrast has made social issues its litmus test
5357972 economic conservatives have had a home in the mcgovern party
5357973 as long as they support abortion rights and affirmative action but social democrats and populists who are pro life or anti affirmative action are not made nearly as welcome
5357974 we might roll down the shutters we got built in generators

5357977 we dont want people to focus on the exact track this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5357978 we want every every floridian and guest to be a survivor
5357979 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5357980 you know one or two might slip through but its a good deal
5357981 we have been in fruitful discussion with the health and education authorities and we are satisfied that the programme to be rolled out across the country now is a responsible and ethically appropriate one
5357982 we wanted to make sure any support materials were appropriate in the catholic schools and we didnt want hpv and cervical cancer to be linked with artificial contraception the factual information about the vaccine and cervical cancer are still there but it doesnt promote particular kinds of sexual behaviour we had discussions about it we looked at various forms of words and came to an agreement it took some months
5357983 the hpv vaccination will only protect young women from two strains of hpv leading to cervical cancer it is critically important that young people understand the need to use condoms to protect them from other stis
5357984 this message should be highlighted and underlined please remember this injection doesnt protect you from sexually transmitted diseases or becoming pregnant
5357985 the moral position is being imposed upon them it seems a bit archaic to let the catholic church decide on this
5357986 the hpv vaccine is about saving lives and protecting future generations of young girls from cervical cancer
5357987 the habit of religion is oppressive an easy way out of thought
5357988 religion with or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things but for good people to do evil things that takes religion
5357989 it is grindingly creakingly crashingly obvious that if darwinism was really a theory of chance it could not work
5357990 the trouble is that god in this sophisticated physicists sense bears no resemblance to the god of the bible or any other religion
5357991 the widower bhutto and his men are extremely unpopular removing musharraf who is even more unpopular might win the politicians badly needed popular support but not for long pakistans venal politicians decided to move against him after the army chief ashfaq kayani let it be known that there would be no military action to defend his former boss
5357992 peron said that by now hopefully madonna has realised that her daughter lourdes is a reincarnated evita peron
5357993 it seems that madonna spent so much time at evitas grave doing research for her film role as evita that evita herself took over madonnas body during filming
5357994 those among us who are sensitive to this kind of thing can actually see eva peron going into madonnas body when she sings dont cry for me argentina in the balcony scene
5357995 evita chose madonna as a mother figure and became lourdes madonna fell pregnant with lourdes while she was making the film

5358004 the strength of the constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure
5358005 todays supreme court decision is yet another stinging rebuke of the bush administrations extreme views on executive power time after time the supreme court has rebuffed the administrations attempts to undermine the constitution from its rasul and hamdi decisions in 2004 to its hamdan decision in 2006 it is a testament to our system of government that the court has rejected the habeas stripping provisions of the military commissions act and reaffirmed that the government does not have the power to detain people indefinitely and arbitrarily without judicial review the writ of habeas corpus provides one of the most significant protections of human freedom against arbitrary government action ever created we can and must fight terrorists without abandoning the principles on which our country was founded
5358006 the constitution only gives people the right to pursue happiness you have to catch it yourself
5358007 the constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government lest it come to dominate our lives and interests
5358008 no provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man than that which protects the rights of conscience against the enterprises of the civil authority
5358009 we the people are the rightful masters of both congress and the courts not to overthrow the constitution but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution
5358010 dont interfere with anything in the constitution that must be maintained for it is the only safeguard of our liberties
5358011 i prefer a man who will burn the flag and then wrap himself in the constitution to a man who will burn the constitution and then wrap himself in the flag

5358013 the proposed resolution calls on the apa to unequivocally condemn the use of torture its failed to respond to torture complaints over the past two years the apa has been silent on conditions of confinement and extraordinary renditions the apa has recommended that psychologists act as safety officers thats not psychologists role thats the red cross role theres complicity when psychologists act within the system
5358014 this the protest is part of the democratic process which the apa understands there is a proposed referendum and well let it run its course it was mailed on august first to the membership and there is a 45 day open ballot which passes by a simple majority the policy of the apa is not to condone torture
5358015 it looks like they got away with it scot free

5358020 maybe some people are wired to be more sexual and also to have better erections for a longer period of time
5358021 do as the spirit moves you and make decisions about sexuality that are comfortable for you and your partner
5358022 if we put it onto our calendar when we have to have sex i think we lose the positive effect of sex on health
5358023 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5358024 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5358025 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5358026 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5358027 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5358028 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5358029 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5358030 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5358031 we really want to get the message out to people
5358032 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment

5358035 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5358036 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5358037 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5358038 they need it today it would be wonderful today if they had it and got the kids off the street and into a camp like that work hard and earn money and learn what life is all about
5358039 remember when i told yall that he was a mirror image of me but you wouldnt listen
5358040 i meant that in every way all he needed was his confidence to be where it is right now the guy is playing flat out great ball and i see that continuing to grow
5358041 hes really a guy that has to be feared out there
5358042 we were watching film of the carolina panthers game and everybody in the room was like oooooooohhhhh aaaaaahhhh play after play q is out there just throwing his body around and hitting people him and dawk he goes out there and knocks heads around and thats all you can ask for from a strong safety
5358043 i think the games i started last year just got me used to being out there and i learned a lot so now im at a level where im not thinking that much just going out there and playing
5358044 a lot of times when youre in a step in role like i was last year youre a little hesitant you might see a play but youre scared to make a mistake you dont want to look bad i kind of got through that phase now im at the phase where i know and im going to go after it no matter what and nine times out of 10 my decision is going to be the right one i have that comfort level now
5358045 my gut sense is that special teams are coming along now and i think i need to focus on defense
5358046 its pretty hard to run down there on kickoff and then turning around and covering guys its pretty tough and theres just a lot more studying that comes about when youre starting i think special teams will be fine but if in fact im needed out there i will be out there well see what happens in the regular season
5358047 dont you wish sometimes that north carolina had some interesting political characters who were just a little bit naughty

5358052 inmates can make calls and conduct criminal enterprises from a cell phone
5358053 we owe it to the victims to not allow inmates to continue to run their enterprises from behind our bars
5358054 inmates can make calls and conduct criminal enterprises from a cell phone if we dont try to limit that
5358055 the cell phones are utilized to go around get unrestricted access to the community and thats not a good thing things can occur bad things can occur that way
5358056 i first really wasnt too keen on the idea i didnt think theyd be able to separate the odor of the phone versus a lot of the stuff thats in the institution
5358057 these institutions are like cities and a lot of goods and materials and people have to come in and out all the time
5358058 we bring in boxes truckloads of things all the time so we have to have methods and procedures and policies to search these things and keep them out
5358059 those are the ones that were looking for and those are the ones we have zero tolerance for
5358060 theyre jeopardizing everybody else that works in the facility and we cannot tolerate that
5358061 well weve had them flush em down the toilets and weve had them throw em off the upper levels of some of the tiers

5358296 but anyone who wants condoms birth control pills or the plan b emergency contraceptive will be turned away
5358297 critics say the stores could create dangerous obstacles for women seeking legal safe and widely used birth control methods
5358298 a pharmacy like this is walling off an essential part of health care that could endanger womens health
5358299 letter to his customers telling them he would no longer be filling their prescriptions for contraception
5358300 i was and will be willing to lose the business in order to not be a part of something that i dont agree with
5358301 the koelzers have chosen not to use birth control they have nine children
5358302 austin more than 20 doctors who have prescribed psychiatric drugs to foster children have also been disciplined by the state some for allegations as serious as sexually exploiting a patient or missing a fatal drug complication
5358303 opened 40 clinics in beijings 18 districts and counties to offer free hiv tests and aids counseling
5358304 we basically said oh my gosh this is a big story and weve got to cover it
5358305 its because of something i call the been there done that disease
5358306 we hear about the young vote all the time and at the end of the day does it show up
5358307 we are seeing a partisan divide between young and old like we havent seen before
5358308 the fact is most people are simply unaware of the full functionality of the product
5358309 by being first to market by having a high quality product and by providing high levels of service i think you can build a brand and establish yourself as a premier resource
5358310 within a corporation people are using google every day whether it is sales marketing research and development human resources and recruiting
5358311 the product is ubiquitous in its business use and yet people are not taking advantage of the functionality
5358312 we think the google piece of it is an overlooked piece
5358313 people just take for granted that everybody googles and nobody stops and thinks twice about the inefficiency in the process
5358314 if being led to my doom by a gps voice is my destiny so be it
5358315 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5358316 weve got a saying up here that the odds are good but the goods are odd
5358317 bernimm die rolle eines aufstrebenden meisters der kampfkunst und folge dem pfad der offenen hand oder der geschlossenen faust in diesem preisgekr nten action rollenspiel bestimmen deine entscheidungen und handlungen das schicksal des ganzen reiches kannst du die zerst rung dieses wundersch nen landes verhindern oder wirst du es gar selbst zerschmettern bist du ein krieger der st rke und meisterlichen kampf einsetzt um frieden zu bringen oder stehst du f r schmerz und untergang

5358319 the emergence of the hacktivist is arguably an inevitability after all the internet is a virtual extension of almost all aspects of our lives with some good and some bad
5358320 if you are using a wireless connection make sure you secure your network by switching on the wpa or wep encryption rename your network ssid and switch off ssid broadcast so that would be hackers wont be able to find you as easily
5358321 arab hacktivism then if left to spawn could also garner interest from the script kiddie community
5358322 the script kiddie is normally someone who is not especially technically sophisticated but who randomly seeks out weaknesses in systems without necessarily understanding what they are exploiting sometimes the weaknesses were in fact discovered and exploited by someone else and made public
5358323 trend micros threat research division has documented occurrences of hacktivism during the recent social and political unrest in china where hacktivists unsuccessfully launched a distributed denial of service ddos attack on cnn as a protest against coverage deemed as pro tibet
5358324 hacktivism could bring about large economic losses as well as potentially severe damage to the national infrastructure affecting global markets and public safety
5358325 like any malware hacktivism threatens user data and credibility compromising systems by making them work against their owners or not work at all
5358326 so shouldnt we take it upon ourselves to keep the internet as pure as we need it to be it may be asking a lot to bring any real degree of purity to an already heavily besmirched wasteland like the internet but if internet users exercised more sustainable usage habits it will bear fruit in the years to come

5358477 he muhammad is the messenger of allah and the seal of the prophets
5358478 did they not consider yanzuru the kingdom of the heavens and earth
5358479 thus do we make clear the communications for a people who reflect quran 10 24
5358480 had we sent down this quran on a mountain you would certainly have seen it falling down splitting asunder because of the fear of allah and we set forth these parables to humankind that they may reflect
5358481 the likeness of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seeing and the hearing are they equal in condition will you not then mind
5358482 the likeness of this worlds life is only as water which we send down from the cloud then the herbage of the earth of which men and cattle eat grows luxuriantly thereby until when the earth puts on its golden raiment and it becomes garnished and its people think that they have power over it our command comes to it by night or by day so we render it as reaped seed produce as though it had not been in existence yesterday thus do we make clear the communications for a people who reflect
5358483 allah is the light of the heavens and the earth a likeness of his light is as a niche in which is a lamp the lamp is in a glass and the glass is as it were a brightly shining star lit from a blessed olive tree neither eastern nor western the oil whereof almost gives light though fire touch it not light upon light allah guides to his light whom he pleases and allah sets forth parables for men and allah is cognizant of all things
5358484 this then is allah your god the lord the truth your true lord
5358485 do you not see that god created the heavens and earth through with truth
5358486 he did not create the heavens and earth and what is between them except through with truth
5358487 indeed there have come to you clear proofs from your lord whoever will therefore see it is for his own soul and whoever will be blind it shall be against him and i am not a keeper over you
5358488 if you are godfearing have taqwa he will give you discrimination
5358489 be godfearing have taqwa and god will teach you quran 2 282
5358490 god knows the secret sirr and that which is more hidden kafi
5358491 even in a challenging economic environment we have seen some exciting progress
5358492 as the fiscal year approached its end we saw our momentum increase resulting in the second best month of june fundraising in university history
5358493 i am grateful to our many friends and supporters who see the difference that investing in georgetown can make
5358494 these contributions are one part of our overall strategy to strengthen the universitys finances and be able to make important investments in faculty facilities and financial aid
5358495 this past years achievement demonstrates that this strategy is having an impact
5358496 by prioritizing the universitys needs and understanding what alumni parents and friends are interested in we are better able to align their philanthropic interests with georgetowns needs
5358497 and whoever acts hostilely to the apostle after that guidance has become manifest to him and follows other than the way of the believers we will turn him to that to which he has himself turned
5358498 no soul benefits except from its own works and none bears the burden of another ultimately you return to your lord then he informs you regarding all your disputes
5358499 and if all the trees in the earth were pens and the sea with seven more seas to help it were ink the words of allah could not be exhausted
5358500 what are these books that i heard you wrote i am just a human being anyone who has any of these writings should bring it here
5358501 do not write anything from me except quran anyone who wrote anything other than the quran shall erase it
5358502 the messenger of god ordered us never to write down anything of his hadith
5358503 he who obeys the messenger obeys god and whoever turns back we have not sent you as a keeper over them
5358504 whatsoever the messenger ordains you should accept and whatsoever he forbids you should abstain from
5358505 enjoin the good and forbid the evil and bear patiently that which befalls you surely these acts require courage
5358506 call to the way of your lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation and have disputations with them in the best manner
5358507 so turn away from them and say peace for they shall soon come to know
5358508 and the servants of the beneficent god are they who walk on the earth in humbleness and when the ignorant address them they say peace
5358509 and as for those who follow the right direction he increases them in guidance and gives them their guarding against evil quran 47 17
5358510 we raise by grades whom we will and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing
5358511 we shall show them our signs upon the horizons and in themselves until it is clear to them that god is the real quran 41 53
5358512 the real has come and the unreal has vanished away lo falsehood is ever bound to vanish
5358513 the faithful spirit has descended with it upon your heart that you may be of the warners in plain arabic language
5358514 o humankind there has come to you a direction from your lord and a healing for the diseases in the hearts and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
5358515 what is the person whose heart allah has opened to islam so that such an individual is in a light from his lord like the hard hearted nay woe to those whose hearts are hard against the remembrance of allah those are in clear error
5358516 the words of god do not change la tabdila fi kalimati llah
5358517 and do not make haste with the quran before its revelation is made complete to you and say o my lord increase me in knowledge
5358518 and who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against allah or gives the lie to his communications surely the unjust will not be successful quran 6 21 to interpret the quran is in effect to forge a lie with respect to the word of god
5358519 o humankind we have created you from a male and a female and made you tribes and peoples so that you may know each other surely the most honorable among you with allah is the one who has taqwa
5358520 those will prosper who purify tazakka themselves and glorify the name of their guardian lord and lift their hearts in prayer
5358521 wa huwa maakum aynama kuntum and he is with you wherever you are
5358522 most surely it is an honored quran in a book that is protected none shall touch it save the purified ones quran 56 77 79
5358523 lo ritual worship preserves one from lewdness and iniquity and verily remembrance of allah is more important quran 29 45
5358524 and man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good and man is ever hasty
5358525 o people you are the poor toward god and god is the independent the praiseworthy
5358526 what is with you comes to an end but what is with god remains
5358527 o prophet we have put you on the right way shariah concerning the religion so follow it and do not yield to the desires of ignorant people
5358528 i have not created human beings nor jinn except that they may worship me
5358529 the seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein praise god and there is nothing that does not glorify god in praise but you do not understand its manner of praise
5358530 the words of god do not change la tabdila fi kalimati llah
5358531 go into the houses by their doors and be careful with respect to allah that you may be successful
5358532 evil is the likeness of the people who reject our communications and are unjust to their own souls
5358533 surely we have revealed the book to you with the truth that you might discern between people by means of that which allah has taught you or has you see and be not an advocate on behalf of the treacherous
5358534 and we do not send emissaries but as announcers of good news and givers of warning then whoever believes and acts aright they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
5358535 no soul can believe except by the will of allah and he will place doubt obscurity on those who will not understand quran 10 100
5358536 no soul can believe except by the will of allah
5358537 so they found one of our abds abdan min ibadina on whom we had bestowed a mercy from us and we taught him knowledge from our presence ladunna
5358538 der beschuldigte leidet gutachtern zufolge an einer krankhaften seelischen st rung und hatte zudem zur tatzeit cannabis konsumiert
5358539 no soul shall have imposed on it a duty but to the extent of its capacity
5358540 we do not impose on any soul a duty except to the extent of its ability
5358541 and we do not lay on any soul a burden except to the extent of its ability quran 23 62
5358542 we do not impose on any soul a duty except to the extent of its ability
5358543 allah does not impose upon any soul a duty but to the extent of its ability for it is the benefit of what it has earned and upon it the evil of what it has wrought our lord
5358544 what i have commanded you to do perform it to the extent that you are able and refrain from what i have forbidden you to do

5358568 companies spend very big bucks on what types of sounds and music activate this behavior its kind of scary in a way were not aware of it its very subconscious
5358569 music doesnt just influence our buying behavior but it also perceives how we view the quality of the service slow pop music and fast classical selections make consumers think the merchandise and quality are better
5358570 the purpose is not to engage you in the song they want the music to activate the parts of the brain that get you to engage in the types of behavior they want

5358604 phil has great integrity and has not been afraid to show leadership often speaking the truth even when it was inconvenient for established interests to hear it
5358605 phil has consistently spoken out with great passion and courage articulating how a national high speed broadband network would produce enormous benefits for communities and the national economy
5358606 phil has made a very large positive impact on the culture and success of telstra and like all employees i am grateful to him for the leadership he showed

5358612 for what blessings can be more suitable to an ignorant sinner than good judgment and knowledge knowledge of ourselves of our saviour of the way of obedience and good judgement to apply this knowledge to some valuable end
5358613 these two parts of our intellectual furniture have a most important connexion and dependence upon each other knowledge is the speculative perception of general truth judgement is the practical application of it to the heart and conduct no school but the school of christ no teaching but the teaching of the spirit can ever give this good judgement and knowledge

5358640 from where i stand sigler is at the top of the tree
5358641 an exciting read and very highly recommended for all science fiction enthusiasts earthcore would be a popular addition to community library scifi collections and documents scott sigler as an effective entertaining storyteller
5358642 this novels got it all cutting edge science a perfectly realized setting terror both plausible and profoundly unsettling earthcore is more exciting than a thriller has any right to be
5358643 bad things happen to bad people in this book then they happen some more very bad things things that make you wonder just what sort of childhood the author must have lived through no way im going caving with him anytime soon or letting him near knives in my presence
5358644 earthcore is in your face steel tipped boot on your throat speed metal fiction nail biting suspense and non stop action breathe life into his debut novel
5358645 one thing i particularly like is that sigler didnt pull his punches or cop out at any point all the threats lined up at the beginning of the book were delivered on before the end in fact i strongly recommend that you not get too attached to any characters as sigler is ruthless at culling them throughout the novel
5358646 theres a lot to recommend this book and anyone who enjoys sf thrillers will enjoy this
5358647 earthcore may be considered a sci fi novel but i would rate it right up there with some of my favorite creepy horror novels earthcore is a fantastic choice to add to your bookshelf
5358648 carlos tevez will be back for the portsmouth match next week and wayne rooney will be much sharper and much fitter and in the second half it started to show for him but unfortunately campbell also picked up an injury and i had to take him off so we were asking wayne to play through the middle when hes really needing games and it was a big ask

5358724 necesidades imperiosas de reformas importantes pero no estructurales en las viviendas como reformas en ba os o introducci n de ascensores es decir problemas que se agravan con las dificultades sociales del casco como poner de acuerdo a comunidades peque as para la solicitud de ayudas y creo que la iniciativa p blica debe jugar un papel importante
5358725 son dif cilmente rehabilitables y exigen intervenciones duras que se pueden hacer desde lo p blico y transformaciones potentes y duras en determinadas zonas
5358726 existen casas en muy mal estado y que pr cticamente es necesario el derribo pero sus habitantes no tienen capacidad econ mica para hacerlo y s lo se puede hacer desde la v a p blica se necesitan reformas de gran magnitud
5358727 todas estas actuaciones as como la dinamizaci n social y cultural del casco exigen un plan integral que permita que se apoyen las unas en las otras y que permita sacar adelante esta zona tan importante para la ciudad la herramienta adecuada son los planes integrales que son necesarios reforzar y dotar econ micamente
5358728 ha jugado un papel muy importante en la rehabilitaci n de viviendas y debe empezar a tratar tambi n el caso de derribos de viviendas ya que ltimamente se han derrumbado algunas y han provocado problemas de seguridad en las calles los habitantes de esos edificios no hacen frente a las necesidades de una reforma de estas caracter sticas y tampoco se puede expropiar para hacer obras ya que cuesta un dinero al que no pueden hacer frente
5358729 es necesario un programa integral y que los vecinos puedan conocer las ayudas y subvenciones sa es una de las cuestiones pendientes en las que es necesaria la inversi n econ mica pero tambi n la voluntad pol tica de sa hemos estado ausente en zaragoza en los ltimos 20 a os
5358730 se est actuando con las ayudas de rehabilitaci n para las necesidades de reformas de ba os ascensores pero es una subvenci n parcial cuando hay una degradaci n grande de la vivienda o no son habitables eso exige planes integrales de rehabilitaci n y una pol tica urban stica y de vivienda adecuada

5358733 es fundamental analizar y ver cual es el papel del estado de la administraci n de cada municipio y de las empresas privadas

5358779 it was approximately two miles from the runway we believe it had been cleared to land by coventry airport air traffic control when it was in collision with a smaller single engine light aircraft

5358811 a sprawling indictment of eight u s administrations hendon and stewart appear nonpartisan in their disdain for governmental inaction and double dealing a convincing urgent argument
5358812 this man was absolutely endearing this is a man who is awkward and idealistic in a my name is earl kind of way he talked to real people his aim was to attempt to give the average american a broader view of life and real people in the middle east the view of american culture and american government from the outside and a better understanding of the effect of the afghanistan and iraq wars on those countries the way he did it was subtle and brilliant he talked to real people in the middle eastern countries that he visited which were mostly war torn countries that make the worst ghetto in america look like the white house but in the middle of the all this is his comic view of everything it is that light touch that enables the viewer to open themselves up a little and be comfortable with a subject that is heated in this country and across the world
5358813 i thought it was absolutely spectacular it definitely played to the audience it was funny and catchy enough to make it easy to follow most political movies present their perspective in a way that is so contradictory that in the end its just confusing the problem is they polarize the issues and it makes the viewer have to choose a side this movie didnt do that it chose a hot button issue and reflected on it in a way that showed what it was really about rather than how its usually portrayed he talked in a humanitarian way rather than talking about politics thats what i loved about it
5358814 i felt like it presented the middle eastern viewpoint with a childlike niavete by wrapping such a deep issue in such a simple manner its able to inform and enlighten the average viewer sure it didnt touch on the intense social complexities of the issue but its message was clear cut we are all human

5358820 biggest overhaul of legislation on domestic violence in 30 years
5358821 there was a reduction in the number of applications and orders following july 2007 when the new measure was implemented but this reduction was more pronounced for orders than it was for applications the decreases are larger than in previous years
5358822 it must also be remembered that the dvcv act actually extended the availability of non molestation and occupation orders and hence we would expect to see an increase in orders granted and not a decrease overall
5358823 those engaged with the court process felt there had been a reduction in applications for non molestation orders and orders granted since july 2007 either due to both a reduction in the availability of legal aid and the criminalisation of breaches or because victims were concerned about potential imprisonment that follows a breach
5358824 although the government has made some important and effective strides in tackling domestic violence it is undermining its own efforts because the measures are isolated and unsupported as this study suggests however strong one initiative may be it will have a limited impact if its not inextricably linked across all areas of policy and so women at risk of violence will continue to fall through the gaps
5358825 government figures show the number of domestic violence cases being reported has increased the success rate on prosecuting domestic violence continues to improve
5358826 in 2007 both family and criminal jurisdictions of court helped 22 975 more victims than we did in 2004 this is a significant improvement against the background of an increasing volume of prosecutions this is a testament to the growing confidence victims have that they will be listened to and their reports effectively investigated coupled with the specialist and practical support victims receive
5358827 because the police and the cps have targets to meet what we also find is that when arrests are made perpetrators are only charged if the cps considers it a case that is likely to be successfully prosecuted and this leads to offences often being downgraded or dropped altogether

5358839 it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5358840 boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5358841 young people need to understand that carrying a knife just like carrying a gun is dangerous and wrong
5358842 but government and the police cant solve this problem by themselves we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models

5358863 he was swinging the bat well i saw him raise the level of his play he was getting the bat head out in front of the ball before the game i was saying what a catalyst he can be for us
5358864 i just happened to swing the bat a little better
5358865 i dont think ive ever done that even in the minors
5358866 but i told pitching coach jimmy hickey if we walk young to load the bases were going to walk hamilton i just thought that was prudent with the kind of year hamilton has been having i wouldnt say its spectacular its beyond that he very easily could have hit a grand slam there
5358867 i was hoping that hamilton would get the chance to swing the bat but joe didnt let that happen i still felt good with marlon up there he had a couple pitches that he could have done something with he just didnt do it
5358868 being able to go out in that sixth inning was huge i was relaxed my slider was working i got a lot of called strikes and a couple of swinging strikes with it

5358871 we know when hes aggressive it puts the rest of us in an aggressive mode
5358872 hes the one starting out who really gets us going when he picks it up everyone usually follows
5358873 this is what hes been dreaming of to get the chance to play in the olympics go out there and lead a team and hes doing a great job of that
5358874 hes been very consistent every night on the defensive end and on the offensive end i really appreciate the way he leads the team he makes everybody around him better

5358896 in the old days it was expected that about half the children in a family would die before they grew up this involved pain illness and sorrow to the mother often great suffering to the children and a waste of natural resources in the care of children who never lived to become productive
5358897 such a state of affairs will have both merits and demerits more important than either however is the fact that nothing less will enable a society imbued with scientific technique to survive scientific technique demands organization and the more it becomes perfected the larger are the organizations that it demands quite apart from war the present depression has made it evident that an international organization of credit and banking is necessary to the prosperity not only of some countries but of all the international organization of industrial production is being rendered necessary by the efficiency of modern methods modern industrial plants can easily supply in many directions much more than the total needs of the world the result of this which should be wealth is in fact poverty owing to competition in the absence of competition the immensely enhanced productivity of labour would enable men to arrive at a just compromise between leisure and goods they could choose whether they would work six hours a day and be rich or four hours a day and enjoy only moderate comfort the advantages of world wide organization both in preventing the waste of economic competition and in removing the danger of war are so great as to be becoming an essential condition for the survival of societies possessing scientific technique this argument is overwhelming in comparison with all counterarguments and renders almost unimportant the question whether life in an organized world state will be more or less satisfactory than life at the present day for it is only in the direction of an organized world state that the human race can develop unless it abandons scientific technique and it will not do this except as the result of a cataclysm so severe as to lower the whole level of civilization the advantages to be derived from an organized world state are great and obvious there will be in the first place security against war and a saving of almost the whole effort and expense now devoted to competitive armaments there will be one must suppose a single highly efficient fighting machine employing mainly aeroplanes and chemical methods of warfare which will be quite obviously irresistible and will therefore not be resisted the central government may be changed from time to time by a palace revolution but this will only alter the personnel of the figure heads not the essential organization of government the central government will of course forbid the propaganda of nationalism by means of which at present anarchy is maintained and will put in its place a propaganda of loyalty to the world state
5358898 we have seen that scientific civilization demands world wide organization if it is to be stable we have considered the possibility of such an organization in matters of government we shall now consider it in the economic sphere at present production is organized as far as possible nationally be means of tariff walls every nation tries to produce at home as much as possible of the goods that it consumes this tendency is on the increase and even great britain which has hitherto aimed at maximizing its exports by means of free trade appears to be on the point of abandoning this policy in favour of comparative economic isolation it is of course clear that from a purely economic point of view it is wasteful to organize production nationally rather than internationally it would be an economy if all the motor cars used throughout the world were manufactured in detroit that is to say a car of given excellence could be produced with less expense of human labour in that case than it can at present in a world scientifically organized most industrial products would be thus localized there would be one place for making pins and needles another place for making scissors and knives another place for making aeroplanes and yet another for agricultural machinery when if ever the world government that we have considered comes into being one of its first tasks will be the international organization of production production will no longer be left as at present to private enterprise but will be undertaken solely in accordance with government orders this is already the case with such things as battleships because in regard to war efficiency is thought to be important but in most matters production is left to the chaotic impulses of private manufacturers who make too much of some things and too little of others with the result that there is poverty in the midst of unused plenty the industrial plant at present existing in the world is in many directions far in excess of the worlds needs by eliminating competition and concentrating production in a single concern all this waste could be avoided the control of raw materials is a matter which in any scientific society would be governed by a central authority at present the important raw materials are controlled by military power the weak nation possessed of oil soon finds itself under suzerainty of some stronger nation the transvaal lost its independence because it contained gold raw material ought not to belong to those who by conquest or diplomacy have happened to acquire the territory in which they are they ought to belong to a world authority which would ration them to those who had the most skill in utilizing them moreover our present economic system causes everybody to be wasteful of raw materials since there is no motive for foresight in a scientific world the supply of any vital raw material will be carefully estimated and as the moment of its exhaustion approaches scientific research will be directed to the discovery of a substitute agriculture for reasons which we considered in an earlier chapter may have less importance in the future than it has at present and has had in the past we shall have not only artificial silk but artificial wool and artificial timber and artificial rubber in time we may have artificial food but in the meantime agriculture will become more and more industrialized both in its methods and in the mentality of those who practise it american and canadian agriculturists have already the industrial mentality not the mentality of the patient peasant machinery will of course be increasingly employed in the neighbourhood of large urban markets intensive cultivation with artificial methods of warming the soil will yield many crops every year here and there throughout the country side there will be large power stations forming the nucleus around which the population will cluster of agricultural mentality as it has been known since ancient times nothing will survive since the soil and even the climate will be subject to human control
5358899 the gain from an economic point of view will be enormous there will be no waste in competitive production no uncertainty as to employment no poverty no sudden alternations of good and bad times every man willing to work will be kept in comfort and every man unwilling to work will be kept in prison when owing to any circumstances the work upon which a man has hitherto been employed is no longer required he will be taught some new kind of work and will be adequately maintained while he is learning his new trade economic motives will be employed to regulate population which will probably be kept stationary almost all that is tragic in human life will be eliminated and even death will seldom come before old age
5358900 it may be assumed that every man and woman will be obliged to work and will be taught a new trade if for any reason work at the old trade is no longer required the pleasantest work of course will be that which gives the most control over the mechanism the posts giving most power will presumably be awarded to the ablest men as a result of intelligence tests for entirely inferior work negroes will be employed wherever possible one may i suppose assume that the most desirable kinds of work will be more highly paid than the less desirable kinds since they require more skill the society will not be one in which there is equality although i doubt whether the inequalities will be hereditary except as between different races i e between white and coloured labour everybody will be comfortable and those who occupy the better paid posts will be able to enjoy considerable luxury there will not be as at present fluctuations of good and bad times for these are merely the result of our anarchic economic system nobody will starve and nobody will suffer the economic anxieties which at present beset rich and poor alike on the other hand life will be destitute of adventure except for the most highly paid experts ever since civilization began men have been seeking security more avidly than they have sough anything else in such a world they will have it but i am not quite sure whether they will think it worth the price that they will have paid for it
5358901 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement

5358910 in spite of fawning media coverage an unpopular republican president and economic challenges democrat barack obama has not managed to build a very substantive lead over his republican rival john mccain recent polls show mccain closing the distance in key states and one national poll even had the republican candidate with a slight lead there are those that have of late attributed obamas lackluster polling to race it happens that they are correct but then barack obamas presidential run has always been about race it has not however been about race as we most often envision it as part and parcel of race ism most americans are tired of race and are looking to move beyond it in a concrete way obamas polling numbers have not stalled because he has hit the glass ceiling of white supremacy barack has struggled because americans no longer view him as a candidate that can transcend race many have in fact come to see him as ardently willing to manipulate race in order to gain a political advantage rather than representing a different kind of politician he then appears to be not so different from any number of liberal black politicians that have graced the political stage the polls have not moved because he is off message
5358911 the democratic senators enormous celebrity was not achieved through any perceived brilliance in the areas of economics or foreign policy the excitement of obama was the potential to realize a vision of an america that finally lives up to her promise a promise that is impossible so long as we are stratified by color and class consciousness what americans believed in was his ability to bring us one step closer to the embodiment of our national motto e pluribus unum out of many one the irony is that obama needs race without it the emperor has few clothes for 40 of voters his decidedly thin resume and new liberal policies are of little consequence the trick is in convincing 11 of voters in the middle that he can indeed provide change they can believe in
5358912 the violent discord between russia and georgia offers us the same tragic images that we have become aware of since vietnam when the blinders came off media cameras this violence cannot be stopped as easily as it was in bosnia finally this time as with the chinese actions in tibet there is nothing the world at large can do about it in or out of the united nations or nato the recent ceasefire cannot erase the horrific images we have already seen in georgia we recoil from seeing women lying in rubble screaming for help once again we have seen the streets littered with the dead who would be eaten by wandering dogs if not removed quickly thats war but it is also modern politics if the u s had wanted to invade iraq without democratic consent it could not have been stopped if china wants to annex tibet it does if russia wants to attack georgia it does the explanations are irrelevant because the world has to swallow it as is that is what great powers can do if they wish
5358913 we all must face the clausewitz dictum that war is a continuation of politics by other means good and evil are not part of the equation some will say that is not particularly modern it is only the way it has always been they are wrong now and again there are wars that live up to all of the moral purposes attached to them our civil war was one world war ii was surely another since then things have gotten much murkier we have heard many times that the old ussr fell at least partially because it could no longer hold at bay the information of how horribly its people lived in comparison to those in the decadent capitalist west things are quite different now oil and the western addiction to it have made russian life much more plush and china has the fastest growing economy on the planet there is now a surprising national pride connected to totalitarianism as one writer recently found among the young globetrotting chinese educated in western universities they make it clear that in china everyone assumes that the government feeds them propaganda but sees western countries as naive because citizens there dont understand that they too are the recipients of propaganda beyond that they believe that the government is doing a good job of running things even if it isnt concerned as the west is with human rights patience will work it out in the long run they claim to believe
5358914 this totalitarian capitalism as writer philip pan calls it benefits from actions or inactions that justify the disdain totalitarians have for democratic nations the chinese have found that western capitalists are not bothered by the slaughter of some unruly students or the bullying of some buddhists if as shown before and during the olympics it doesnt stop them from making big deals or big investments dear mao power does not come from the barrel of a gun but from a barrel of bucks so the new cynicism is proven right the running dogs of capitalism will heel if you have enough money not quite i have no idea how long it will take but i am sure that any system that does not move in our most enlightened direction is doomed from within what is that direction the good old all american sense of the ongoing struggle at the center of capitalism the battle to bring the profit motive in line with morality and ethics for instance the morality behind the civil war which was not at all against profit the point was that yes you can have people work for you no you cannot own them that is the point and no amount of profit or the decoys of material comfort will remove that point from the fate of society
5358915 georgians should have known better than to chart an independent course and what was the bush administration thinking when it encouraged them in their dangerous delusions
5358916 not determined to have committed any hostile acts against the united states or its coalition allies
5358917 barack obama the administration indeed and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them
5358918 john mccain shot from the hip very aggressive very belligerent statement he may or may not have complicated the situation
5358919 if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 35 for whoever wants to save his life c will lose it but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it 36 what good is it for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul 37 or what can a man give in exchange for his soul 38 if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his fathers glory with the holy angels

5358928 if only our diplomacy could be conducted in secret without any need to appeal to the wests electorates we need diplomats who are the intellectual heirs of castlereagh kissinger metternich salisbury and talleyrand with the temperaments of peter carrington or douglas hurd steeped in experience wisdom realism and cynicism
5358929 we live in the most privacy obsessed era in history yet our belief in the secrecy of private information exists alongside a frenzy of flagrant exhibitionism
5358930 requiring candidates to provide details about the years they attended school or the name of the school itself could reveal the candidates age religious affiliation and place of origin

5358953 obviously the message from the obama campaign is change and a new kind of politics
5358954 i wanted to send a message that change is not just words if you are going to say something you need to back it up
5358955 as much fun as you can have in a combat zone
5358956 pockets of iraq are humming along other sections not so much i think the government of iraq has to do things on its own you can only help them so much
5358957 we have to leave in a responsible manner that means playing hardball with the iraq government
5358958 the gospel does teach us about caring for our fellow man
5358959 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5358960 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5358961 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality
5358962 my recent experience of them is that theyre not john le carre graham greene its not that sort of tableau anymore
5358963 as an intelligence officer at mi5 youll be faced with some of the most challenging issues affecting national security today
5358964 the decisions you make will play a major part in our efforts to counterterrorism espionage the spread of weapons of mass destruction and in protecting the u k s critical national infrastructure

5358974 im not going to comment specifically on what russian units or equipment are in the area right now
5358975 but let me be clear if it rolled in after august 6th it needs to roll out that would be in keeping with the russians commitment on withdrawal
5358976 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5358977 we are confident that mi5 will in a few years time be a workplace that reflects modern society
5358978 i would always be excluded from school i was on the verge of being thrown out

5358989 thats wonderful honey but what about the eggs i scrambled them just the way you like
5358990 politics in washington are broken just like those eggs we can fix that by working hard together for our common future
5358991 look you can count on my vote but do you want these eggs or not
5358992 i believe every chicken thinks and prays about whether to lay each precious individual egg do some eggs get broken yes and its not our place to think that we can do a better job than that chicken of laying her eggs what i will commit to is agreeing in principle that we ought to do everything we can to reduce the number of broken eggs in this country thats compassion and its what i believe has been lacking in washington
5358993 barack its a simple question do you want some eggs
5358994 i believe washington is broken because we see things in black and white there are no easy answers what we need is leadership and commitment to change

5359001 to be an olympic champion is much better than being a world champion the truth is its a medal i really had to fight for
5359002 the 2007 world champion won with a best jump of 8 34 meters 10 centimeters longer than world indoor champion khotso mokoena of south africa who took silver ibrahim camejo of cuba was third at 8 20
5359003 i liked playing baseball at the time then my brother introduced me to athletics i started to enjoy it and here i am
5359004 i came to beijing in excellent shape today what i was looking for didnt quite happen what i really wanted was to improve my personal best of 8 73 i know im ready to do that today it just didnt happen but i had many things on my mind
5359005 im not totally satisfied but ive achieved my objective of being olympic champion and world champion
5359006 it will take away a symbol of hatred but the essential issues dont end with musharraf
5359007 its a virulent cancer that is eating into our society
5359008 the terrorists are not going to surrender they have long term objectives in the region
5359009 this is a positive change but it is just the beginning
5359010 if the government ends these policies the taliban will stop their activities immediately

5359013 the same machine that has toppled us is behind obama
5359014 ea is saying we want to pay less take two is saying they want more the important thing is that they are talking
5359015 on the one hand consumers when looking for a hybrid will have a wide variety of body styles and vehicles to choose from
5359016 also the auto makers will be monitoring each others cars and look to better each other that should advance the electric hybrid platform quicker
5359017 on the other hand all of this concentration runs the risk of leaving other new fuel saving technologies behind delaying their development
5359018 automakers should allocate more dollars to other technologies such as hydrogen powered cars
5359019 ethanol used to hold that title but its losing favor as its impact on food prices and the environment become more clear
5359020 focusing on electric hybrids will delay hydrogen technology development and that would be a mistake in my interpretation
5359021 we would be putting too many eggs in one basket from a car transportation technology standpoint
5359022 softening up the competition strategic implications of nokias decision to open up symbian
5359023 he was a batsman in top form but thats the way it goes in cricket you cant really stop and think about the guys you will be missing in the series rather than that you will have to fill in that space because that is the only way your team can win
5359024 we may look at a different combination of openers for the next game but its at a very initial stage we have just gone through the first game so whatever fits the team best well decide on that
5359025 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression you stopped a full scale operation
5359026 thank you for standing in the way of those who brought destruction and death to the people of the republic
5359027 you were the last hope of innocent people and your bravery saved lives
5359028 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5359029 what georgian authorities have done is beyond human understanding it cannot be understood and left unpunished
5359030 the world realized that even now there are political freaks who were ready to kill innocent people for the sake of political fashions and who compensated for their own stupidity by eliminating a whole nation
5359031 if someone thinks that our citizens can be killed soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers killed with impunity we will never permit that
5359032 i know i have behaved wrongly but that was my yesterday
5359033 today i have changed for the better and i am here to prove it i am determined to be myself and win everyones heart
5359034 we are in search of two other main culprits who were involved in the blasts they are taufiq bilal a mumbai based techie and qayamuddin a vadodara resident

5359037 tyrants and oppressors leave our kashmir as they marched past police barricades near the un military observer group in india and pakistan unmogip office in the summer capital srinagar
5359038 no solution to the kashmir issue other than merger with pakistan
5359039 we are pakistanis and pakistan is us because we are tied with the country through islam
5359040 do you have faith in my leadership i will be faithful to you till my death and will carry everyone along
5359041 we ask india to start a dialogue over kashmir open the srinagar muzaffarabad road for trade and release all kashmiris in indian jails

5359057 whats the best way to get from here to there
5359058 but most real networks are dynamic network links go up and down and thus some nodes need to recalculate their routes in response
5359059 is to tell everyone flood the topology change throughout the network and have each node re compute its table of best routes but that requirement to universally communicate and to act on each change is a big problem
5359060 being able to adapt to hardware failures is one of the fundamental characteristics of the internet
5359061 our routing algorithm reduces the overhead of route re computation after a network change making it possible to support larger networks the benefits are especially significant when networks are made up of low power devices of slow links
5359062 is in how information about changes in the network is propagated the xl routing algorithm propagates only some updates reducing the number of updates sent through the network
5359063 the rules ensure that selected routes are nearly as good as if complete information about the network were available
5359064 but at a fraction of the overhead required for maintaining such a state of perfect knowledge
5359065 you know this is going to be so excellent when it does hit the market full force
5359066 hey i like you to check this out maybe it is something that catholic answers will be interested in
5359067 tim what are you doing with the faith database well i mean are you doing anything with it marketing it selling it

5359073 it seems as though this product might be widely used across all christian denominations although with the decidedly catholic flavor is that true or is this really a specifically catholic only product
5359074 folks this is 2 000 years of christianity dive in and see what is says
5359075 hey this has helped me get more connected with the historical christian church
5359076 you got to be catholic and read this stuff and you will be and if you do not then that is your problem
5359077 what if any hoops did you have to jump through with the usccb the holy see or any other institutions that were involved with some of the materials that are on the database
5359078 well we will just put a link to the catechism for example on the internet
5359079 how many people were involved in the development and testing of the product
5359080 who you as third millennium are defining as your target audience for this product and how are you promoting it to your different people who would be interested in it
5359081 god wills that all men be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth
5359082 the name has been forwarded to the appointment committee headed by prime minister manmohan singh a formal announcement will be made soon
5359083 this culture of people holding foreign passports leaving the country as soon as they are forced to leave their powerful positions must stop they must be held accountable for their deeds shaukat aziz the former prime minister had gone abroad and no one could do anything against him
5359084 i fear ashraf will also leave for the states soon so his name should be put on the ecl until the probe into cricket affairs is completed
5359085 there should be separate divisions for everything but cricket affairs must be purely in the hand of former players and by former players i dont mean those who have played one or two games for their country
5359086 off the shelf solution to address their requirements this is true of both edward jones and progressive insurance but it is also true of other innovators such as enterprise rent a car
5359087 are young guys going to want to dress like them im not so sure i think gender alone will be somewhat of a challenge
5359088 our message is simple no matter where you drive country roads or urban highways from fenwick island to north wilmington if we catch you driving impaired we will arrest you
5359089 impaired drivers often think theyre safer on back roads they either believe that they can avoid running into a checkpoint or that officers wont be looking for them there
5359090 one of them is on oxygen another one is in a wheelchair to have handicapped seniors doing this is spectacular
5359091 you just slice it and fry it and its so tasty
5359092 all four partners went to university of texas for graduate school

5359094 the savings from this refinancing will help us with these important projects and others
5359095 you have a style of writing i just cant do
5359096 todays automotive designs use advanced cpus fpgas and asics which increases the number of board mounted power supplies
5359097 using lattices pac designer software tools designers can quickly implement and fine tune the power management algorithm used to control and monitor these diverse power supplies the resulting board specific power management design is more accurate requires less circuit board area and costs less than traditional designs using multiple off the shelf dedicated devices
5359098 wenn wir hornh ute verpflanzen nehmen wir die hornhaut von verstorbenen die hornhaut kann man noch drei tage nach dem tod entnehmen sie ist also sehr robust und wenn wir sie verpflanzen ist die prognose dass die patienten die die hornhaut erhalten hinterher wieder sehen k nnen sehr gut
5359099 companies spend very big bucks on what types of sounds and music activate this behavior its kind of scary in a way were not aware of it its very subconscious
5359100 music doesnt just influence our buying behavior but it also perceives how we view the quality of the service slow pop music and fast classical selections make consumers think the merchandise and quality are better
5359101 the purpose is not to engage you in the song they want the music to activate the parts of the brain that get you to engage in the types of behavior they want
5359102 you have different sensory experiences in the spa and the locker room
5359103 we dont want to play the same music that everybody else plays
5359104 just like god put so many wonderful people in my life you take the same thing take the people that he has put in your life and make sure that you are somebody that he put in their life
5359105 all week long ive had to deal with michael phelps questions about whos the greatest olympian of all time is he the greatest or is carl or so and so the greatest i was olympian of the century and since the century is over they cant take that away
5359106 theres going to be incredible disappointments and frustrations and not everyone will win a medal and so we want to be there to help bring jesus christ to the center of this highlight in their life
5359107 qwest is well prepared to handle all of the data content that will be streaming through the democratic national convention
5359108 never before has speed played such an important role in a national convention and qwest is excited for the world to see the capabilities of our network infrastructure
5359109 condition is very mild and at worst manifests itself in an inability to tie his shoe laces and bad handwriting
5359110 i mean listen its his year and why not have him hit a grand slam right there and really screw up ours
5359111 it was the right move in the right spot when the guys al manager of the year like hes going to be things go your way
5359112 when police investigate police there is favouritism in the investigation
5359113 it was seen right away in this case when they failed to interview the witness officer immediately
5359114 there is a lack of political will to take on the powerful police unions
5359115 it takes a strong public security minister to say i am in charge here and i am going to be making the decisions
5359116 clearly we are on a slippery slope here already there are people saying injection sites are not enough that government should give out heroin for free others are now calling for inhalation rooms for people who smoke their drugs
5359117 insite may slow the death spiral of a deadly drug habit but it does not reverse it i do not regard this as a positive health outcome
5359118 unknown substance or purity or potency drugs that cannot otherwise be legally prescribed

5359120 the letter and article from the cma supported the supervised injection site saying there is growing evidence that harm reduction efforts can have a positive effect on the poor health outcomes associated with drug use
5359121 over the last five years while insite has been operating we could have provided treatment to 5 000 addicts instead during that time 250 addicts have died of drug overdose alone
5359122 this is not to say that insite has no positive effect aside from supervised injections other medical services such as detoxification are offered at insite and i applaud them but as health minister i must ask is supervised injection the best that can be done for an impoverished and diseased community many of whom are also afflicted with mental illness

5359148 the passion demonstrated by the associates of rci to help provide the 2 700 children of christel house a better quality of life is both amazing and unprecedented
5359149 christel dehaan created an incredibly caring culture at rci many years ago based on honesty integrity sincerity and community service its a culture which is alive and well nearly 35 years later and its a culture im both honored and humbled to be associated with
5359150 there are not enough words to describe how im feeling
5359151 from day one rci has distinguished itself through its people this is a gift of love for which i am humbled and grateful

5359157 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
5359158 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
5359159 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
5359160 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
5359161 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
5359162 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
5359163 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
5359164 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
5359165 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
5359166 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
5359167 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
5359168 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
5359169 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

5359186 russia has invaded a sovereign state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
5359187 russia is so 20th century this century is all about preemptive strikes
5359188 the bottom line is that the united states is overextended militarily diplomatically and economically the united states is bogged down in iraq and afghanistan and needs russian support in the coming trial of strength with iran over its nuclear ambitions instead of speaking softly and wielding a big stick the american policeman has been loudly lecturing the rest of the world while waving an increasingly unimpressive baton
5359189 everything is what it is and not another thing cartoonish rhetoric only contributes to the dangerous return of what some conservatives seem to crave the other the enemy the us versus them of the cold war
5359190 even ordinary russians find it mightily trying to be lectured on questions of sovereignty and moral diplomacy by the west particularly the united states which even before iraq had a long history of foreign intervention overt and covert politics by other means after the exposure of the bush administrations behavior prior to the invasion of iraq and its unapologetic use of torture why would any leader much less putin respond to moral suasion from washington that is americas tragedy and the worlds

5359196 the cruciform sign overrides all ambiguity like the vision of constantine its presence signifies ultimate favor indeed the power to conquer
5359197 the references to crosses and oblations to piety and christianity which crowd the earlier pages virtually disappeared thereafter
5359198 theological grace appears but seconded by philosophical preeminence it is that preeminence that underwrites its superiority to european culture when it is compartmentalized in this way christianity become contingent rather than necessary

5359211 concealed in such data are answers to important questions such as what goes wrong in disease and what drug targets can lead to a cure
5359212 ultimately the rise of personal medicine will answer what is the best drug for a particular individual guided by an individuals unique dna code our role as computational biologists is to develop the methodologies to extract those answers currently hidden like a needle in the haystack of data
5359213 there are basically a lot of seemingly disparate complicated and different types of clues the answers are not written on the wall to get anywhere detectives have to take all these different clues and technologies and then learn how to put the complete puzzle together thats us were detectives
5359214 the new lab allows students from across different disciplines to interact and openly discuss their research each discipline biology computer science physics engineering chemistry and mathematics contributes tools and a particular way of thinking
5359215 interdisciplinary collaborative science will make our science better and advance quicker towards grand challenges such as a systems level understanding of how our cells work and even toward a cure for cancer
5359216 our role as computational biologists is to develop the methodologies to extract those answers currently hidden like a needle in the haystack of data
5359217 being able to perform unbiased analysis with these data sets allow you to rediscover things and by putting together and examining all of these data patterns you can figure out hidden variables of the cell how the gene expression is controlled for example and what the different regulators are
5359218 vast amounts of data are being produced in super exponential rates novel ground breaking technologies are being invented so much faster than the rate at which scientists can understand and leverage them to gain biological insights
5359219 its like buying a whole pie eating a tiny piece and throwing the rest away most of the data is only looked at on the very very surface and most of the data is only scarcely being used leaving the rest untouched

5359221 the album it has been finished for a while now i dont really know whats going on with it
5359222 the record industry is a very political place at the moment and i am on emi records lots of people have been fired or have taken redundancy recently as the company was taken over by a private equity firm called terra firma

5359224 it is significant in the sense that there was semtex in the explosive charge it did not go off but there was semtex there where it came from i dont know

5359235 it may be on the cusp of a major series of banking acquisitions on the west coast
5359236 the vacuum created in this market by the withdrawal of a number of major factors makes the west coast a fertile ground for creating a new large bank in this market

5359245 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5359246 repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5359247 its the first time ever that the bar has gone outside its own apparatus

5359252 i just had some tricks to catch him up and pull away a bit its just so much fun with these guys its just good fun

5359262 ive been contemplating the idea of giving up im looking at it as an option in various areas of my life youve heard the expression to drop the ball record companies are often accused of dropping the ball on a band or an album by refusing to promote it or to continue to put money into it what if i as my own ye olde record company decide to drop the ball on myself just something to think about

5359269 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5359270 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5359271 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5359272 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5359273 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5359274 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5359275 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5359276 what was really fun was because we were a college station there was no department there was no faculty moderator as long as we kept it clean we were all right
5359277 there was this guy who wandered into the station with a record he had called the power 18 that he was hoping to get around to various college stations and ours was an especially good one so he brought it around to us and we immediately put it on the air because we knew it was good and we broke it as an underground fm hit it was about rallying 18 year olds for the right to vote we were part of that movement to change the law it just went from there

5359287 my goal for the race was to be the first michelin rider home which is what i have achieved but things were too difficult to do better i started fully motivated and wanting to give the maximum and exploit fully the material at our disposal but today i cannot be satisfied with the result
5359288 i had difficulty with the front tyre and was forced to change my style of riding which meant not being able to exploit my speed in the corners i had to stop hard and fire the bike out of the corners rather than have a smoother style this difficulty penalised us in the race

5359292 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me
5359293 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions

5359303 there is no time to waste we want a better future we demand a better future we the american people are no longer asking
5359304 the free us ad takes a different tone than our previous efforts
5359305 this ad issues a direct and compelling challenge and juxtaposes the stark imagery of our addiction to fossil fuels with the earnest faces of the american people who are calling for answers and solutions now it takes the call for renewable energy from a request to a demand
5359306 the conventions are about coming together to choose the ideas and the people who will lead us forward
5359307 the next american president has the inescapable responsibility to move our country away from fossil fuels and toward clean sustainable energy sources our economic and environmental futures depend on it and the american people are demanding it

5359319 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
5359320 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

5359325 of course such pre emptive grovelling only encourages any zealot with a blog to demand even more censorship

5359327 we received in response from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment

5359342 plenty of recent media polls demonstrate that drilling for more american oil particularly offshore drilling has the potential to be a very effective wedge issue for republicans as a way to reduce the price of gas
5359343 for the immediate short term right now forcing house democrats to vote on drilling offshore and in wilderness areas or exposing their refusal to hold this vote would be a potentially strong wedge issue that would split the democrats win among independents and excite the republicans
5359344 the republican echo chamber has done a great job on this
5359345 this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very future of our nation
5359346 the energy crisis is real it is worldwide it is a clear and present danger to our nation these are the facts and we must face them
5359347 thou shalt not talk honestly to the american people about sacrifice
5359348 the ap conducted dozens of interviews and reviewed thousands of state and federal documents and found
5359349 1 since 2005 at the height of the housing boom more than two dozen states and u s territories have violated federal rules by failing to investigate and resolve complaints about appraisers within a year some complaints sat uninvestigated for as long as four years as a result hundreds of appraisers accused of wrongdoing remained in business
5359350 2 the only tool federal regulators have to force states into compliance is so draconian it would effectively halt all mortgage lending in a state that it has never been used
5359351 3 both state appraisal boards and the federal agency charged with overseeing them are chronically understaffed many with only one full time investigator to handle the hundreds of complaints that arrive each year some dont even have an investigator
5359352 the appraisal reforms of the late 1980s were good reforms
5359353 but they were not sufficient to prevent what we have seen because regulation without teeth is not regulation
5359354 it will never contribute more than a fraction of our needs
5359355 i think what were looking at is a tycoon team if you will people with the resources and vision for a new energy economy
5359356 its time for the wealthiest of the country to lead in solving the carbon crisis
5359357 if they can come together on climate change and pool their intellectual resources their financial resources and their own teams of people they have managing their empires what a critical mass that would be and what a voice it would be
5359358 this is a combination of a symposium and a renewable energy street fair and multimedia presentation
5359359 its a fabulous concentration most venues dont bring all of that together
5359360 our early start means were not facing the same compliance costs others in the sector are facing under the national greenhouse and energy reporting act
5359361 instead were focusing on the commercial opportunities for us rather than dealing with the compliance costs
5359362 were well positioned to make money from carbon markets which is simply an extension of our energy trading business
5359363 we have a solid understanding of the market and how to help our customers
5359364 the train has left the station on this and there will be severe repercussions for those who fail to see the inevitable coming
5359365 no one says its easy but carbon will have to be managed as just another business issue
5359366 we understood what it meant to measure our carbon footprint it was extremely difficult to get landlords to change their behaviour
5359367 we ended up spending the money ourselves to install sensors in offices change our light bulbs and employ our own cleaners so we could recycle
5359368 it was also a challenge convincing suppliers that we were serious about the carbon impact of production processes in our purchasing decisions
5359369 we made a conscious decision to pay more for more efficiently produced consumables and to include the long term carbon impact in equipment running costs
5359370 tnt has the largest fleet of diesel electric vehicles in australia we bought the whole production line from japan of 10 vehicles last year but we have 1500 trucks in our fleet
5359371 so its going to be some time before our suppliers can produce enough trucks to satisfy the demand
5359372 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
5359373 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
5359374 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
5359375 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect

5359379 the purpose of denver stories is to honor those individuals who have done the most for denver and i cant imagine anyone more interesting or exciting than jack
5359380 he was one of a kind a fellow hoosier and lived a life full and amazing
5359381 theres plenty of theater made by young people at the fringe most of it receives less attention than it deserves and some of it obviously aims to educate the performers as much as delight
5359382 heres a school show though from the denver school of the arts in colorado that pulls off the rare achievement of bringing 40 young people aged 14 17 on stage showing off some impressive performing skills and offering the audience a truly substantial and moving glimpse into the mind of the generation now trembling on the cusp of adulthood
5359383 over a brisk 70 minutes director shawn hanns young cast move through sketches based on
5359384 on top of that they have to deal with all the normal pains of adolescence from broken friendships to unrequited love their three minute
5359385 the content is terrific the staging excellent and the quality of performance truly moving and if these magnificent funny angry humble self aware kids speak for the whole of their generation then theres some hope for the future after all

5359387 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
5359388 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
5359389 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
5359390 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
5359391 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
5359392 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
5359393 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
5359394 tim wore his catholicism proudly he talked about it all the time
5359395 in fact russerts faith was not an elephant in the room it was the room it was the room he was raised in it was one of his great charms as was how he dealt with it in life and in our public discourse
5359396 catholicism was his base it was never his bias i think thats absolutely crucial and i will debate anyone who contends to the contrary
5359397 learnings from the political process for common ground in the catholic church
5359398 understood that the stakes were high he knew that better than most of us
5359399 he knew that the civility of our dialogue was under attack he knew that diversity in the public square takes work every day and he knew that our standards of journalism were being attacked
5359400 he understood what it meant to be called to be catholic and i think thats very important he took the call
5359401 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
5359402 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
5359403 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
5359404 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
5359405 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
5359406 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
5359407 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
5359408 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
5359409 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
5359410 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
5359411 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
5359412 do to others as you would have them do to you
5359413 how could they accuse of me of doing something wrong
5359414 if im not re elected our state will lose its influence
5359415 energy questions in the united states flow from the very fact that we have an energy policy in the first place
5359416 either the swimmers got it or they dont the suit will not win the race
5359417 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
5359418 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
5359419 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
5359420 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
5359421 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
5359422 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
5359423 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
5359424 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
5359425 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
5359426 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
5359427 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
5359428 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
5359429 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
5359430 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
5359431 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
5359432 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
5359433 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
5359434 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
5359435 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
5359436 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
5359437 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
5359438 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
5359439 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
5359440 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
5359441 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
5359442 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
5359443 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
5359444 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
5359445 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
5359446 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
5359447 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
5359448 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
5359449 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
5359450 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
5359451 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
5359452 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
5359453 the new york state education departments board of regents gave the nyu polytechnic merger its approval on june 24 at the boards meeting the final approval the deal needed to go forth nyu will now effectively own polytechnic university a brooklyn engineering school which will be renamed the polytechnic institute of new york university
5359454 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
5359455 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
5359456 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
5359457 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
5359458 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
5359459 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a 1 in 3 chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
5359460 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
5359461 its kind of a weird process if you stop and think about it
5359462 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
5359463 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
5359464 there is an urgency for youth to get involved with these things now more than ever to get involved and dedicate themselves to world issues to try to change the world
5359465 everyone brought welcome knowledge that was overwhelmingly encouraging and very informative
5359466 by yourself i find its hard to change but in a group you can come together and make one great event
5359467 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
5359468 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry

5359470 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son

5359472 it was thought that if youre getting to 16 17 or 18 youre getting to the end of your career dara has done a fantastic job in proving that you can continue to improve and that women can have children and get back into the sport she has gotten rid of a mythology in swimming that has been there for so long

5359485 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
5359486 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
5359487 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
5359488 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000

5359490 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
5359491 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
5359492 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
5359493 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
5359494 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
5359495 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
5359496 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
5359497 many in the christian right tend to get their information
5359498 the democrats talk of tolerance but in reality the only tolerance they ever exhibit is for their own intellectual arrogance and they dont have tolerance for my culture
5359499 they think were a bunch of hillbilly heathens who go out and burn crosses and do crazy bullshit
5359500 they dont give a f if were with them or not because it doesnt matter the f ing republicans have stolen the individual liberties thing and thats why the gun thing is such a big deal
5359501 i got a call from them right after johnny got out i never heard back
5359502 they have to be careful sometimes they remind me of another bunch from chicago the blues brothers they seem to think theyre on a mission from god
5359503 if thats how he runs his campaign he is going to lose id rather bet on those who voted before when he stands up and says that im gonna get 30 per cent more black voters im gonna get 30 per cent more of my people to turn out for me what is joe six pack thinking
5359504 he should say im a black guy im not gonna take the michael jackson treatment but the problems of south side chicago are the same problems of the appalachian mountains big sonsofabitches are kicking the little sonsofabitches in the ass now im one of the little sonsofabitches so im pissed off inside every rural republican is a rural democrat begging to get out but we always trip over our johnsons
5359505 think this election will be won on the internet but here at 5 30 in the afternoon they dont go on the goddamn internet they go watch the andy griffith show a 1960s sitcom
5359506 white people in the south and throughout the appalachians love black culture i mean southern style cooking is black food everything i eat is fried your swing vote in the appalachians comes down to common sense thinking people who have strong faith and what barack obama needs to do is embrace his culture because we like his culture but nobody knows anything about him over 10 per cent of the rednecks out here and im a redneck think hes a muslim cause nobodys ever told em any different
5359507 im pretty sure i aint a queer and ive never had queer thoughts

5359515 every four years you usually get to look at these guys try to go native think of president bush in his brush clearing outfit
5359516 but if youre president the day job does involve a suit and it can be awkward when youre not in work clothes
5359517 everyone knows how fast a picture can go from local novelty to worldwide laughingstock
5359518 it shows hes not trying to be like everyone else its part of the visual message that hes crafting in an odd little way it adds to the not pandering in a conservative middle america suit like a 50 year old tax lawyer wears
5359519 it would be inappropriate if mccain looked as stylish as obama he has a different physique hes a different age and hes much more conservative
5359520 he does have occasional fun with a wider flashy tie
5359521 not all senators can wear that but it looks right on him

5359546 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
5359547 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured

5359555 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
5359556 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves

5359568 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
5359569 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
5359570 por supuesto es algo especial estoy muy contento y realmente estoy esperando conducir delante de mis compatriotas en barcelona hicimos una carrera fuerte pero tuve que abandonar
5359571 espero que esta vez pueda tener un buen resultado dar lo m ximo
5359572 ciertamente continuamos mejorando lo que es muy alentador en hungr a mostramos que seguimos yendo para adelante y que podemos luchar duramente para finalizar cuartos en el mundial de constructores haber conseguido un buen resultado antes de la pausa veraniega hace que volvamos motivados para el resto del a o
5359573 trabajando duro durante los ltimos dos meses en la preparaci n de esta carrera
5359574 como nuevo circuito que es pienso que da una oportunidad a los pilotos de mostrar lo que pueden hacer nosotros debemos hacer lo mejor para encontrar m s r pido nuestros puntos de referencia y poder sorprender yo intentar hacer lo mejor para mejorar la puesta a punto con mis ingenieros y poder realizar una carrera fuerte
5359575 la sensaci n de velocidad dentro del habit culo es incre ble
5359576 it was the first time i profoundly thought over what getting married and married life really means
5359577 after that i was more ready to tie the knot and was totally sure i wanted to do it
5359578 thats how we survived because we needed it for the warmth to wash ourselves and to dry meat
5359579 the first time you jump into an ice cold lake your legs feel numb and you rush to the surface to get out as soon as possible
5359580 but afterwards its just wonderful you can feel the blood coursing through your veins
5359581 the peace you get immediately after that first shock is what makes you lie back and watch the world go by
5359582 while we were still arguing about modesty and the necessity of wearing swimsuits one of the finns took off his clothes opened a beer and just slipped into the sauna with a sigh of satisfaction
5359583 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
5359584 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
5359585 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
5359586 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
5359587 america uses a lot of oil thats 25 percent of the worlds oil demand used by just 4 percent of the world population
5359588 the simple truth is that cheap and easy oil is gone
5359589 i think i would be for al gore for energy czar in an obama administration
5359590 pickens is out to make billions of dollars for himself and to save the sierra clubs anti coal anti oil anti natural gas agenda
5359591 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
5359592 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
5359593 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
5359594 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
5359595 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
5359596 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
5359597 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
5359598 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
5359599 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
5359600 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5359601 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5359602 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
5359603 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
5359604 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
5359605 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
5359606 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
5359607 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
5359608 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
5359609 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
5359610 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
5359611 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
5359612 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
5359613 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
5359614 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
5359615 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
5359616 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
5359617 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
5359618 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
5359619 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5359620 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
5359621 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
5359622 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
5359623 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
5359624 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
5359625 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
5359626 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
5359627 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
5359628 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
5359629 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
5359630 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
5359631 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
5359632 we love the american people its the policies of your government we dont like
5359633 the prophets endure and can only be ignored at the risk of our own despair

5359641 its a good thing that i checked my big backpack in the first place because i would have had to check it now anyway
5359642 i entered into a life and death contract at the time
5359643 i studied politics and should have known what these sorts of agreements are worth
5359644 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
5359645 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
5359646 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
5359647 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
5359648 what do we have to give up to reach the cost of a trillion and a half to three trillion dollars theres going to have to be some pain some sacrifice on the part of the american taxpayer isnt there
5359649 the real way to bring gasoline prices down is not by going back to try more of the same things that have not worked in the past but to say wait a minute now is the time for a really dramatic shift over to renewable energy
5359650 he did not force gore to debate a crackpot from cloud cuckoo land who is still waiting for the evidence to arrive about human sources of radical climate change

5359662 it was only to be expected then that ayaan would leave the social democrats and join the free enterprise party the vvd delighted to have a beautiful black critic of the welfare state and muslim radicalism in a party that was over all very male and very white she was welcomed as a walking statue of liberty in fact she was too radical for the vvd too the leaders of this party hate nothing more than rocking the boat and that is precisely what ayaan was aiming to do she was always more of an activist than a politician and the compromises and deals of politicians were not for her like van gogh she wanted to stir things up her real ambition was to be the voltaire of islam to attack the faith

5359667 opposes the present us policy in iraq not on the basis of any principled opposition to neo colonialism or aggressive war but rather on the grounds that the iraq war is a mistaken deployment of power that fails to advance the global strategic interests of american imperialism
5359668 theres not that much difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage

5359671 these days an appreciable number of obama supporters are starting to use words like disillusionment but thats a consequence of projecting their political outlooks onto the candidate in the first place the best way to avoid becoming disillusioned is to not have illusions in the first place

5359674 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
5359675 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
5359676 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
5359677 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
5359678 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
5359679 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
5359680 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
5359681 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
5359682 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
5359683 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
5359684 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
5359685 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
5359686 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
5359687 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world

5359694 in the past maybe there wasnt a strong enough deterrent for carrying knives
5359695 it is not always the person intending to hurt someone who gets injured people carrying the knives also get hurt
5359696 boredom can set in a lot of times there is a lot of peer pressure and then something happens that everyone regrets
5359697 young people need to understand that carrying a knife just like carrying a gun is dangerous and wrong
5359698 but government and the police cant solve this problem by themselves we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models

5359773 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective
5359774 prevents any major hostile actions we believe the dolans may be trying to head off a public war of words in the media
5359775 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
5359776 will continue to do work with them and support their networks
5359777 i remember him telling me back in the day that if you wanted to know real estate youve got to hang out with real estate investors if you wanted to know sports youve got to hang out with athletes i wanted to know tv so i hung out with bob and learned the tv game from one of the best in the business
5359778 we believe tv content can be positive and responsible and still have good ratings with great content
5359779 a digital broadcast would only penetrate about 40 of german households
5359780 that in itself would be enough to discount the idea of sufficient consumer participation
5359781 puts it on track to its most successful year in history
5359782 if anyone can transcend the limited shelf life of olympians its phelps
5359783 its always been an impediment to these folks going on because the glory is supposed to be enough
5359784 once upon a time studios would find these beautiful creatures and put them in movies
5359785 and if someone isnt that facile with the english language like weissmuller well you just make him tarzan
5359786 the key is to create content that keeps him out there
5359787 the challenge for olympic athletes has always been to be able after the post game hype to translate that into big marketing and endorsement deal dollars
5359788 theres no question that michael is an important driver of interest in the olympics
5359789 but the olympics turn out to be more than michael phelps
5359790 any idea of what your kid is doing right now
5359791 mike i have no problem with introducing my daily consumable products to people and having repeat product ordering we have a system in place to make this simple everyone loves the products most of those who come on board for the business no matter how much support i and my upline give give up if theyre not making a living in 12months theyre over it i have tried in various ways to encourage them however duplicating myself just doesnt happen why
5359792 an idealized almost comic book quality a caricature of sweetness and light
5359793 if things continue to go as badly as they are at this moment their muslims alienation could turn against the fabrics of europes most established democracies
5359794 whether it is headscarves or gender specific separation of public space
5359795 political islam is trying to establish apartheid of the sexes in free european societies a muslim hospital is fundamentally different from a catholic hospital in islamic hospitals the husbands decide whether a caesarian will be carried out or whether their wives may have themselves sterilised after bearing four children
5359796 stalinism could be criticized but communism had to be handled with kid gloves
5359797 today a fundamentalist wave is bearing down on europe there is no reason why islam as soon as it enters the occidental democratic sphere should escape secularism and enjoy a favor that is denied other confessions
5359798 it accords the same treatment to all communities but not to the people who form them limiting their freedom to liberate themselves from their own traditions they are thus denied what has always been our privilege passing from one world to another from tradition to modernity from blind obedience to rational democracy
5359799 in politics as in philosophy the equal sign is always an abdication
5359800 if you want to feel guilty feel guilty that you didnt bring john stuart mill and left us only with the koran
5359801 exactly the kind of muslim we should be engaging with
5359802 to protect the muslim identity and religious practice to recognize the western constitutional structure to become involved as a citizen at the social level and to live with true loyalty to the country to which one belongs
5359803 to be citizens even though they are still treated as aliens
5359804 ramadans values were neither secular nor always liberal but they are not part of a holy war against democracy either his politics are an alternative to violence which in the end is reason enough to engage with him critically but without fear
5359805 founded the modern vogue for suicide terror and its cult of death as a political art form and attached this cult to islam
5359806 qutbs most important supporter in the world of egyptian intellectuals
5359807 he must have arrived at the conclusion that in the times magazine it was good to ask the question about sayyid qutb but bad to answer the question
5359808 issued the most famous of the fatwas authorizing suicide terrorism by the palestinians
5359809 which is that the stoning of women yes the stoning is a bit shocking but we should simply declare a moratorium and then think about it to decide if it is good but thats monstrous
5359810 what i say in my own position is that the law is not applicable but today i speak to muslims around the world and i take part even in the united states in the muslim world
5359811 the seventh century had suddenly appeared poking out from beneath the modern rhetoric of feminism and rights
5359812 i see no difference between the neo cons and the neo left
5359813 the problem with neo cons and neo leftists is that any disagreement with their idol is taken to be a hostile attack
5359814 to assume that we are reliving 1938 and to put our trust in military invasion as the best way to defend ourselves is a dangerous form of hysteria
5359815 the need to defend europe against alien threats the fatigued self doubting weak kneed intellectuals

5359828 sweetheart you are more than an extra it takes every single person to make a great movie thank you
5359829 the most important item youll find in your kit is our contact information during the convention wed love to speak with you about the benefits of coal based electricity to a sound energy platform
5359830 romantic love is mental illness but its a pleasurable one its a drug it distorts reality and thats the point of it it would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw
5359831 wie viele messies menschen mit ordnungsproblemen und aufr um defiziten aller art sich hierzulande tummeln
5359832 it was unpleasant id have lacerations on my body from my shorts being so tight theyd yell cut and people would come over with a bathrobe because i was so embarrassed about the flab rolling over it was so ugly that and my double chin
5359833 the characters fashion sense is really horrific im wearing a lot of bright clothes and i dont wear anything except black and white in real life im wearing orange and blue together its horrible and wedge flip flops all the time toe rings and an anklet i have long hair too so i have these horrifying extensions and these long nails its so embarrassing
5359834 ive lost the weight but its difficult to get it off as you get older
5359835 im not going to lie to you i do have some concern that because the books are over the anticipation wont be the same
5359836 it would be a complete car crash if no one showed up
5359837 i get the thing well mr eastwood is so well beloved and this may have ramifications at academy time
5359838 but its over i said what i had to say he believes what he believes and thats that
5359839 ive bought a couple of those houses already that hes building you can build a house for 150 000 gbp75 000 which is amazing so i bought two of them and plan on buying more as theyre doing an amazing thing there
5359840 there is a tendency to make fun of people who get involved in these sorts of things brad went there builds houses he can do a lot of other things with his time he and angie really put their money where their mouth is im always very impressed by them
5359841 this is just incorrect i was never his agent or manager
5359842 theyre trying to take my salary and say i was the agent i wasnt
5359843 he has made gratuitous ridiculous and outrageous statements about his former clients mr krutonog was fired more than two years ago after he refused to work on the series
5359844 i would like to make some things clear regarding dr burton sultan and his fictitious allegations and hunger for publicity that has dragged my father sir sean connery into a media circus
5359845 sean connery has no ownership in my apartment in new york city he is my guest when he visits and barely spends two weeks there in any given year
5359846 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting divorced in the first place
5359847 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
5359848 i lose more balls than anyone on the course because i wont go in the rough to get them there are snakes everywhere and they give me the willies
5359849 we decided we didnt want publicity we wanted to get married just between ourselves and our children and the judge who is an old friend of the family
5359850 i realised that i hear about these secret celebrity marriages the day after they happen and i dont think anybody is really trying to have a truly secret marriage but most of the fans and most of the media dont even know that im married
5359851 it can be a total secret theres no reason why the helicopters have to show up we were originally gonna do it on a public beach some place until we found out you have to register to do that and get a permit so immediately theyd call up the media and the paparazzi would be showing up
5359852 thats why we ended up doing it in michaels private backyard he lives at the beach and we were barefoot in the water it was a gorgeous day
5359853 its your birthday so lets be kind shall we and after all theres much worse actresses out there than madonna
5359854 this is such a fun film id even go so far as to say madonna was great in this
5359855 madonna isnt trying to stretch herself here shes merely playing herself a sassy chick from brooklyn whos all about boys and bonking
5359856 madonna is actually quite good in the film though its a flick that requires a bit of patience
5359857 it was one of those nights when i wore a supertight dress that you couldnt have worn anything under since it would have showed
5359858 the paparazzi were literally lowering their cameras like speculums when i got out of the car
5359859 on the way home i said to my husband len wiseman darling i think they might have gotten it and so when we pulled in at home i made him re enact the thing with his camera a sort of crime scene run through
5359860 she saw me wearing them and she was like you know those are drews i dont care he broke them in and they fit me perfectly
5359861 lisaraye her cousin phillip travis and her publicist lynn jetter assaulted the guard at the premiers home proceeded to ransack the house and then assaulted the premier and his sister the premier at no time had any physical contact with lisaraye
5359862 an attempt was made by and on behalf of my husband to first prevent my entry into our home and then later to make me leave our home by force i shall continue to assist the police force with its inquiries
5359863 no we didnt break in she was at her home someone bit her it mightve been michael or his sister but there was shoving and someone bit her on the shoulder
5359864 he kissed me on the lips and then he gave me a filterless cigarette
5359865 i came over all light headed and had to sit on his dressing room steps maybe it was the cigarette and nothing to do with the legend
5359866 it made me feel a little embarrassed to be honest it made me a little sad it hurt my feelings
5359867 i am in a pretty good workout regimen that i like so it inspired me to keep it up the energy level and the way i feel now is great
5359868 she told me they said some rude mean things but thats not why i wanted to change
5359869 we are just enjoying being engaged and being with each other we feel that when the time is right we will know it
5359870 i said hey bernard how are you and i kissed his forehead
5359871 he shrugged his shoulders like im tired and i said i know youre tired later on that night it took a turn for the worse
5359872 the doctor came in and i said hes gone isnt he and she said yes
5359873 there is a bit of russian in all of us
5359874 the advertising campaign concept was based on the fact that the actor has russian roots
5359875 since she is not interested i highly doubt that she will give a nominator the permission to do so
5359876 she madonna wanted it for a while but she couldnt bring herself to spend that much money on a watch
5359877 its your birthday so lets be kind shall we and after all theres much worse actresses out there than madonna
5359878 this is such a fun film id even go so far as to say madonna was great in this
5359879 madonna isnt trying to stretch herself here shes merely playing herself a sassy chick from brooklyn whos all about boys and bonking
5359880 madonna is actually quite good in the film though its a flick that requires a bit of patience
5359881 there are peacocks wandering around and beautiful girls and oddly placed bottles of baby oil
5359882 i checked out the grotto but i didnt go in theres the old addage you might get pregnant
5359883 when i was 12 and had crushes on guys id put my first name with their last name but it never sounded right rumer depp nope in school kids would sing rumer rumer with a big hairy tumour
5359884 i loved it and i still love them they are an amazing organisation i still keep in touch with my manager from when i was 14 they are just great to me
5359885 i wanted to have a quinceanera 15th birthday party so i went to wendys to work to pay for my own quinceanera i stayed
5359886 i paid for my cheerleading and everything through that it was like whatever you want to do outside of school you have to pay for it i never had a car because i was always trying to save
5359887 it was very emotional ive done a few things in my life and hes starting out in his and its probably bigger than anything that ive achieved
5359888 this lad is going to protect our country so im very proud of him
5359889 i would like to clarify that we are honoured that he cruise will continue as our full partner in control of ua he is in the middle of one of the greatest careers our industry has ever seen and one that will continue at the top of united artists entertainment
5359890 were space pirates think of johnny depp as a romulan
5359891 it still amazes me that people actually watching me with a gun didnt just burst out laughing
5359892 i cant even play ping pong but it turns out im good with weapons ive got enormous hands like a transsexual and thats probably why
5359893 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night how could this happen
5359894 i just kept saying this is too weird and leo was like oh get over it and im going yeah a little reminder youre my best friend hes my husband this is a bit weird
5359895 i hadnt realised how much my chemistry with him since titanic would still stick its great to discover we can just slip right into it like muscle memory
5359896 we knew that if we were going to do something again it had to be something big and emotional i played this very clever cat and mouse game to get my husband and then my best friend involved
5359897 i feel like i found my perfect fit shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
5359898 ive got to make it home to catch the swimming
5359899 first person who didnt make men look silly for wearing a full body bathing suit
5359900 tiens regardons un peu les stars qui sont envisag s pour jouer les m chants du prochain batman philip seymour hoffman et johnny depp houl que a sent bon et si en plus il y a le sphinx merci pour linfo
5359901 never is the generation gap bigger than when parents and kids debate about what car to buy
5359902 it doesnt have to be hard though parents can get what they want and kids can too
5359903 convincing customers to drive long distances to shop for furniture has become increasingly difficult as these purchases are now made closer to home
5359904 finger stores performed well in big box environments for decades however smaller stores located in multi tenant developments closer to our customers are more inline with what our customers are asking us for
5359905 the announcement will have a devastating effect on those older people already struggling to pay their energy bills and is likely to drag well over a million more into financial hardship around 2 4 million pensioner households are currently spending more than 10 percent of their income on fuel bills and a 40 percent increase in energy bills will mean that millions of older people will be facing even higher bills than before and having to make the unenviable choice between whether they can eat or heat
5359906 for every 1 percent increase in bills a further 40 000 older people fall into fuel poverty and every year well over 20 000 die from the cold its time the government intervened to prevent the energy companies making profits at the expense of vulnerable pensioners raised the winter fuel allowance to 400 and regulated social tariffs to give proper discounts to older customers
5359907 workers are the victims of inflation not its cause the government must act to help those unable to cope our case for a windfall tax on the greedy oil companies and the utilities companies is unarguable its time to stop dithering and start acting
5359908 edf is a perfect example where this french company is limited under law from raising fuel prices in france but edf can hit british families with massive increases
5359909 the government needs to do more for the uk housing market by reducing or removing stamp duty and they should kickstart house building by announcing a massive increase in new council houses
5359910 these are the bold moves which would show the electorate the government is listening and is prepared to act these measures would go along way towards reconnecting labour with its core voters
5359911 certainly if i am obliged to bring religion into after dinner toasts which indeed does not seem quite the thing i shall drink to the pope if you please still to conscience first and to the pope afterwards
5359912 slowly the governing bodies have learnt how best to use the money coming their way and it is important to remember this is all about sporting development no one is getting rich on this rebecca adlington the double gold medal winning swimmer earns 12 000 a year from the lottery and still seeks a hand out from her dad
5359913 the department for culture media and sport predicted ahead of the games that the
5359914 a good chance of its best performance in a non boycotted olympics since antwerp in 1920
5359915 at the same time as helping pay for athletes the lottery was also helping to pay for a new influx of foreign coaching talent the introduction of improved scientific training methods exemplified by the cycling team and advanced sports medicine also had a major impact and britain showed sydney was no fluke by finished 10th again with nine golds
5359916 when these games are over we will have a debate cum bloodbath on how much energy and money have been spent on an olympic team that has hogged the footnotes here it will be small picture short term stuff needles drawn at dawn by pygmies show me the medals guff from a country that confuses an ole ole ole tradition with a sporting culture
5359917 the only british athlete to have won gold in two different sports
5359918 while we were slow dancing my crush and i had our first kiss
5359919 in the last few years the market for personal loans has been extremely competitive as lenders and borrowers alike cashed in on the availability of cheap credit increased competition pushed prices down and lenders continually undercut each other in order to top best buy tables
5359920 this is extremely bad news for consumers who may be considering consolidating existing debts to try to drive down their monthly expenditure
5359921 our quarterly economic forecast highlights a significant worsening in uk economic prospects there is now a distinct possibility of technical recession the level of uk unemployment is likely to increase to nearly 300 000 over the next few years reaching almost two million an increase above two million cannot be ruled out
5359922 our view is that the threats to growth are more serious and more immediate than the risks of higher inflation
5359923 the uk economy urgently needs an interest rate cut to counter threats of recession
5359924 whilst a marked slowdown in activity is likely over the next 18 months even if interest rates are cut when inflation peaks the correct policy decisions are still needed to ward off the threats of a serious and prolonged recession the longer the mpc waits before cutting rates the bigger the danger that the economic situation would deteriorate
5359925 the worlds most famous store faces a very expensive strike our members keep harrods running they ensure the lights stay on the building operates safely and shoppers can get about the store it is difficult to imagine how the shop could function properly without them
5359926 it is very worrying that those workers who were not given two extra days holidays are in a recognised union while the shop floor workers who got the extra leave do not have a recognised union
5359927 commitment to tackle terrorism to promote dialogue with india especially over kashmir and to root out corruption
5359928 the announcement by president musharraf that he is standing down as president brings to a close a critical period in pakistans history and its relations with the uk and other countries
5359929 pakistan is a vital friend of the uk and it is essential for britains security never mind the personal ties that bind nearly one million british people to pakistan that it has a strong and democratic government with a clear mandate and programme for thorough going reform of its social political and economic structures
5359930 the uk will remain strongly committed to its partnership with the pakistani people notably through our aid programme we will also continue to deepen our security co operation with the new government
5359931 it is with great sorrow that we must announce this brave soldiers death as we offer our sympathies to this soldiers loved ones
5359932 it is being widely reported that the mid air collision at coventry on 17th august involved a microlight aircraft
5359933 irrespective of aircraft type i would like to offer the condolences of all the bmaa membership to the families and friends of the pilots and passengers of the two aircraft
5359934 i am proud that they have taken the initiative to support this important programme
5359935 once youre overseas you can just go from country to country we know that some of the most high risk offenders do that
5359936 not wanting to bail me out of jail for involuntary manslaughter at 4am
5359937 this was a tragic incident a family member can never be replaced and it is always painful when civilians particularly women and children are involved
5359938 the taliban use tactics in which they cause civilian life to be at risk they the taliban have no regard for the afghan people and support for the taliban in helmand is reducing
5359939 right now im having fun im not too old yet
5359940 the branding of it was fantastic and the idea of it all being five presenters and being positive for kids and learning through music was so good
5359941 but i never ever thought it would get to a point where i would look back on doing it for 10 years
5359942 kids are very honest and they love to hear music
5359943 they can grab onto different things and enjoy it without having that critical side of them which is one of the reasons hi 5 has lasted so long
5359944 we have a huge adult following who dont actually have kids
5359945 thats what hi 5 did 10 years ago it set a bench mark and took kids television to another level
5359946 maybe theres an appeal in that way but also the music is not nursery rhyme it actually has a top 40 essence to it but the lyrics are for kids
5359947 they set the benchmark way before we did and helped us get to where we are
5359948 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
5359949 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
5359950 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
5359951 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
5359952 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
5359953 your talent got you here but only your choices will keep you here
5359954 fellas what can i talk about that will hold your interest obviously im not doing a good job so you tell me what i can discuss that will be more interesting that what youre talking about during my presentation
5359955 christian music always seemed like the special olympics of music
5359956 der preis den wir f r den frieden zahlen m ssen
5359957 christian music always seemed like the special olympics of music
5359958 this life is not so much a time for getting and accumulating as it is a time for giving and becoming
5359959 a nurturing attitude is a critical asset in the building of a community and for every generation a necessary habit of the heart
5359960 lets give him a chance and see if he can do it
5359961 if we vote in keadilan there will be malays in the party unlike mca
5359962 i must salute them the bn isnt well prepared at all this time i called them up for information on arif shahs whereabouts and they told me to call them back at 1am can you imagine that
5359963 all this while he said he had them now suddenly they are with me how come
5359964 if he has evidence ask him to make a police report
5359965 i have nothing against him but he represents umno and racial politics
5359966 i think its very important that the market should function
5359967 im a lifelong republican by the way but next time around hillary here i come im a protest vote
5359968 someone get us a popular local band within this particular price range
5359969 aplicando el art culo 111 de la ley de defensa de las personas para el acceso a los bienes y servicios
5359970 aqu se puso de manifiesto la impunidad y el encubrimiento con la utilizaci n de todos los aparatos del estado
5359971 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
5359972 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
5359973 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
5359974 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
5359975 the surgery went as planned and annie is now recuperating at home annie would like to send her thanks and appreciation to all that have sent their well wishes in the past few days

5359979 annie lennox has undergone spinal surgery to release an impinged nerve
5359980 i came back to the u k and got wheeled off the plane
5359981 a first i must say felt a bit like elizabeth taylor got an mri scan this morning and am now sitting up in bed with my left foot like a dead fish freezing and numb im going to have to get myself a crutch and a parrot so i can fob myself off as a pirate and scare the neighborhood preschoolers just kidding folks
5359982 were raw in some positions but it was a good test
5359983 we saw what we need to work on and what we did well

5359986 grant me o lord my god a mind to know you a heart to seek you wisdom to find you conduct pleasing to you faithful perseverance in waiting for you and a hope of finally embracing you
5359987 thats way out of proportion for even the dramatically unpopular infoworld contributing editor whose company devil mountain software developed the windows sentinel tool and analyzes the exo
5359988 most of us girls we have to stop our sport so we can start a family but for her to have a family and still get back in and win the silver medal is just absolutely incredible
5359989 so nervous that he looked like he put his lips in a box of white powdered donuts
5359990 the one thing thats been different about this job and the jobs previous for me
5359991 has been that i havent succumbed to that feeling like youre behind theres always a feeling like youre behind there is always a sense of urgency like ive got to do this or were going to fall behind on that guy recruit were going to fall behind on this guy
5359992 and i havent succumbed to that doing something that i havent thought out and made sure that we do it the right way at the end of the day there is time what there isnt time to do is go back and fix mistakes that were made in haste
5359993 you dont want anybody to see you sweat but you always have the sense that im behind and ive got to catch up
5359994 at the end i was trying to decide if i was going to princeton or ucla
5359995 and i had really made up my mind i was going to princeton because i hadnt heard from ucla and now that im on this side of the fence i understand why i hadnt heard i wasnt that important
5359996 but i got a phone call like four days before the bruins were going to start camp and terry says are you going to be there
5359997 so he said it again and it was like hooking the big bass just reeling him in
5359998 hes one of the first guys i met when i came to ucla he was a walk on it was so funny early on he came on without a freshman like presence he basically took over the scout team he was taking shots from guys in practice and he would keep fighting
5359999 i called home 50 straight nights telling my dad i wanted to come home id made a mistake
