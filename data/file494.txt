4940023 if youre already familiar with php for database backed web applications youre probably also familiar with lamp oreillys acronym for the hugely popular linux apache mysql php stack of software
4940024 but its an essay from the ever interesting tim oreilly that brings together the cloud and the future of open source and some of his
4940025 for those not familiar with vector linux its a decade old distribution based on slackware that provides many of the user friendly
4940026 everyone recognised the ecks final figures were imperfect the question was how imperfect were they
4940027 had the election been rigged or did the discrepancies noted by odm and more impartial observers reflect a deliberate attempt to inflate the presidents votes and or reduce mr odingas

4940029 this service is keeping citizens involved and could help us prevent another crime the crime map has been a big help in raising awareness in the area this addition to our web site is really getting citizens involved
4940030 those types of calls mean the site is working like it should
4940031 i was really intrigued to see a robbery two tenths of a mile from my home the only thing is that i would like to see a bit more information but i know there are issues with privacy and ongoing investigations
4940032 it is nice to have this right at my fingertips
4940033 with one click i can look at what is happening within a 5 mile radius of home or office
4940034 all the information that our community needs is right here
4940035 this helps promote our vision to help people keep their eyes open for problems in our neighborhood
4940036 if i can keep everybody informed through this service it will really help
4940037 we are testing this with a lot of other jurisdictions and will evaluate it after a year
4940038 for now we see it as a big improvement over what the local media has been able to get out about crime in our area it really is keeping citizens involved in fighting crime
4940039 when you commit to something the hard work that you put in you want the prize at the end and theyve identified the prize
4940040 im not a betting guy but i would put down everything on this team winning
4940041 we shot 45percent from the three and we shot close to 80 percent from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that

4940046 tudor hall is a place that makes history come alive for people
4940047 for one thing people often ask if tudor hall is haunted then there are many people who have come to the house and gone or passed away who carried a love of tudor hall with them
4940048 as interest in the property grows its important to give tours with the most updated information
4940049 many people cant see beyond john wilkes booths assassination of president abraham lincoln
4940050 but there is so much more to it than just that one aspect
4940051 when you think a person is on drugs you look for eye dilation and heavy breathing
4940052 they also tense up their muscles to try to make them look bigger
4940053 we want the kids who go through the program to finish the program and be better leaders and people and have good character
4940054 theres not a day that goes by that we arent charging a juvenile with something
4940055 weve always dealt with this problem from the back side
4940056 its time to deal with it on the front end this society does not invest what it should in its children in the areas of abuse and poverty kids need positive role models early on in life before its too late to save them
4940057 we cover one of the largest areas in the county as far as geography goes
4940058 there is no room for parking and no room to expand thats the main reason we are moving we just lack space the expansion is long overdue
4940059 it will offer ample space for equipment and parking and will suffice for many years down the road
4940060 we havent even advertised the building and we have people waiting in the wings to buy it
4940061 it has four bay areas for trucks and also has office space i am sure it will suit someones needs and help us pay for the other building
4940062 democrats and republicans alike are adept at making decisions without letting the facts get in the way a new study shows
4940063 unless you get off to a really hot start you kind of feel like youre behind the 8 ball
4940064 sometimes you can start pressing too much and in golf pressings not really good to do youve got to let the birdies happen let the putts go in you cant really force them in i think its easy to get agitated the day after you made everything
4940065 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4940066 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4940067 the position of the malays after the 12th general election
4940068 i cannot foresee the country without umno the malays only know umno and its allies i cannot imagine how the malays will behave or react without umno on the scene
4940069 it would have been different if umno didnt behave like that even if people had opted to go the multi racial make up of the pkr for instance they might have won some seats but not to the extent of what they are enjoying now
4940070 to bring about unity in all aspects of government policies programmes and even to the ngos and the political institutions that should also be the primary concern of everybody
4940071 this is where i learned to love the peasant the indigenous people and to admire their efforts to excel despite adverse conditions
4940072 the hope is that my children will find work and learn a trade to meet their expenses
4940073 lugo has good intentions but i dont know if hell be able to fulfill his promises in five years
4940074 the situation is putting everyone under a lot of pressure
4940075 a lot of people consider tengku razaleigh as a has been but dont forget he was in the opposition for nearly 10 years so he has the experience of fighting from the outside he was finance minister for a long time so he understands the economy and i think of all the umno leaders he actually gets it because he is talking about real change he thinks it should appeal to all malaysians rather than just malays he can be a formidable opponent
4940076 our party is no longer democratic we have lost our sense of mission and struggle the umno culture has become sycophantic and fearful dominated from above our highest value is now money
4940077 ku li is still facing obstacles on the ground party members are being stopped from attending his functions but if branches pass resolutions giving him their support the division chiefs will have no choice but to allow their members to debate the resolution and consider nominating ku li
4940078 and a word of warning those who do anything to physically alter the way franky looks amp that are obvious on camera are dead fricken meat u guys will be paying our photography amp video bills for the wedding and im serious for real

4940087 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
4940088 muerte ceremonial en la agon a de rasu iti de jos mar a arguedas
4940089 most life expanding possibilities imaginable can be found in the lives that we already have and the mother lode of these possibilities lies in the unexplored depths of our long term intimate relationships
4940090 reject the societal message that we are all entitled to perfect bodies great sex and endless romance
4940091 a habitual nightly glass of wine can be a way of avoiding the very things you most need to deal with
4940092 dont assume that you are more responsible for what is good in your lives than your partner the same goes for what is bad in the relationship be suspicious whenever you feel that troubles are more your partners fault than your own

4940094 i feel ezam can help attract young people to umno because he is an influential politican
4940095 umno can use ezam if he is truly sincere in wanting to strive for the party
4940096 i feel that despite tun dr mahathir mohamad having left umno he still has umno at heart and his criticism in the past was made in the interest of umno and the country
4940097 thats not correct i am offering myself to contest the post of president to help rejuvenate an unsettled situation in the country not because pak lah abdullah wants to step down or otherwise

4940102 cardiovascularly i felt comfortable but my legs had gone my calf went first then it went up the entire leg and it felt like i was running on one leg
4940103 but i didnt do all that work for nothing its just really frustrating
4940104 i was going to the finish line no matter what i did all the hard work and it feels frustrating because cardiovascularly i dont feel like ive run
4940105 i tried to to the right things in the race tried to go after constantina but my legs werent there
4940106 i didnt feel sick or in distress but there was nothing else i could do
4940107 fingers crossed for 2012 look at constantina maybe i can do that in 2012 if my body holds up i know in london ill have all that support
4940108 given the turmoil in the traditional media industries and the large number of layoffs particularly in the daily newspaper segment

4940110 well make the decision to press the button on the online packages only when readers are able to pick up the inquirer on their doorstep or on the newsstand
4940111 it keeps them from talking about just about anything but their own belly lint and even that would be ruled out if we all found out tomorrow that a new form of aids is spread through belly lint
4940112 we tell people its a fantasy festival so come in your renaissance or fantasy gear
4940113 its not a must but id say 15 or 20 percent come dressed
4940114 some visitors are just curious they dont know what this is all about i tell them its a little like a ren renaissance fair but just a little ren fairs dont have people dressed in costume like fairies
4940115 how about a pity sale im a grown man for petes sake

4940117 my wife is the artistic director or something with the fair and she shanghaied me
4940118 i said you guys want to dress up and they were down in the basement getting their stuff
4940119 they come to bow or curtsy to a queen of the fairy court
4940120 this is my first fairy fest i didnt really know how to dress
4940121 i sort of googled male fairies and got all kinds of hits
4940122 from what i could tell its much like a renaissance or medieval festival and it smells good soaps and patchouli
4940123 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
4940124 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself

4940134 you have to give it to him im not going to say hes the epitome of a sprinter there are many different kinds of sprinters
4940135 a lot of people believe you had to be short and stocky to be a sprinter

4940143 there are about 450 000 mexican nationals in our jurisdiction so we are always moving in order to bring them services
4940144 we want to educate people that there are options when someone dies
4940145 people will often cremate someone here or bury them thinking they cant afford to send them back to mexico but it can be inexpensive with help from the consulate
4940146 there are salesmen and bean counters those who plan the party and those who are the life of the party
4940147 the accounting books and computers we obtained could help with clarifying the case
4940148 inspire women to be beautiful in their own skin and still attract attention when they enter a room
4940149 since it is fundamentalist christian ministers who have been shouting to the american people that they must choose between religion and science it seemed reasonable to have thousands upon thousands of christian clergy assert otherwise
4940150 it simply wouldnt be very persuasive to have leaders of other religions saying to christians that christian fundamentalist ministers are not speaking for all christians
4940151 the clergy letter project and evolution sunday are not designed to change the minds of fundamentalists rather our goal is to educate the vast majority of christians who if told they have to choose between religion and modern science are likely to opt for religion

4940156 the photos were taken between about 8 10pm and 10 15pm and they show that the time lines made by gerry mccann and another tapas 7 friend are wrong they are dynamite

4940166 a contradiction to what the lebanese groups including syrias ally have agreed on and that is to define the property of the land in order to return it through diplomatic means but we want to remain positive and hope this is a fresh start at the level of relations with damascus
4940167 there isnt even a road to this place pregnant women have to deliver in their homes and if they have complications they die
4940168 we just want to build houses and cement is cheaper here
4940169 smuggling of arms happens in areas very known to the state and it doesnt happen on small roads like this it happens on large roads in front of everybody

4940177 what they delivered does not include the criteria we are interested in
4940178 based on the past six years of experience the city administration is skeptical the leonardo can deliver a reliable program and succeed in the long run
4940179 mayor beckers actions show a lack of consideration for voters who approved a 10 million bond specifically for the leonardo in 2003 and for the generous donors who have contributed millions of dollars to build the project at library square we urge him to reconsider and allow the leonardo to have a fair hearing on tuesday
4940180 i was delighted to learn of this very viable alternative to the more expensive scheme
4940181 there is nothing firm in terms of how they would finance getting there
4940182 is mayor becker contemplating a use for the building that would be of greater benefit to our city
4940183 the purpose of this is to get utah to have fair minded representatives and have the voices of the citizens heard on any level and at every level
4940184 i am looking to become authentic stand up for my beliefs and to show the society that i live in that they believe in these things as well
4940185 being a sea of blue compared to an enormous state of red
4940186 thats not happening in ogden salt lake city is the bubble and we need to expand it or burst it
4940187 we want them to be plugged in door to door and not just be volunteers but leaders in the campaign
4940188 how anyone bounces back from a big setback or disappointment depends on their level of resilience
4940189 parents have the power to promote a great deal of resilience in their kids and parents have the power to stand in the way of their children developing resilience
4940190 some of us are more nervous by virtue of birth some of us are sturdier and hardier but above and beyond a quality at birth resilience is learned and developed through practice
4940191 resilience is developed through the practice of facing and coping with adversity
4940192 adversity is part and parcel of every part of a childs life
4940193 say a daughter comes home from school upset because she didnt get the lead in the school play
4940194 mom sees shes upset and says lets go to the mall lets go shopping youll feel better shes hoping to cut short the moments of upset and disappointment the moments of adversity
4940195 its planting the seeds of someone who uses things to feel good
4940196 acknowledge the feelings say i see how upset you are tell me about it and then leave it be
4940197 allow the daughter to sit with the sadness and the disappointment whether it takes 15 minutes or two hours and discover that the feelings will go away and she will in fact survive those feelings just fine maybe shell take out a book or write in her diary or call a friend which are all healthy mechanisms she can learn to rely on
4940198 more and more parents are cruising their childrens lives looking to thwart anyone or anything that might get in the way of their childs happiness
4940199 i just want my kids to be happy why you shouldnt say it why you shouldnt think it what you should embrace instead
4940200 we need to give our kids empathy in their moments of pain
4940201 its the most fun you can have with your clothes on
4940202 the best thing is the joy it gives you and along with it the physical strength
4940203 it teaches you some discipline to concentrate to be aware of whats going on at the moment youre doing it
4940204 that when i heard of club med being very very open to new ideas i approached them
4940205 i never thought i had the potential to learn something new at this age and i do
4940206 i got afraid i was hesitant to jump off the board but i did theres exhilaration but also fear
4940207 i was just praying he was going to catch me
4940208 i think its because of my father being a merchant ship captain amp while i was growing up i always ended up with something thats related to the sea like while i was working in langkawi in 1999 worked in that island for a very long time
4940209 i want people to understand that i am friendly i get so tired of the negativity of people who do not understand deaf blindness sometimes i do explode
4940210 some drivers are wonderful but some have an attitude problem
4940211 the driver doesnt understand that people on the bus who can see or hear know what is going on but for a deaf blind person we never know what is happening ahead
4940212 but i also tell our drivers that i know where richard mcgann is coming from deaf blindness is the most isolating situation it is frustrating
4940213 its a very small population but with a tremendous need of services
4940214 as someone who is totally deaf and blind richard is even more rare many people who are deaf blind have some vision or hearing
4940215 people dont understand the situation they think ok youre blind but you can hear well no i cant
4940216 people always assume it is unfair that money doesnt grow on trees
4940217 but it is not fair for them to say that we are expensive people this hurts a lot
4940218 helen keller said that people who are deaf blind are the loneliest people on earth
4940219 blindness cuts us off from things but deafness cuts us off from people
4940220 the biggest problem for people who are deaf blind is lack of understanding
4940221 communication is a challenge with great potential for misunderstanding patience is also an issue you have to take time to do what they need but the world moves so fast and people dont have time then theres fear just like there is about most disabilities
4940222 the camps primary purpose is to help deaf youth open up to the truth of gods existence and gift of life in our world
4940223 when looking back i realized that my goal and vision were quite evolutionary in nature
4940224 i did not become a priest with a specific goal of establishing camp mark seven it just evolved out of encountering various experiences and challenges in the field of deaf ministry
4940225 i became a priest in a religious order in 1977 and i discovered how hard it was for a deaf person like me to be mainstreamed in a religious community that does not use sign language as the primary language
4940226 it was a very difficult and challenging period of my life and it led me to decide to try to establish a religious community
4940227 deaf people prefer to have a signing priest as opposed to a sign language interpreter in any sunday mass celebration
4940228 the reason for this is that the deaf people can relate more closely with the holy sacrifice of mass by looking at and celebrating with the priest however deaf people do accept sign language interpreters if there are no other choices
4940229 when i attend mass with fr coughlin its coming right from him its not going through an intermediary which would be an interpreter
4940230 you can lose meaning depending on the skill level of the interpreter too
4940231 you dont see the disability if someone is in a wheelchair its very obvious with deaf people its not
4940232 it is never easy to be deaf especially when you have to learn to live and compete in this hearing world
4940233 today in our religious community the dominican missionaries for the deaf apostolate our seminarians both deaf and hearing do not feel that they are out on the limb
4940234 they feel they are part of the whole family this is the essence of religious life living together as one family with one mind one heart
4940235 we depend 100 percent on donations as we do not receive any direct funding from the church or government
4940236 this is one of the greatest challenges we face in our struggle to maintain our religious community
4940237 ali sina adalah murtadin iran yang memelopori website faithfreedom org bersama sama dengan murtadin2 lainnya seperti ibn warraq sina adalah ujung tombak gerakan murtadin pertama dalam sejarah islam hal ini dimungkinkan terjadi dalam sepuluh sampai lima belas tahun terakhir karena imigrasi muslim ke tanah barat dan perkembangan teknologi internet tidak berlebihan untuk mengatakan jika orang2 seperti ali sina ibn warraq dan wafa sultan selamat dari ancaman mati bagi yang meninggalkan islam maka islam tidak akan tampak sama lagi

4940368 ill lose in the preseason as long we have the regular seasons weve had the last couple of years but its going to be a better plane ride than it would be if we lost
4940369 i dont think you can take winning for granted in this league
4940370 things we did wrong can be corrected guys fought hard so i think its something we can build on
4940371 we didnt get that consistency because of the long runs were giving up
4940372 but i think were getting there guys are learning how we do things theyre getting to the sidelines communicating with our defensive coordinator and getting things ironed out
4940373 the biggest thing we take from tonight is we didnt let them get into the end zone
4940374 when they get into the red zone youve got to prevent them from getting touchdowns and keep the game in striking distance we came up with a victory
4940375 right now its preseason its really a test were trying to see what happens thats really a scenario that can happen during the regular season where we give up a long play let them get down in the red zone and we have to bounce back and recover from that play and stop them
4940376 we did that i look at it like thats a scenario we went through we did a good job it happened we learned from it we have to watch the tape and well learn from it guys will come back
4940377 it was the kind of night where we could be happy about a lot of individual performances especially from some of our younger guys
4940378 we still didnt get the sharpness we were looking for from our first units offensively and defensively offensively were still having a little trouble in the red zone punching the ball in when we get down there defensively we had some breakdowns and screwups on the run game early
4940379 we did keep them out of the end zone and forced five turnovers we kicked very well and covered well there were some things to build on
4940380 the big thing is we just have to be a lot sharper with our first offense and defense
4940381 ill just play my own game and not think too much because i have a four shot lead and i have a lot of room to play good
4940382 yeah i feel more pressure going into today but this is my second time so its not the same nerves and not as much pressure as last time this time i feel very good i feel ready to win
4940383 all i can do today is my best and try to enjoy the golf and enjoy the weather hopefully after no 18 ill have a big smile
4940384 i was thinking of how proud i was to be canadian
4940385 in order that the salvation of souls in these parishes suffers no more harm
4940386 the elephants and pianos were all on my shoulders my heart was pounding and my stomach gone its a long way if youre feeling like that
4940387 i knew the 36 hours in between would be a race to recover and i did everything i could but in the end it was really telling on me
4940388 it was really tough and i knew that before i came here i would have liked to have gone quicker but ive got to recover for the 10k
4940389 that will be a different challenge and a tough test and im looking forward to it
4940390 i had expectations for the 400m freestyle but this is a great surprise
4940391 i felt good in the first 400m of this race and at the 800m and 900m i started believing that i could win
4940392 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100m to save my energy and attack in the final 50m
4940393 im not sure im a little older now ill see what i feel like have a break then see what happens
4940394 to get second is great but three in a row would have been nice
4940395 i have certainly no regrets in my preparation and what ive been able to do here it was certainly a good race

4940403 25 8 dat voorzien is voor april 2004 zal onder andere ook in japan en in de verenigde staten worden verdeeld
4940404 maar eigenlijk is het toch wel een heel specifiek genre en chantal pattyn of jan van biesen wilden het dan ook liever niet zelf doen zij vonden dat het iemand moest zijn die daar echt mee bezig was n die ook nog een beetje nederlands kon praten want we hebben hier in vlaanderen wel rap groepen zoals t hof van commerce maar dat is in het dialect en die jongens spr ken ook gewoon dialect het was dus niet verantwoord om die op de vrt los te laten bij mij viel de schade nog mee ook al werd ik toch naar een logopedist gestuurd want de norm ligt daar toch wel erg hoog samen met dj lefto stefaan lallemand stel ik dus dat programma op maandagavond van 9 tot 11 helemaal zelf samen en presenteer het ook
4940405 twee jaar daarvoor verzorgde ik ook al een programma op de studentenradio urgent maar dat is van een heel andere orde dat is vrijwilligerswerk je doet dan ook volledig je eigen zin er is daar geen taalredactie of controle dat is dus helemaal iets anders dan bij de vrt daar komt heel veel bij kijken waaraan je niet hebt gedacht nogal wat administratie bijvoorbeeld toch heb ik het voorstel aanvaard omdat het heel belangrijk is voor mensen die met die muziek bezig zijn dat er eindelijk iets kwam
4940406 the hop verschilt ook wel van de andere programmas bij studio brussel die worden telkens gemaakt door een samensteller een technicus en een presentator bij ons is er ook wel een technicus aanwezig maar lefto draait de platen zelf omdat er ook soms gescratched wordt scratchen is typisch voor hiphop zeer simpel gezegd betekent het de plaat met de hand ritmisch heen en weer bewegen onder de naald we spreken dan wel over vinylplaten ook al probeert men nu met cds ook wel iets te doen dat daarop lijkt
4940407 hiphop is in oorsprong een zwarte muziekvorm die ongeveer 25 jaar geleden is ontstaan in twee wijken in new york harlem en the bronx puur als reactie van jongeren die eigenlijk totaal geen uitweg hadden om zich te ontspannen culturele centra bestaan daar uiteraard niet en de fuiven in de discotheken zijn te duur voor hen daarom brengen ze gewoon hun favoriete muziek op straat twee platendraaiers en een bak platen zijn voldoende en omdat het zo primitief is volstaat het gewoon stroom af te tappen van verlichtingspalen dat leidde dan meteen tot de eerste contacten met de ordediensten omdat de elektriciteitsfirmas dat niet zo leuk vonden
4940408 in oorsprong speelde men funk soul kortom alle zwarte dansmuziek van die tijd behalve dan disco wat op dat moment erg populair was in die dure discotheken er was ook altijd wel iemand bij die de platenbakken hielp dragen en die stelde dan ook de dj voor bovendien vermeldde hij ook door de micro dat iemand die aan het dansen was die dag toevallig jarig was of zo na verloop van tijd begon hier en daar iemand dat wat beter voor te bereiden en die werd dan een echte animator in het jargon mc master of ceremonies ze zetten hun aankondigingen op rijm bijvoorbeeld en gooiden die dan tussen de muziek door op een moment dat er alleen maar drums te horen zijn of zo en op die manier is dan het rappen ontstaan
4940409 parallel daarmee heb je ook nog de breakdancers en graffitispuiters die eveneens op die feesten afkwamen zodat de dj de rapper de breakdancer en de graffiti artiest als de vier elementen van de hiphopcultuur worden beschouwd zelf ben ik daar nu al meer dan tien jaar in ge nteresseerd omdat ik gefascineerd ben door het samengaan van twee vrij elementaire zaken ritme en rijm iets wat iedereen kan eigenlijk vandaar ook dat de teksten zoveel impact hebben en dat sommige rappers het medium dan ook gebruiken om een politieke boodschap te brengen maar in principe kun je over alles rappen er zijn er bijvoorbeeld ook die nummers hebben gemaakt over hun sportschoenen om maar iets te zeggen of dat ze graag pizza eten maar vooral in het begin was de boodschap op de eerste plaats coke snuiven zoveel mogelijk vrouwen versieren en in een dure auto rijden puur escapisme puur materialistisch ook ook nu zitten we daar weer een beetje in want zoals bij alles doet zich ook hier een slingerbeweging voor bovendien was het vroeger meer een kunstvorm een vorm van zelfexpressie terwijl het nu eerder big business is geworden
4940410 er zijn nu ook blanke rappers wat op zich niet verwonderlijk is aangezien ik zelf al gezegd heb dat eigenlijk iedereen het kan je hebt dan natuurlijk puristen die zeggen enkel zwarten uit die wijken uit new york zijn echte rappers zelfs die uit los angeles rappen op een totaal andere manier dat is ook normaal het weer is daar anders het is een totaal andere cultuur een andere mentaliteit in de wijken maar dat is natuurlijk een discussie die al zo oud is als de blues can white men play the blues en ik denk dat die vraag al lang beantwoord is door de feiten maar waarvan je je wel bewust moet zijn is van de roots van die muziek die kun je niet wegcijferen
4940411 de bekendste rapper van het moment is zelfs een blanke namelijk eminem in het hiphop milieu was hij al bekend als mc want voor zijn enorme hit stan had hij al twee platen gemaakt technisch is hij heel goed het enige probleem is dat hij heel duidelijk zijn profiel waarmee hij naar buiten komt aan de markt heeft getoetst in de zin van als we zon nummers maken dan verkoopt het en dan heb ik het dus vooral over het shockeren volgens mij heeft hij met andere woorden meer talent dan wat hij tot nu toe laat zien
4940412 dat shockeren is op een bepaalde manier wel specifiek voor de hiphop wat je in andere genres niet hebt is battles tussen twee groepen of twee artiesten bijvoorbeeld bij mc battles krijgen de rappers elk om beurten een minuut en dat gedurende drie rondes waarbij men probeert het publiek op zijn hand te krijgen het spreekt vanzelf dat als je aan zoiets wil beginnen dat je een ego moet hebben je moet van jezelf vinden dat je de beste bent en dat je met iedereen de vloer kan aanvegen maar heel veel van wat er tijdens zon battle gezegd wordt is dan ook puur fictie eigenlijk probeert men zo po tisch mogelijk elkaar beledigingen naar het hoofd te slingeren als je dat letterlijk zou nemen dan zou je tot de bevinding komen wat is dat voor een gestoord iemand maar dat moet je nu juist niet doen als arnold schwarzenegger in een film twintig mensen vermoordt moet je dat ook niet ernstig nemen dat is ook maar een rol vandaar dat je ook niet moet denken dat die twee op het podium mekaar zullen vermoorden integendeel na afloop schudden die elkaar de hand want er is heel veel wederzijds respect wat ik in rock veel minder zie gebeuren daar is zeker evenveel afgunst als in jazz of in klassieke muziek
4940413 hier in belgi is de hiphop scene uiteraard een mengeling er zitten nogal wat mensen van za rese afkomst tussen en verder palestijnen marokkanen turken en natuurlijk ook gewone vlamingen die aangetrokken zijn door de muziek bij de rappers heb je meer een gemengde groep bij de djs zijn het eerder vlamingen de muziek is op zich krachtig genoeg om mensen te overhalen zonder dat de sociale situatie daarbij belangrijk moet zijn want uiteindelijk gaat het om verhalen vertellen en dat staat los van welke sociale achtergrond ook het verhaal van iemand die opgroeit in een wijk met veel miserie zal uiteraard anders zijn dan dat van iemand die nooit materi le problemen heeft gekend maar dat wil daarom niet zeggen dat het niet k n
4940414 t is wel een mannenwereld dat wel ik denk dat er in belgi bijvoorbeeld geen enkele vrouwelijke dj is en ook in de ons omringende landen en in de verenigde staten zelf zijn er heel weinig voor graffiti ken ik ook niemand in belgi of ik zou me zwaar moeten vergissen breakdancers zijn er een paar maar ook niet veel zoals o a bleek uit de bbc uitzending met ballerina deborah bull rds idem voor de rappers maar het blijft een ongelooflijke minderheid misschien heeft het te maken met dat ego en ook met het feit dat je er helemaal alleen voor staat met enkel maar een microfoon om je achter te verschuilen en misschien ook gewoon met het feit dat jongens in de puberteit graag met elkaar optrekken de sfeer van jongens onder elkaar maar dat heb je ook in rock
4940415 nee hoor mc light is al meer dan twee decennia heel capabel bezig ik moet wel toegeven dat vrouwelijke mcs ook een mannelijke stijl aankleven nogal hard uit de hoek komen en zo ja het is nu eenmaal een mannenwereld ook nogal homofoob bijvoorbeeld sommigen beweren dat dit ingebakken zit in de zwarte cultuur en inderdaad bij jamaicanen is dat bijvoorbeeld wel het geval maar volgens mij heeft het meer met die egos te maken de schrik voor het anders zijn en zoals altijd bestaan er precies als reactie daarop militante homoseksuele rappers
4940416 als je vanaf negen uur s morgens open bent tot s nachts n uur dan werk je zestien uur per dag dat kan volstaan zeker
4940417 de meeste mensen komen rond vijf zes uur thuis en hebben dan nog tot een uur of tien de tijd om een pintje te komen drinken want s anderendaags moeten ze opnieuw gaan werken in het weekend ligt dat misschien wel enigszins anders maar ook dan heb ik geen klanten die lastig doen wanneer ik om n uur de deuren sluit dat is een gewoonte geworden laat ik het zo zeggen ik ben daar ook zeer consequent in of ik nu nog met n klant zit of met twintig
4940418 wij zijn normaal gesproken open tot vijf uur halfzes het uitgaansleven komt hier immers maar om tien elf uur s avonds op gang en als we geen alkohol meer zouden mogen schenken dat zou al evenzeer een streep door onze rekening zijn en nochtans wat is het nut van zon maatregel de studenten zitten hier allemaal in de buurt op kot die rijden dus niet met de auto
4940419 als je ziet dat ze genoeg hebben dan zou ik zeker geen alcohol meer bestellen
4940420 maar om dat nu in een wet te gieten ikzelf ben niet de eigenaar van dit caf ik werk hier gewoon als ik dan tot n uur heb gewerkt dan zou ik nauwelijks nog iets mogen drinken na mijn dagtaak dat is toch belachelijk
4940421 wie gaat dat controleren zeker nu het alcoholvrij bier stilaan ingang begint te vinden dan geef je toch iemand een gewone pils in een glas van alcoholvrij bier zeker
4940422 anderzijds is het hier in gent mode geworden om slechts rond middernacht of zelfs n uur te beginnen uitgaan als de jonge mensen dus hun gewoonten niet veranderen en die wet er zou komen dan mogen wij de zaak gewoon sluiten zo simpel is dat maar als iedereen om acht uur zou beginnen uitgaan en om n uur weer terug naar huis zodanig dat wij om twee uur kunnen sluiten dan zijn wij daarmee perfekt tevreden vandaar ook dat ik die maatregel om geen alcohol meer te schenken na twee uur maar een domme maatregel vind niemand gaat immers nog uitgaan als men niet mag drinken en de jeugdkategorie die men er precies mee viseert die drinkt n al minder alcohol wij verkopen meer cola dan bier en de meisjes drinken vittel voor de lijn
4940423 dat is alweer voorbij sedert twee drie jaar zitten we duidelijk weer in een krisisperiode de jeugd geeft niet zoveel geld meer uit als een paar jaar geleden
4940424 dat is natuurlijk zeer streekgebonden in de dorpen bestaat dat niet maar in de grootsteden is dat erg in antwerpen en brussel gaat men zelfs nog l ter uit dan in gent en hoe dat komt kijk discotheken zijn duur geworden men moet betalen om binnen te mogen de drankjes zijn duur ik heb dus de indruk dat men zich vooraf thuis of in de bioscoop een beetje opwarmt nee het zijn zeker niet de jongeren die veel drinken wij hebben ook nog een caf en daar komt een ouder publiek laten we zeggen tussen 25 en 40 en die drinken zeer veel al is ook dat zeer streekgebonden want vroeger hadden wij een dancing in waregem toevallig zijn we daar vorige week nog eens geweest en daar wordt er dus w l heel veel gedronken en dat komt omdat waregem in een rijkere streek ligt daar wonen veel meer zelfstandigen en zakenlui hun kinderen beschikken dan ook over veel meer geld
4940425 meer vittel dan bier en gij gelooft dat misschien zegt men dat omdat men speciaal reclame wil maken voor vittel ik zou eerder zeggen integendeel het lijkt me toch logischer dat er in de stad meer wordt gedronken dan op de buiten aangezien de verplaatsing veel kleiner is
4940426 ik kom pas van een vergadering met de voornaamste discotheken uit oost vlaanderen uiteraard zijn wij daar tegen en niet enkel uit eigen winstbejag want als ieder n moet sluiten dan geldt dit natuurlijk ook voor de concurrentie maar denk eens even na als om twee uur de deuren dichtgaan dan staat iedereen op straat en gaat dat een chaos van jewelste geven bij ons zijn dat b v zes zevenhonderd autos men mag gerust veronderstellen dat de jongeren dan drank hebben meegebracht zodat ze blijven hangen in garages of weet ik veel zodanig dat de omwonenden veel meer last hebben van nachtlawaai bij ons gedragen de meesten zich kalm want wie al dronken is mag er niet in en wie dronken wordt die bieden we gratis koffie aan ik denk dus dat dit voorstel ontsproten is uit de geest van iemand die in de belangstelling wil komen maar die verder niet heeft nagedacht over wat dit nu eigenlijk allemaal inhoudt wat gaat er b v gebeuren met trouwfeesten of met het bal van de burgemeester en dergelijke toestanden en heeft hij ook al eens nagedacht of er geen verband bestaat tussen het feit dat zon sluitingsuur in engeland wel van kracht is en dat dit juist het land is van de hooligans daar is men het immers gewoon om overal drank mee naartoe te nemen en ze drinken ook sneller want geeft men jongeren een bepaalde som mee om uit te gaan dan doen die dat geld sowieso op als het dus op een kortere tijdsspanne moet dan gaat men gewoon sneller drinken ofwel heeft men flessen drank gekocht men neemt wat meisjes mee en men trekt ermee naar de garage of naar het huis van iemand wiens ouders niet thuis zijn het gevolg gaat dus juist het omgekeerde zijn van wat men beoogt
4940427 luister ik heb voor de kerstperiode vijf bussen gehuurd van de buurtspoorwegen zodat de krypton bus kan rondrijden in oudenaarde brakel wetteren enz de mensen worden opgehaald en krijgen met hun ticket zelfs een consumptie gratis dat kost me ongeveer een half miljoen dat heb ik ervoor over op zich heb ik dus ook niets tegen zon maatregel maar wie gaat dat controleren en hoe men gaat tien keer meer politie nodig hebben het zal erop gaan lijken alsof de avondklok is ingesteld
4940428 och het interesseert me niet meer we gaan alleen af en toe nog eens snookeren
4940429 nee hoegenaamd niet hij drinkt nooit als hij met de auto rijdt
4940430 het opleggen van een sluitingsuur gaat de drankgewoonten bij sommige jongeren zeker niet veranderen men zal eventueel vroeger beginnen drinken maar men zal het er zeker niet voor laten de factor gezelligheid speelt immers een doorslaggevende rol daarom dat ik ook tegenstander ben van die maatregel om geen alcohol meer te schenken vanaf een bepaald uur tenslotte rijdt niet iedereen die uitgaat met de wagen en daarbij als men met de auto rijdt mag men geen alkohol drinken punt uit of dat nu voor twee uur is of na twee uur dat maakt toch niks uit men zou dan ook veel eerder aan een betere rijopleiding moeten werken dat kan dan misschien door de leeftijd te verlagen zoals dat in de verenigde staten het geval is maar de discipline zou tegelijk ook moeten verhogen en dat kan dan in de hand worden gewerkt door meer controles in de buurten waar er veel uitgaansmogelijkheden zijn en een betere organisatie van het openbaar vervoer zou natuurlijk ook al een hele stap vooruit zijn
4940431 ik ga wel degelijk weg met de wagen maar vooraf maak ik met mijn vrouw een afspraak wie er die avond gaat rijden en als ik alleen ga dan matig ik wel mijn drinken al denk ik wel dat ik dan teveel drink volgens de offici le normen
4940432 wie aan het stuur zit drinkt in het begin van de avond misschien twee pintjes maar nadien schakelt hij over op niet alcoholische dranken
4940433 wie toch wil drinken die zal dan naar een priv club gaan
4940434 een tweede vaststelling is dat delinquentie eigenlijk tot het normale gedrag van de jongeren behoort 266 jongens en meisjes van de 399 gaven immers ronduit toe n delict te hebben gepleegd moest hetzelfde onderzoek jaren geleden zijn uitgevoerd dan zouden we dezelfde resultaten gekregen hebben de jeugddelinquentie is immers in vergelijking met vroeger weinig of niet gestegen w l het aantal interventies of het aantal jonge mensen dat wordt voorgeleid d t is duidelijk een symptoom van onze tijd
4940435 waarom doe je dat en hoe ziet het met de crisis
4940436 in doornik is een veertiger zaterdagochtend rond 07 15 uur neergestoken de twee verdachten zijn opgepakt toen de man twee jongeren kruiste en hen boos aankeek haalde een van hen een mes boven en stak hij het slachtoffer neer de man werd opgenomen in het ziekenhuis en verkeerde in levensgevaar intussen is het gevaar geweken voor het slachtoffer de twee verdachten twee jongeren uit doornik werden opgepakt
4940437 prima gedaan kerel want jij bent voor mij een symbool van
4940438 jongeren zijn niet de rijkdom van morgen zoals men wel eens zegt ze zijn enkel wat ze nu zijn het is dan ook ons aller opdracht de jongeren terug in de maatschappij te brengen
4940439 de universiteit is altijd al een belangrijk maatschappelijk instituut geweest niet de elite die men ervan heeft gemaakt
4940440 mijn voorbereidend gesprek met prof apostel was al drie dagen congres waard
4940441 alle instituties die met jongeren te maken hebben hanteren het traditionele historisch gegroeide beeld van het kind binnen het gezin
4940442 gelukkig hebben we al de alternatieve opvoeding gekend in de jaren zestig zodat we nu weten dat we het niet op die manier doen
4940443 unless they are in the rare 403 b that has low cost investment options they should probably get out
4940444 besides costs your options are the whole world in an individual retirement account versus the limited choices in the 403 b third you can typically get more sophisticated with beneficiary designations in an ira than you can with a 403 b
4940445 the older you are the less advantageous the conversion becomes because the math works against you later in life
4940446 but my hunch is these people need to live on this and so you can make an argument for converting some of it now particularly if you believe tax rates are going higher in the future
4940447 msnbc com breaking news americans love law suits for breakfast
4940448 msnbc com breaking news abortion made illegal in new york
4940449 because we analyze large volumes of spam we were able to identify the point where this campaign switched from cnn to msnbc and provide compelling evidence that the attack is from the same source
4940450 from the msnbc perspective the problem is that anyone who subscribes to their alerts will receive a bogus e mail whose format is exactly the same as a legitimate msnbc alert depending on your e mail program you can float your mouse over the url and find out where the message originated but if you have a program like outlook that is not possible
4940451 we really had to spell it out for the state
4940452 they check everything we had to do proof of title and they did their own research to make sure our home was free and clear of any liens it took us five weeks to get the states approval
4940453 keep in mind youre still paying the mortgage on that house
4940454 understand how long your home is going to be off the market if the raffle doesnt sell enough tickets that could be 120 days or more
4940455 taxpayers must also report the fair market value of merchandise or products won as a prize or award as taxable income
4940456 in general winnings from lotteries and raffles are considered gambling winnings
4940457 when we were speaking to people in the real estate profession we were told that you could probably get a second mortgage or equity loan on the spot to cover your taxes
4940458 people who are faced with credit card debt are unwilling to face their financial issues and therefore may be leaving them unresolved
4940459 americans have not stopped going out to eat and arent going to stop but they are being forced to decide
4940460 their discretionary income pool is smaller so if a restaurant isnt on their personal a or b list they will drop it
4940461 the restaurant industry is overstored especially in casual dining with demand nowhere near the increased supply of stores over the past five years
4940462 the companies could get the money so they opened up the stores
4940463 these stocks are very very very cheap because their fundamentals keep getting a little worse
4940464 but if you have a time horizon of two or more years at some point theyre going to have a big big recovery
4940465 we could be close to a bottom for the restaurant stocks though the businesses themselves will continue to have a tough time the rest of this year and into 2009
4940466 yet a lot of the higher quality companies with strong brands balance sheets and management teams will survive and be well positioned when the economy turns around
4940467 many of the independent restaurants which are locally owned and operated have managed to do just fine in the current environment
4940468 they arent big and dont have a lot of marketing muscle but they are able to compete with the things they can control like service and commitment to customer satisfaction
4940469 the integration of ukrainian elements of missile early warning and space control systems with those of foreign countries that are interested in gathering space data
4940470 could prevent any actions like those which occurred on 7 8 august at first in south ossetia and then in other regions of georgia
4940471 we want freedom indians go home and kashmir is ours
4940472 theres an immediate need to bring all parties to a common consensus to take the country forward
4940473 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal
4940474 under prachandas leadership the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4940475 prachanda said the new government will be forming economic policies based on suggestions by business people and industrialists
4940476 he also said there would be no curtailing of profits and that the party is eager to work with the private sector
4940477 weve lots of challenges ahead of us but we also have a whole new spirit to confront them
4940478 you know i have never been accused of being a racist in my life and im feeling it lately and i dont know where that is coming from im just supporting a candidate im trying to see fairness in a process i thought i believed in
4940479 no es dif cil nadar r pido cuando tienes un equipo tan incre ble detr s de ti

4940481 ha estado llena de altibajos ha sido una gran monta a rusa
4940482 tenemos una historia sensacional en esta prueba desde atenas pero sta es la primera vez que he formado parte y tomar la delantera ha sido un gran honor
4940483 el actor al que nadie culpa pero que es el mayor responsable son los europeos
4940484 desde la independencia de kosovo dijimos que los rusos responder an y que probablemente lo har an en georgia y osetia
4940485 los europeos occidentales no han entendido los cambios de rusia en los ltimos cinco a os la ue m s que cualquier otra entidad es responsable por los sucesos en georgia insisti en la soluci n para kosovo y no escuch a los rusos
4940486 estados unidos necesita la ayuda de rusia en ir n
4940487 los europeos no pueden mantener el equilibrio de poder en eurasia
4940488 no damos garant as a los georgianos nos oponemos la pol tica americana de dar garant as arreglaos
4940489 hey how you going to celebrate this years mothers day

4940491 our people cant get out with their transmissions either it is in a very bad deep area if you know it down here
4940492 wed be able to pass on this wealth of skills this wealth of knowledge to our child in a much better way than we might be able to because we dont have the skills to pass that on verbally
4940493 surely its best for society and for the child itself to have the ability to hear from hearing fire alarms and walking across the road safely to appreciating the music of beethoven and mozart its better to be able to hear
4940494 i have a deaf couple living next door to me they had twins the girl was deaf the boy had slightly impaired hearing when the twins were teenagers they had major problems with the boy because he resented bitterly being surrounded by the deaf community as a result he went off the rails and only just missed out on going to prison i know that they resented having a hearing child and wish that he had been deaf as well
4940495 since the birth of our profoundly deaf granddaughter nearly 4 years ago weve experienced at first hand an almost tribal like mentality amongst a significant proportion of the deaf community digital hearing aids and cochlear implants are eschewed as unnatural interference and those that use the advances that medical research has to offer are regarded as somehow impure by all means celebrate individual differences but not to the extent that it breeds an arrogance and a contempt for those deaf people who choose gratefully to accept technological means of leading a more integrated role in society
4940496 surely its best for society and for the child itself to have the ability to hear from hearing fire alarms and walking across the road safely to appreciating the music of beethoven and mozart its better to be able to hear
4940497 my government is not in danger i am confident of its survival i hope a middle path can be found out to resolve jmms grievance

4940502 there have been several landslides including one about one mile from the spelga dam on the slievemaman road in newcastle co down
4940503 there were severe flash floods last year that seemed to affect pockets but this hit all of northern ireland
4940504 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4940505 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4940506 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4940507 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4940508 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4940509 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4940510 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4940519 the routine of a small desolate village can rule its inhabitants lives more effectively than an imperial dynasty
4940520 hillsides had been flattened supermarkets had been built roads had been laid through the sweet potato fields
4940521 without trust without a shared vocabulary without community we feel endangered
4940522 spawned an enduring shift in the ways society viewed mores and manners relations between races and genders rights and duties
4940523 dramatically altered the pace of daily life wildly expanded everyday access to information and media and transformed our business errands entertainment gossip health care time wasting sports news and socializing
4940524 we have used our affluence and abundance to build screens and false idols that obscure what matters most what is authentic we miss the seeds of happiness which are simple people and useful connections to people
4940525 i t is necessary to find and nurture authentic commitments in private and community life
4940526 in making thoughtful choices it is necessary to cultivate a guiding moral temperament a philosophic perspective
4940527 the challenge hamdan v rumsfeld and the fight over presidential power
4940528 to drown out the sound of his children he listened to his ipod
4940529 and never suspect that whole continents of experience are there just behind those ordinary faces best to be old yourself to understand
4940530 and were pleased with ourselves because weve kept out of a war but if you ask me i think a war would do us all the good in the world were soft and rotten like a pear thats gone past its best
4940531 did someone cut down the old mawonga tree was it really old did it fall down these trees are studded among the lower growing trees of the highveld they are taller than the other trees whitish trunked
4940532 how beautiful it is and how easily it can be broken
4940533 expresses the surface vivacity of life with the underlying strain of immutable and inexpressible sorrow when you look at a piece of delicately spun glass you think of two things how beautiful it is and how easily it can be broken both of these ideas should be woven into the recurring tune
4940534 look at me look how clever and subtle i am
4940535 i suppose that one reason that this haunting line struck me with such force when i first came across it is that it acknowledges with perfect simplicity the inevitable entwining of beauty and tragedy that is the hallmark of the greek theater and is a consistent element in the works that have always moved me the most from the plays of euripides to the history of thucydides from the light comedies of no l coward to the films of pedro almod var as the greeks knew well its the potential for being broken which boils down to the knowledge that we all must die that gives resonance and meaning to the small part of the universe that is our life
4940536 an eye to a career in academia instead i became a journalist
4940537 t he astringent beauties of the classical languages the hard and unyielding grammars the uncompromising demands of syntax and exigencies of meter none of which admit of either shoddiness or approximation
4940538 the serious critic after all is measured and judged as much by what and how he praises as by what and how he blames and he should be as stimulated by the pleasure he gets from his reading as he is by the pain
4940539 how beautiful it is and how easily it can be broken
4940540 i handle outreach to a lot of official republican groups and make sure they will be taken care of when they get here
4940541 organizations like the republican governors association the national republican senatorial committee the national republican congressional committee
4940542 then we also handle a lot of the affiliated groups like the veterans groups
4940543 we make sure they have their credentials hotel rooms and other things they need
4940544 we first lived in little rock and then my dad did his residency at uab in birmingham and then set up practice in tuscaloosa when i was in the third grade
4940545 i got involved in politics when i went to auburn where i was a political science major
4940546 when i graduated i went to do an internship in 2001 in washington with sen richard shelby who is also from tuscaloosa
4940547 i was working with the nrcc and the nrsc and we raised like 30 million and picked up a lot of seats in congress
4940548 then one of my old bosses got me back into politics helping to prepare for the 04 convention which was in new york and went on to help plan the inauguration
4940549 i took about a year to do all the studying and go through all the paperwork to prepare for my test which i took in 2005
4940550 in my day to day job i do not use my spanish that much
4940551 but it comes in handy from time to time when i deal with spanish speaking constituents
4940552 i wouldnt say im an old pro at this but i definitely know my way around better this time than last time
4940553 is like putting together a fortune 500 company and then within three weeks totally dismantling it

4940565 in the past they werent medicating anyone and i saw the pain that people was going through trying to detox and kick off the methadone which was worse than kicking heroin
4940566 i am really tired of allowing myself to keep coming to prison with a dope habit trying to kick it i made a step to get into a methadone program and i dont want to lose it
4940567 whats unique is giving methadone treatment to individuals who are in that pre trial phase at all
4940568 usually when inmates are at that stage in the criminal justice system no one is thinking about relieving their opioid withdrawal symptoms its probably the most important time because thats when the inmate or patient is at the highest level of withdrawal

4940572 anna wanted to remain at the center of the story
4940573 anna rejected the facts before her in favor of characters and situations and myths operating more vibrantly inside her own mind she lived most fully not in life but on the page
4940574 the original idea was to have people cast votes at the listeningstation for their favorite bands and then top eight would play at the sound off
4940575 we only had four entries so we decided to take all four one band dropped out and now we have three bands to perform at our concert
4940576 this is our first attempt at a performance of this nature but i think it is going to be really good
4940577 each band will perform five songs and then the audience will decide the winner at the end
4940578 we hope people will come out and bring their lawn chairs and enjoy some good music
4940579 we will have tshirts for sale a concession stand and some bands may be selling cds any money raised out side of the cds will go toward the teen programs at the library

4940582 sikander was a gloomy ferocious bigot and his zeal in destroying temples and idols was so intense that he is remembered as the idol breaker he freely used the sword to propagate islam and succeeded in forcing the bulk of the population to conform outwardly to the muslim religion most of the brahmins refused to apostatise and many of them paid with their lives the penalty for their steadfastness many others were exiled and only a few conformed
4940583 he adopted the policy of universal toleration recalled the exiled brahmins repealed the jizya or poll tax on hindus and even permitted new temples to be built he abstained from eating flesh prohibited the slaughter of kine and was justly venerated as a saint he encouraged literature painting and music and caused many translations to be made of works composed in sanskrit arabic and other languages
4940584 constructed canals and built many mosques he was just and tolerant
4940585 some fugitive chiefs of the two local factions of the makri and the chakk invited mirza haidar dughlat a relation of babar to invade kashmir the country was conquered and the mirza held it nominally in name of humayan till 1551 when he was killed in a skirmish the line was restored for a few years until in 1559 a chakk leader ghazi shah usurped the throne and in the possession of his descendants it remained for nearly thirty years
4940586 if heaven exists it is here it is here it is here
4940587 the kashmiris remained secure in their inaccessible valley but they were given up to internal weakness and discord their political importance was gone
4940588 the delhi throne is beautiful indeed but does it compare with the mountains of kandahar
4940589 a period of storm and anarchy in which assassination was the rule
4940590 created by the military and administrative genius of one man it crumbled into powder when the spirit which gave it life was withdrawn and the inheritance of the khalsa passed into the hands of the english
4940591 often unscrupulous and cruel was a man of considerable ability and efficiency
4940592 found his small kingdom a troublesome charge but after ten years of constant struggles he and his two brothers became masters of most of the country between kashmir and the punjab
4940593 we have agreed that we have no ill feelings because of the past war the two kings will henceforth remain friends forever the relationship between maharajah gulab singh of kashmir and the lama guru of lhasa dalai lama is now established the maharajah sahib with god kunchok as his witness promises to recognise ancient boundaries which should be looked after by each side without resorting to warfare when the descendants of the early kings who fled from laddakh to tibet now return they will not be stopped by shri maharajah trade between laddakh and tibet will continue as usual tibetan government traders coming into laddakh will receive free transport and accommodations as before and the laddakhi envoy will in turn receive the same facilities in lhasa the laddakhis take an oath before god kunchok that they will not intrigue or create new troubles in tibetan territory we have agreed with god as witness that shri maharajah sahib and the lama guru of lhasa will live together as members of the same household
4940594 the king of laddakh reserves to himself the village of minsar in ngarees khor sum that he may be independent there and he sets aside its revenue for the purpose of meeting the expense involved in keeping up the sacrificial lights at kangree kailas and the holy lakes of mansarovar and rakas tal
4940595 to take a leading part in arranging conditions of peace
4940596 set forth that the british government having demanded in addition to a certain assignment of territory a payment of a crore and a half of rupees and the sikh government being unable to pay the whole
4940597 should cede as equivalent to one crore the hill country belonging to the punjab between the beas and the indus including kashmir and the hazara
4940598 on the other hand the ceded tracts comprised the whole of the hereditary possessions of gulab singh who being eager to obtain an indefeasible title to them came forward and offered to pay the war indemnity on condition that he was made the independent ruler of jammu amp kashmir a separate treaty embodying this arrangement was thus concluded between the british and gulab singh at amritsar on 16 march 1846
4940599 one horse twelve shawl goats of approved breed and three pairs of kashmir shawls this arrangement was later altered the annual presentation made by the kashmir state was confined to two kashmir shawls and three romals handkerchiefs
4940600 put gulab singh as maharaja in possession of all the hill country between the indus and the ravi including kashmir jammu laddakh and gilgit but excluding lahoul kulu and some areas including chamba which for strategic purposes it was considered advisable by the british to retain and for which a remission of rs 25 lakhs was made from the crore demanded leaving rs 75 lakhs as the final amount to be paid by gulab singh

4940666 its been a long road to get to this recording so much has happened since the last record we finally got to a spot where we narrowed 15 or 16 songs down to five and just said its time we recorded it ourselves which is a first for us but to our surprise it sounds like we paid good money for it go figure it will be called either eyeballs and meatballs or face down on jackson avenue probably the latter it will be released in a couple of months
4940667 and because we produced this one ourselves we got to experiment in extremities during the recording process
4940668 we had the time to hook things up the wrong way take instruments through equipment theyre not supposed to go through do something completely wrong just to see if it sounds cool and that type of thing i think weve done some bitchin things sonically

4940691 gradually change our current unsustainable consumption and production patterns and move towards a better integrated approach to policy making it will reaffirm the need for global solidarity and recognizes the importance of strengthening our work with partners outside the eu including those rapidly developing countries which will have a significant impact on global sustainable development
4940692 a host of cultural economic social and psychological factors affect the way we behave often locking us into unsustainable consumption habits even those who say they will buy organic food for environmental reasons and the good of their own health may change their minds if products outstrip their budget

4940709 the lake is changing faster than we can study it
4940710 we dont necessarily know all the impacts but we know enough to know that they are being catastrophic
4940711 the ecological balance of the great lakes is at a tipping point can they recover or can we act quickly enough to help them recover
4940712 now all the forage fish are way down in lake michigan and lake huron
4940713 theyre one half the size they were in the 1970s and 1980s
4940714 the first time that i dove in lake michigan i was shocked at the amount of biomass down there
4940715 wasnt native nearly everything i looked at was an invasive species in and of itself or was facilitated by one
4940716 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent
4940717 the russian tanks on the streets of georgian towns remind us of the invasion in 1968
4940718 but it is not just history it is still even now a relevant question whether we will or will not belong to the sphere of russian influence
4940719 i am scared of those things that are happening in georgia now
4940720 and is beefed up with russian soldiers missiles and tanks it would take just several hours for them to ignite a similar nightmare here in lithuania if something turned really wrong
4940721 but not so with ukraine with ukraine there is fear
4940722 its very unstable politically there is a strong pro russian political element plus theres strong activity of russian intelligence
4940723 its always on top of you you see how the destruction is progressing minute by minute
4940724 when there are explosions you can feel the whole town shake
4940725 this particular project at 300 gold would be very marginal
4940726 the issue with exploration and development projects right now is the risk involved in finding mineralization
4940727 whats interesting about the old timers is that they took meticulous records and theyve been preserved so a lot of your exploration has been done so your risk profile is very very much lower
4940728 and generally in old mining areas theres a culture of mines people understand somewhat what youre doing
4940729 the security situation is good and it is progressing every day
4940730 we have some greedy politicians they put their self interest in front of the peoples interest we have a big number of political parties delineated according to their tribes the terrorists might exploit the conflicts
4940731 its imperative that we do something and do it now
4940732 id say 95 percent to 98 percent of the people want this to sit and wait until homes wash into the ocean is not an option
4940733 we have a nice view if they build dunes higher it would go
4940734 i dont know the statute on paying taxes on your home if its in the ocean
4940735 this is a band aid and a very expensive one at that
4940736 its not fair for a handful of people to jeopardize everyone elses property in the borough
4940737 when you look at oceanfront property there are three things any property owner is interested in
4940738 no 1 and the most important is the view of the ocean no 2 is access to the ocean and no 3 is the breeze which is an important factor a lot of people dont like to use their air conditioning they say the evening breeze off the ocean is something special
4940739 if you have a million dollar property its now worth 600 000
4940740 some of the major changes have happened to long term incentives and that takes a little longer to play out
4940741 his compensation is well down from what it was in 2003 to 2005
4940742 there is certainly a pay for performance mentality and system here
4940743 he felt we could have done better although we did very very well
4940744 the people are forced to choose between their cows and their children
4940745 there is no pretense that its for any other purpose its something quite unique
4940746 absolutely there are people who are getting extremely rich out of this
4940747 worse than a failed state it has become virtually a phantom state
4940748 in the villages the zaraguina have all control the government does nothing to help us
4940749 i cried all the time they hit us and they left us outside in the dirt until we had things crawling on our skin backs and arms
4940750 we have less unity than we did just two years ago and after nearly 20 years were talking more about points that divide us than unify us
4940751 the biggest critics are in the concertacion but the leaders dont want to hear about it

4940780 the most important thing is to learn the result immediately the quality of the images doesnt matter sometimes
4940781 when you send one message to twitter and we send it to 10 followers you arent charged ten times thats because weve been footing the bill
4940782 weve had discussions with all the mobile operators it hasnt been possible to work with all of them on it in terms of challenges thats been an interesting one we have an editorial vision for what we want to achieve but its working in the realities of the uk mobile market there are challenges
4940783 this particular platform is more about how it develops in the future
4940784 we dont see mobile as a mature service beijing is an end in itself but its also a stepping stone for london 2012 we want to try things out see how they work to learn for four years time
4940785 it is more likely that i will start at shortstop for the yankees
4940786 its a data machine and ultimately could become a video machine
4940787 to get on that device to get on something that people are used to looking at quite a bit even more than their phone that will be a real shot in the arm for our wireless strategy people dont look at their phone for very long its about 30 seconds and thats how people are used to enjoying non voice content on their wireless devices for a live baseball game id rather get five updates from five games rather than watch two minutes of a baseball game that may change as quality gets better as the pipe gets better as all of these things get better as screens get more robust but right now thats where it is
4940788 the helio acquisition is transformative for us the addition of a post paid platform outstanding data services and compelling handsets will enable us to offer more value to our entire customer base prepaid hybrid and post paid alike
4940789 we have seen our prepaid usage be fairly stable throughout the first half of the year and right in line with what we projected for the year if not slightly better so while we did come into the year with that mid single digit decrease we have seen very slight decreases in usage which is a normal trend as you come out of the first quarter with a lot of new gross ads into the second quarter its very consistent with what we modeled and very stable right now

4940792 ive been shooting for kambakht ishq in la yeah i play akshay kumars sibling we both play stuntmen so it kind of runs in the family and its a family that runs fast the role requires considerable physical skill and energy
4940793 the stunts are dangerous but everything is so professional here in hollywood safety while doing action scenes is top priority not just for the lead stars but also for the stuntmen otherwise the experience of working at universal is no different from the studios back home

4940800 the price increase is necessary to cover the cost of doing business
4940801 the marketplace changes and you have to change your offerings
4940802 there is no indication of any change in the near future regarding the current state of competition
4940803 market forces have not yet met the challenge of controlling price increases
4940804 we have a series of layout configurations we can use depending on whats going on
4940805 it may be that a stylist curates an entire buy every now and then
4940806 the beauty of this move is that now far more visitors to the courthouse actually view the ten commandments because it is more visible than it ever was on the courthouse grounds
4940807 i thought if every church and synagogue in america would proudly display gods law as this one church did maybe our culture could turn a corner and come back to its judeo christian roots
4940808 the aclu is not the problem with removing the ten commandments from america
4940809 we need to send them a thank you they awakened a sleeping giant
4940810 the problem has been the apathy of good citizens sitting on their hands and saying thats happening in california or boston not in omaha
4940811 listen they the aclu may have won a few skirmishes but gods going to win the war
4940812 project moses stated mission is the restoration of respect for the ten commandments so all may live out christs call for true social justice in the home communities and political policies
4940813 hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one
4940814 on every private religious property catholic protestant and jewish in america
4940815 main street right in front for the whole community to see
4940816 is not to argue whose tradition is better but to get all who view these monuments to dive into scripture and move beyond the simple 10 sentences we learned as children
4940817 if the first place someone sees the commandments is at the courthouse thats probably why he is there
4940818 political battles need to be fought but conversion and changing how people live needs to be the goal america is where it is at today morally not because of groups like the aclu but because of the apathy of the faithful
4940819 sir edmund burke said it best when he said the only thing necessary for evil to succeed is for good men to do nothing project moses gives the average believer the opportunity they have not had in the courtrooms over the past 30 years a tangible way to show support for gods laws
4940820 more than 90 percent of the churches who hold a weekend raise more money than they need to buy the monument
4940821 instead of having a cardboard cutout how about a 900 pound stone monument in an entryway
4940822 its something like 3 500 times a child will have to walk by that over the course of their grade school years they just may be able to remember them then

4940827 but she really wants to clear her name and prove to everyone shes not a racist

4941118 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there

4941120 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4941121 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich

4941132 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4941133 she tried to put the water hose on it to do what we could do but by that time it was too late
4941134 this is where the heavy questioning comes in we have to find out where that girl is
4941135 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
4941136 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important
4941137 all the generic ballot questions in the polls show voters want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want obama
4941138 he hasnt closed the sale every historical fact says he should be farther ahead than he is
4941139 obama lost the summer and part of it was he got arrogant and overreached he started talking about transition planning and going to all these red states like montana where he has no chance
4941140 a lot of americans were left scratching their heads thinking why isnt he talking to me
4941141 if he wants to win mccain has no choice but to go negative on obama
4941142 the fight is for the independents about 20 percent of the electorate
4941143 for mccain its the ties to bush and the desire for change and its obamas age inexperience and race theres enough to give people pause with each of them
4941144 they agreed to do the film because of the good story and good script when they came to know that they are pitted against each other they were extremely thrilled
4941145 i had reading sessions with both the actors it was spread over two weeks when we started shooting very little was left for experimenting on the sets both of them have interpreted their characters the way i conceived them
4941146 the film is about mr khers character pondering over the most interesting case in his career he is doing it on the eve of his retirement
4941147 it is the story of a particular wednesday the story is set between 2 p m and 6 p m in short it is a four hour story told in 105 minutes
4941148 a commercial films definition is that it entertains my film will also entertain because thats the agenda i am confident about it because the final product is good it has turned out the way i wanted it but at the same time i would say let the audiences decide
4941149 i have the support of my teammates and it just feels good to be back on the field just among the guys
4941150 things werent going well so i felt like i must open up before its too late
4941151 i wont say i was contemplating suicide but i had some very very unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost
4941152 hes a funny guy he helps you laugh and try to make the situation better
4941153 but ultimately he really showed that he cared and that meant a lot to me
4941154 we talked about making sure shawn was ok and that he got the help that he needed
4941155 when we felt that he was in a good place we talked about the football part of it
4941156 weve got to prepare like hes not there its kind of brutal but thats the way youve got to approach it
4941157 i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors
4941158 didnt want to play football no more and i admit that i created those rumors out of a lot of frustration and i didnt care what people thought
4941159 in just the couple of days that hes been here weve seen a little bit of a sense of relief when youre talking to him
4941160 its so restful and lovely its not a place to work its a place to holiday and im taking john
4941161 its called jk place the biggest celebrities of the world visit there i had the best room overlooking the ocean it was the most gorgeous suite i had ever stayed in i didnt want to work i wanted to call my boyfriend over for a holiday
4941162 we finished work very fast everyday and went sightseeing in a big group to rome capri was very cute and small we were shooting in a villa we were all together all the time i remember we couldnt get any chicken in italy there was other kind of meat that i dont eat when i finally got chicken i was so happy me whos almost a diehard vegetarian
4941163 ive rented a place close to where i live ill shift to that place while my house is being renovated it took me a while to find the rented place at the moment the rented place is being done up so i can move into it while renovation starts in my house
4941164 im waiting for the other place to be ready but in the meanwhile im staying in my own place without a bed in a makeshift corner while the workers get busy hammers and tongs so you see im not in a very happy state of mind a good time to take a holiday
4941165 if these opportunities really existed someone would have found them by now
4941166 we dont need to make capitalism more creative we just need governments to stop interfering with it

4941171 sepatutnya kerajaan pusat atau pun petronas saya tak tahu siapa yang bertanggungjawab juga kena bayar berkenaan kadar faedah keatas wang yang terkumpul
4941172 jadi kalau berdasar kepada compounded rate kadar berganda mungkin jumlahnya lebih besar daripada angka 7 8 bilion yang saya sebut secara am sebentar tadi
4941173 selain itu kita juga hendak tahu jumlah wang terkumpul dan baki kepunyaan kita yang bakal diperolehi
4941174 ia perlu dibuat perhitungan secara terperinci kerana kadar faedah adalah berubah pada setiap hari
4941175 there is no such thing as succession plan as the right is vested with the members
4941176 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
4941177 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
4941178 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
4941179 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
4941180 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
4941181 it was though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
4941182 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england
4941183 a national tragedy a day i never thought i would ever see where nigeria would act as though she had lost a war and was parcelling out its land to the victor
4941184 although some of the buildings have been completed one would have thought that all the buildings would have been completed by now
4941185 260 000 people to a new settlement without considering their traditional institutions their deities shrines and graves including their dignity
4941186 ive been shooting for kambakht ishq in la yeah i play akshay kumars sibling we both play stuntmen so it kind of runs in the family and its a family that runs fast the role requires considerable physical skill and energy
4941187 the stunts are dangerous but everything is so professional here in hollywood safety while doing action scenes is top priority not just for the lead stars but also for the stuntmen otherwise the experience of working at universal is no different from the studios back home
4941188 ive scenes with sly stallone he was a pleasure to work with
4941189 i dont know about that everyone is entitled to his or her perception
4941190 ganesh acharya had promised me that akshay kumar would be making a guest appearance for one of the songs mash a allah the next thing i know ganesh himself was dancing on screen in that song yeh ek bhanyankar surprise thaa it was a terrible surprise for me
4941191 it was something beyond my imagination to see ganesh in akshays place there was a vast difference between what ganesh had said and what he finally delivered
4941192 film ko badi maar maari hai critics ne critics have trashed the film
4941193 from now on ive decided to be only an actor in a film theres no need to advise the director specially if he thinks he knows best
4941194 i dont know how it happened even members of ones own family stop listening to you after a point ganesh felt i shouldnt interfere in his writing skills and that i should just listen to him on the sets
4941195 thoda ussmein director jag gaya the director in him become aggressive
4941196 he never discussed it with me i didnt even know about this characters existence in the plot when i finally saw the film i asked ganesh bhaiyya yeh kya hai i think somewhere while discussing the commercial angle with me ganesh lost his way
4941197 i cant figure out when prem chopraji came into my picture and why hes a senior actor and i felt ganesh was portraying him crudely i did tell him that
4941198 but ill say this my films usually speak a language of innocence that was lost in money hai to honey hai i thought i was doing a film about team spirit little did i know that so much bitterness would creep in even in the choreography i found upen patels song to be dicey
4941199 i dont believe in poking fun at people who have achieved so much i didnt know about ekta but i was told about vijay mallya and laxmi mittals names being used i was told they were being mentioned with reverence so i kept quiet
4941200 ive decided to be an obedient worker on the sets no more i tried to reason with ganesh to a point i failed we decided to work together because of our long standing friendship but as the shooting progressed we became distant thats when i became silent and moved to one corner he suddenly changed this often happens in this industry
4941201 jade wasnt sure when she was first approached because she was worried about how the indian housemates and public might react

4941203 but she really wants to clear her name and prove to everyone shes not a racist

4941230 i think ive earned my holiday i was so nervous and tense before the release that i couldnt sleep
4941231 every time a release is around the corner i put the desktop globe in front of my wife and tell her to pick a destination for a holiday i told my wife that if my new film was a hit ill take her to monte carlo if it doesnt work well have to do with mahabaleshwar
4941232 aarav never stays up beyond 10 30 p m but he watched singh is kinng till he could almost till the end then the poor fellow couldnt stay awake he fell asleep in my lap doesnt matter hell have lots of occasions to catch up with the film later
4941233 i know about amitji singing the singh is kinng song it happened after the toronto concert where i was on stage with the bachchans
4941234 really thats what makes him the real king of bollywood all of us who came into the industry after amitji have a lot to learn from him
4941235 akshay is far too generous and kind his current status is a remarkable lesson in hard work and self improvement to have done it under the extremely extenuating circumstances that he has faced is even more creditable
4941236 yes when im jamming with the band on stage during our concerts one of the items i sing is singh is kinng its great fun
4941237 no words can express my feelings today all i can say is that i will keep my rakhi promise and do whatever i can for these little ones and smitaji i cherish this rakhi very much
4941238 i make it a point to spend my free time with the children but today i felt they should enjoy festivities as well and i am happy a veteran like bappida and shweta pandit gave some of their valuable time for this cause
4941239 theres a couple of balls there that we would have liked him to come up with
4941240 thats discouraging because he was paid an awful lot of money paid like one of the top five receivers in the nfl we need him to make those plays
4941241 at the end of everything all that matters as you take everything in is how do you perform on game day for him not to make those plays
4941242 its a very big concern because we do want to do a number of things with jamarcus in the passing game
4941243 the more they make plays the more that builds confidence for him and for all of us it means a less conservative role

4941245 if aps guidelines end up like the ones they shared with me were headed for a napster style battle on the issue of fair use
4941246 drudge retort got on aps radar due to the posting of entire articles with exact headlines which all parties agreed constituted copyright violations two months before the most recent spate of digital millennium copyright act dmca take down notices
4941247 bloggers unless the ap recants and apologizes to cadenhead i urge you to avoid linking to the ap and to link to reporting at its source
4941248 ive called my lawyers really and have asked them to deliver a dmca takedown demand to the a p and i will also be sending them a bill for 12 50
4941249 is exactly what the a p would have charged me if i published a 22 word quote from one of their articles
4941250 to impose some guidelines on the free wheeling blogosphere where extensive quoting and even copying of entire news articles is common
4941251 the a p is going to assert a much stricter interpretation of fair use than most people on the internet are used to
4941252 im glad that my personal legal dispute with the ap is resolved thanks to the help of the media bloggers association but it does nothing to resolve the larger conflict between how ap interprets fair use and how thousands of people are sharing news on the web
4941253 i think ap and other media organizations should focus on how to encourage bloggers to link their stories in the manner they like rather than hoping their lawyers can rebottle the genie of social news
4941254 i think it would be helpful for bloggers and users of social news sites to know what the ap believes to be fair use of their copyrighted work
4941255 i hope that any guidelines that are issued are not interpreted as an agreed definition of fair use

4941281 giving the newspaper flexibility to contract out its printing in certain locations that are hard to reach from existing printing plants
4941282 but for others the experience has started to inform how they work
4941283 a lot of people get lost in the world of computer simulation
4941284 the hands on part is for me a critical aspect of understanding how to design
4941285 im not sure employers are recognizing the importance of hands on
4941286 people spend so much time in digital worlds that it creates an appetite for the physical world
4941287 i could probably sell it for 200 000 more than what i bought it for
4941288 five years ago we were buying high quality soybean land for 3 000 to 5 000 an acre and today its going for 6 000 to 7 000 an acre
4941289 we believe that todays prices are still an attractive investment
4941290 rents have actually doubled in the last two to three years
4941291 but we also dont like the idea of keeping fans of our products from being able to engage with our content
4941292 for the most part people who are uploading videos are fans of our movies theyre not trying to be evil pirates and theyre not trying to get revenue from it
4941293 a youtube partner made a copyright claim on one of your videos
4941294 a year ago i dont think i would have dared guess that
4941295 they want to leave it up and make money on it
4941296 stepping up to its responsibility and ending the practice of profiting from copyright infringement
4941297 but it is impossible to deal with him now he is fighting with everyone
4941298 my mother told me if my father were still alive he would take a gun and shoot himself
4941299 chateaux are confused about what they should put on their labels now and its hard to know what the best way forward is for st milion
4941300 but we have sun in september and i think it will be right to harvest in six or eight days
4941301 youve gotta know when to hold em know when to fold em
4941302 they just quit the right stuff at the right time
4941303 how do you draw the line between whats attainable and whats not
4941304 this relentless pursuit of goals has a cost to it
4941305 if you are a pursuing a goal that is constantly frustrating you will be less successful in goal attainment in other areas of life
4941306 one of the most frustrating goals for people is weight loss or weight loss maintenance
4941307 stepping back temporarily and saying im going to try to live a healthy life and not try so hard to lose weight
4941308 yeah thats a type of player we just dont have
4941309 those could have been our moments we didnt turn those into goals very sad otherwise it was us in the semi finals next tuesday
4941310 we had trouble against equal or weaker opponents and played reasonable against this strong opponent argentina was just a tad smarter and better but collectively we worked hard it took too long for us to gel as a team now i can see the first signs but its too late were going home
4941311 with a bit of luck we would have won its sad but we didnt i do feel we can say farewell with our chins up the concentration and mentality were fine the result let us down
4941312 as a care givers in tune with our baby we were able to identify our babys wee or poo cues and simply responded by promptly taking the nappy off and sitting our bub on the potty toilet we also let our kids run nappy free at home from the moment they could walk you might think our whole house ended up a toilet but i promise it didnt anyone who knows me and my level of neuroses when it comes to cleanliness will believe that i couldnt have let that happen while i have to admit that there were some pishy accidents neither of them ever pooed on the floor no instead our kids learnt very young to take note of their bodily functions and act upon them
4941313 its not about changing the way a journalist works on a given day its about changing a journalists perception of their career
4941314 we want our journalists to see their careers a bit more broadly and also to allow us in the future to deploy our journalists on the medium that needs the most resources during a defined time period
4941315 it isnt only about technology its about ideas and using existing technology in an original way some of it could be very engineering based some of it could be quite tv based i still think theres a lot of new technological scope for innovation in delivering television more efficiently

4941319 being in an office where you can collaborate with others can be very beneficial
4941320 everyone still has a desk either here or from a bureau as an umbilical cord
4941321 but at least 80 of reporters are just on laptops it really spiked in 2007
4941322 i have filed plenty from my laptop in my car
4941323 i dont have the ability yet where i dont need an editor above me i sometimes wish i had someone over my shoulder more

4941329 editors remain confident about a mixed media future and have quietly got on with the business of integrating their newsrooms
4941330 tempered by anxiety that newspapers are not investing enough in recruitment and training for the future
4941331 i read the message of this years newsroom barometer as an appeal from editors to their companies to be bold in the face of change and as a sign that they themselves intend to make the most of new opportunities
4941332 perhaps the most important finding to emerge from the 2008 survey is that editors remain optimistic about the futures of their papers
4941333 for these editors the future is self evident and our survey shows that they see the writing on the newsroom wall the evolution of the 4th estate is no longer questions of if when or how editors now know the solution innovate integrate or perish

4941339 change is hard for anyone and i think its a historic challenge for traditional publishers now
4941340 the challenge for us is to become not just a publisher but a technology company in order to support that publisher
4941341 improving the development of new editorial products refining the subscription model changing the way the business works internally
4941342 we need to learn from the web start up and pure play web company approach that has technology much closer with the business publishers cant just think its the it department over the wall that they throw stuff to youve got to have the right platform approach mindset and processes to keep up
4941343 remodeling the company to become more agile and to launch products in a more iterative webby way

4941349 but the ones that provide a sustainable value to users will not only survive but will be stronger that will be good for consumers and good for journalism
4941350 with the new focus and the addition of space dedicated to business corporate and general news the journal will be stronger than ever
4941351 traditional media must live in the digital world on its own terms
4941352 once the technology genie is out of the bottle theres no way to put it back in
4941353 learn the incremental journalism of bloggers adding facts analysis and aggregation over a period of time
4941354 traditional media must live in the digital world on its own terms
4941355 once the technology genie is out of the bottle theres no way to put it back in
4941356 learn the incremental journalism of bloggers adding facts analysis and aggregation over a period of time
4941357 its crucial that those skills those ethics that fairness is not lost in the rush to new technology this is the best time in history for new journalists to make their own way start their own media outlet and get noticed
4941358 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4941359 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4941360 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4941361 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4941362 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4941363 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4941364 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4941365 when the announcer said hattigs name on the stadium microphone i was thinking to myself where have i heard that name before
4941366 then i heard it announced how he was a big league guy and then it clicked right away oh yeah john hattig it crossed my mind and i was having to think about how i had to get him out at the same time
4941367 thats the only type of thing about this situation that can be a little tricky
4941368 to be honest i wish it could be more like it was where you had these groups of young guys to develop
4941369 but the business at hand is to win and put people in the seats youre incapable of doing that and youre going to look foolish if you insist on building your team around first year players when all the others are beating you with a wealth of experience and talent
4941370 when youre in a developmental league for rookies youre there for specifically that very reason
4941371 their main concern is your growth and development theyre tuning you up its not a matter of your numbers or so much your ability even that is keeping you around
4941372 you get to be patient with your at bats and your innings pitched players cant get that here when youre trying to win a division championship in a season that is already pretty short there isnt that type of time for teams to nurture you
4941373 youre constantly facing guys who have a better playing background
4941374 generally you figure the younger guys in rookie ball are more apt to making mistakes
4941375 the hitters who are more seasoned are the ones that make you earn your outs theyre going to make you battle to find ways to keep them off base
4941376 ive learned a ton from being at the park every day with those guys
4941377 its like how they always say you graduate from college and they give you a piece of paper telling you that you did it but what about life experience how much of that does a college degree give you there are certain situations you have to live through before you can make it by
4941378 there are a lot of people with new wealth looking for relaxation and enjoyment
4941379 it takes two years to build some of these yachts and the demand hasnt slowed down
4941380 most of our clients have earned their wealth in one generation
4941381 the charter market has allowed people to buy boats a little larger than they would have wanted to invest in had they not seen it as a source of revenue to help defray their operating costs
4941382 we have one owner and this is his fourth boat and hes never taken delivery
4941383 rich people dont want to wait on a boat and theyll pay a premium this owner has taken that premium and moved to the back of the line
4941384 the indian ships will be present in the ior for a while doing some flag showing and also engaging in naval diplomacy with some port calls mid sea exercises and interaction with personnel from the navies of the west asian countries and the african continent
4941385 a na pas encore commenc la question du retrait est maintenant examin e et la d cision sera prise quand la situation sera stabilis e
4941386 les colonnes se dirigent de tskhinvali capitale de loss tie du sud vers la russie
4941387 the elephants and pianos were all on my shoulders and my heart was pounding and my stomach was gone and its a long way when youre feeling like that
4941388 the networks daily examination of news from the campaign trail that combines cnns unrivaled field reporting and analysis with state of the art broadcasting technology
4941389 we recognize that people want an email address that reflects who they are
4941390 we have a lot of user ids out there and it is pretty crowded we want to remedy that and make sure users get the id they want
4941391 a happy user is one that stays around and is a yahoo user for life
4941392 if you have an email address that is your name at ymail that becomes part of your identity
4941393 this adds millions and millions of new yahoo accounts out there for users
4941394 effectively we are tripling the size of the yahoo name space
4941395 remember with simplicity comes effortlessness a few simple but flexible buckets can get your bits and bytes under control so you can spend less time moving files around and more time getting work done
4941396 im always a fan of when something thats theoretical gets made real because it makes people act
4941397 underscores the need for people to be able to have more intelligence on the dns
4941398 one of the first things that our setup software does is change that default name
4941399 so anyone who does as we ask with the initial setup will be prompted to change that
4941400 the vast majority of home users have a device with a default password
4941401 the development production and stockpiling of bacteriological biological and toxin weapons
4941402 i am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes
4941403 unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united states
4941404 an impressive military arsenal of aircraft carriers and gun boats
4941405 justification for extending the campaign against international terrorism to iraq washington singled out iraq north korea iran syria and libya of violating the international treaty banning weapons of germ warfare
4941406 confirms that the us has built an extensive arsenal of biological weapons in blatant violation of international laws and covenants
4941407 respected scientists on both sides of the atlantic warned that the us is illegally developing a new generation of weapons that undermine and possibly violate international treaties on biological and chemical warfare
4941408 us armed forces push for offensive biological weapons development genetically engineered microbes that attack items such as fuel plastics and asphalt
4941409 are probably only the tip of the iceberg the national academies are also concealing related documents after the sunshine project requested copies on march 12 2002 they placed a security hold on the public file
4941410 the research proposed by the air force and navy raises serious legal questions under the 1989 us biological weapons anti terrorism act development of biological weapons including those that attack materials is subject to federal criminal and civil penalties
4941411 proposed research for a new fort detrick homeland security center may violate an international ban on biological weapons and encourage other countries to follow
4941412 vast germ warfare laboratory intended to help protect the us against an attack with biological weapons but critics say the laboratorys work will violate international law and its extreme secrecy will exacerbate a biological arms race by accelerat ing work on similar facilities around the world
4941413 heavily guarded and hermetically sealed chambers to produce and stockpile the worlds most lethal bacteria and viruses
4941414 conduct s basic and applied research on biological threats to provide cutting edge medical research for the warfighter against biological threats
4941415 program constitutes clear violations of the international 1972 bwc arms control treaty ratified by the united states in 1975
4941416 parties to this convention are determined to act with a view to achieving effective progress towards general and complete disarmament including the prohibition and elimination of all types of weapons of mass destruction and convinced that the prohibition of the development production and stockpiling of chemical and bacteriological biological weapons and their elimination through effective measures will facilitate the achievement of general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control
4941417 repugnant to the conscience of mankind that no effort should be spared to minimize this risk
4941418 acquiring growing modifying storing packaging and dispersing classical emerging and genetically engineered pathogens
4941419 the possibility of a man made disaster either accidental or deliberate for the entire world
4941420 among our many initiatives we are continuing to develop more forward looking analyses to include red teaming efforts to understand new scientific trends that may be exploited by our adversaries to develop biological weapons and to help position intelligence collectors ahead of the problem
4941421 red teaming means that we actually have people out there on a red team plotting planning scheming and conspiring how to use biowarfare
4941422 impossible to distinguish between defensive and offensive research in the field
4941423 scores of us universities and biotechnology companies since 2001 have benefitted handsomely from billions of dollars in biodefense cash across the country biodefense labs are sprouting up like weeds the unrelenting spigot of federal money has thousands of scientists and technicians
4941424 sabotaged the verification protocol for the bwc and fully intend s to engage in research development and testing of illegal and criminal offensive biowarfare programs
4941425 the costliest most grandiose research scheme ever attempted with germ warfare capability going forward under president bush and in defiance of
4941426 germ warfare was an isolated happenstance todays efforts elevate it to an instrument of deadly and loathsome policy
4941427 it is time for the world to change gods hand behind bird flu virus
4941428 a signatory to the biowarfare convention and does not conduct bioweapons research
4941429 outlines how and why the united states government initiated sustained and then dramatically expanded an illegal biological arms buildup
4941430 represent s a significant emerging danger to our population and threaten s international relations among nations
4941431 are always called defensive but with biological weapons defensive and offensive programs overlap almost completely
4941432 boyle also sheds new light on the motives for the 2001 anthrax attacks the media black hole of silence about them and why the fbi may never apprehended the perpetrators of this seminal crime of the 21st century
4941433 a catastrophic biowarfare or bioterrorist incident or accident is a statistical certainty
4941434 misuse of tools technology or knowledge base of bioweapons research for offensive military or terrorist purposes

4941455 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4941456 i dont read media matters if asked would i rather read media matters debbie schlussel or jump off a tall building im gonna ask you well how talls the building because it is the best choice of the three
4941457 this group of radical leftists paid by george soros with a mission to discredit conservatives this isnt the kind of group i think we should feel compelled to be answering all the time our side seems to think well i dont want to be criticized we dont wanna look bad the more media matters criticizes me the better i like it and the less i intend to read it we can talk about media matters about as long as i can tolerate it and im already close to my limit
4941458 who cares i dont care my comment on media matters is who cares
4941459 i think that media matters wouldnt know a serious flaw if it bit em in the behind i cant stand media matters i dont think media matters does anything of worth if you think theres a serious flaw what is it when you mention media matters i am thinking that i am wasting my time listening for the next two minutes if you want to talk to me about media matters im out
4941460 barack obamas people dont want people reading whats in this book
4941461 im not a part of the washington establishment name dropping washington cocktail party establishment and im never gonna be a part of that because that is not who i am
4941462 appearing on a show is not an endorsement of the host i do a 120 shows and do most of the shows that come to me if i had to agree with every talk show host id never go on any shows being on a show does not mean i endorse a hosts views i have even been on liberal shows and i sure dont endorse them
4941463 thatll make you a nut to those guys you better be careful about agreeing with me about anything
4941464 it certainly looks more than suspicious and now obama is trying to explain how all of this relates and what is the relationship i dont know if i was working with anybody first of all i cant imagine that i would ever want to be associated with someone like rezko let alone taking campaign contributions from him or um letting him be involved in buying a property with me im asking what i am saying is i am not definitively concluding anything im just saying that these questions arent being sufficiently asked in the chicago newspapers research they are reporting them im asking the same questions the chicago papers are asking which obama has not truly answered to answer them fully you might need the authority of a prosecutor you might need the authority of a criminal investigator you might even need the authority of a grand jury
4941465 im an investigative reporter saying okay heres the issue and im raising a question about these issues now im not a prosecutor i dont have subpoena power i dont have grand jury power i cant tell testimony but you know if i were in those positions i might well consider doing so but im not im an investigative reporter i just raise questions and i dont say anywhere in the book i dont say anything definitive about it more than this looks suspicious there are some things that are pretty definitive you know im positive that the frank in dreams of my father is frank marshall davis but even in his rebuttal it confirms that i dont think there is any question that frank is frank marshall davis weve established that now whether the loan was involved in the purchase of the obama dream property i cant say for sure one way or the other i just ask questions
4941466 why did it take obama so long to conclude that rezko was a shady character
4941467 were just trying to win races and it doesnt matter if some are on one day
4941468 we got more pressure from lethal heat than i thought we would and she tried to run off on the front end
4941469 jockey joel rosario couldnt keep her under control as much as we wanted him to
4941470 when i went into this meet i was so nervous going into this olympics with six events
4941471 i have never done it at such a high caliber but it got better as it went on
4941472 im competitive so i wanted to win gold in the 50 i gave it my best shot and im thinking maybe i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
4941473 the dream goes away you know in a few seconds but im going to try to do it again
4941474 i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon in a bus
4941475 its just been really stiff lack of range of motion and just not enough time to heal it
4941476 i was trying to hope that it would warm up as i went further and further but it just got stiffer and stiffer
4941477 i dont know but i appreciate them for saying that
4941478 the nba is such a long season and weve been pretty much playing every summer i had a chance to let my body heal a little bit and im back to my old ways
4941479 last season i tried to come back quickly and didnt give my body a chance to get strong and get back to the form that i needed it to
4941480 thats why this season when we were having a terrible year i took time off and got my body right so i can play these games and be healthy for the rest of my career
4941481 his athletic ability his speed he looks like a rookie out there
4941482 were going to be a lot better than we were last year
4941483 michael beasley could have easily been the no 1 pick with a healthy me and being with shawn marion we got three guys that can really put the ball in the basket and make things happen
4941484 i may need more races i dont have any excuses my hamstring felt good it was no problem i wasnt overwhelmed by being at the olympics im pretty upset my family is here praying for me i feel i let them down i did my best everybody knows that
4941485 my leg is healthy 100 percent my fitness is not there my mechanics werent where i wanted them to be i felt i ran out of time to prepare it just didnt come together
4941486 you hop on a plane and you get here in 12 hours
4941487 every game every run every pitch theres so much lying on it
4941488 to see the cubans where else are you going to go
4941489 to see korea this is the place to go to see their best players same with taiwan its a matter of seeing all the better players in the world in one venue
4941490 youre just looking for talent period you never know when any talent is going to be available so you have to constantly keep in check
4941491 its a couple of things one you look to try to see if theres somebody you can sign now and two for the future
4941492 jag v rmer upp i en timme och b rjar med att jogga i n gon minut
4941493 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4941494 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4941495 part of my contract was getting invited to spring training but its not like i earned it
4941496 a lot of guys will judge you by that and not see the real person
4941497 a lot of signing bonuses come because of what you did in college once you get the signing bonus what you did in college doesnt mean anything youve got to prove yourself all over again
4941498 were calling it a contusion right now im not concerned
4941499 some feelings i havent felt in awhile but i was excited
4941500 in an effort to respect the privacy of elena and the delle donne family
4941501 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4941502 i just couldnt live on one healthy foot anymore let alone try to skate
4941503 its just a shame it took 13 years and ruined a fan base
4941504 will power and i were in the position to go for the championship in champ car and we found ourselves two weeks later being five blocks down at homestead
4941505 so that was the hardest part to get used to that were not going to be competitive on ovals for a while
4941506 the tough thing but the good thing is we have to race these guys now
4941507 theyre pushing us already a lot on the road courses the competition is as tight as i remember all the big names all the big teams all the best drivers
4941508 were obviously still way behind when it comes to really knowing what these cars need on the ovals
4941509 and as i said its still going to take some time for us to figure it out
4941510 we wanted everyone to know that unification was not the answer
4941511 its a rebuilding process the early signs are there but we still have a lot of work to do its a journey now not a destination
4941512 im not using anything as an excuse just inefficient with my pitches ive got to use more of the plate rather than hitting edges
4941513 i didnt want to keep trying im going to be fine i can throw its not like i cant throw anymore
4941514 could be possible but im not sure why i feel good its not like i feel tired or anything i still have my velocity when you get tired you lose your velocity in houston i was throwing 94 mph i dont think im getting tired
4941515 im trying to do the same thing i did in the minor leagues
4941516 this is all a dream come true being able to imagine anything and work toward it
4941517 having ups having downs and being able to accomplish everything you ever dreamed of feels pretty good
4941518 she started crying i started crying my sister started crying its been fun im glad i was able to accomplish everything i wanted to im lucky to have the talent i have the drive i have the excitement for the sport
4941519 i eat whatever i want whenever i want in whatever quantity i want
4941520 a na pas encore commenc la question du retrait est maintenant examin e et la d cision sera prise quand la situation sera stabilis e

4941522 i think its one of the greatest things sports in general has ever seen
4941523 he got up there on the blocks against seven different people
4941524 i have worked in this shop serving and packing chips for more than three years and i have never been checked for any diseases
4941525 i am quite certain that none of my workmates has ever gone for medical screening i only go to hospital when i get malaria or some other illness
4941526 just like every institution serving the public we have laws in place which we expect people to adhere to for their own benefit
4941527 however it is also a fact that not everyone respects the law

4941529 a lot of that strength was spent on the re run
4941530 and my temperature rose the day before the start if it werent for that i could have taken the gold
4941531 its a good thing i managed to recover i think ill feel better for the relay also i swam in the sixth lane and couldnt keep an eye on everyone i started off fast because i thought that would be the best thing to do i think that if i had swum in the centre lane i could have better managed to spare my strength and control the situation but anyway im pleased with the result
4941532 since the phase out of the hd dvd format in favour of blu ray discs sony ps3s sales have been boosted due to its blu ray technology
4941533 nintendo has gained a niche market because of its interactive consoles and with products such as wii fit allowing users to exercise while playing since the launch of the xbox elite at last years gitex microsoft has seen resurgence in sales other products such as the sony psp have also created a new segment of gamers by offering portability high quality graphics and sounds its additional features including mp3 players and fashionable colours of pink and white have targeted women as well
4941534 there hasnt really been an error in the timing system that ive ever heard of the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4941535 we dont want to have any doubts about the decision and the integrity of fina
4941536 they say this is how it happened and we assume everybody was treated equally in the race
4941537 were satisfied with the silver medal it would have been nice to win gold but we only wanted silver for this race
4941538 ocean city is marylands only recreational beach resort and we send hundreds of millions of dollars to the state over 100 million every year
4941539 the business people ive talked to while down here have told me they think its a good idea and cant understand why people are opposed to it
4941540 its a reasonable proposal its moderate its limited and its very much state controlled
4941541 would be terrible as long as it stays over there
4941542 in the fall i would think they would bring in lots of bus trips and things like that
4941543 i believe it would help control taxes and provide some revenue in off season months
4941544 its about getting the message to the thousands of visitors that come to ocean city
4941545 this is a vibrant family oriented community and we just feel slots would do nothing but bring negativity here destroy small businesses bring additional crime and the need for additional social services to deal with addiction
4941546 i think it might be ok if they have them
4941547 were not gamblers and we have kids so we would come to the shore regardless of a casino
4941548 people might go for a day but theyre not going to stop coming to the beach i dont think it will hurt ocean city
4941549 i think itll bring a lower class of people playing their last quarters when families see that theyre not going to come out here
4941550 this is exactly like a shore birds game i dont think slots would fit here i kind of like the crowd as it is
4941551 itll bring more money around here and people will have to pay better wages
4941552 i wish i could have won give her that birthday gift
4941553 hes just happy to see me step in the ring in the olympics
4941554 so much time that i put in and so much time that he put in

4941556 i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line
4941557 i dont think theres any way anyone could have beaten him with a run like that today
4941558 youve got a young guy doing things that havent been done before hes a freak of nature you guys saw it for yourself i just happened to have a front row seat
4941559 i didnt even know i got the world record until after i finished the victory lap actually i wanted to come in and be olympic champion i did that so i was happy with myself
4941560 we shot 45 percent from the 3 and we shot close to 80 from the free throw line so thats a plus if we can do that
4941561 we know were going to defend we know were going to get fast break points but when we can shoot the ball from the outside like that and shoot free throws well its going to be tough to beat us
4941562 im competitive so i wanted to win gold in the 50
4941563 i gave it my best shot and im thinking maybe i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
4941564 its our race to win its our race to lose
4941565 its horse racing so anything can happen but we like our horse
4941566 hes on top of his game hes better than last year
4941567 he looks better hes training better hes run four races this year and hes won two and finished second twice
4941568 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4941569 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4941570 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom

4941580 after the me will the west convince itself russia needs invading again
4941581 and before the usual crowd piles in about another lodestar wind up this is a serious question
4941582 but the russians do not distinguish between the germans and the french the british and the americans for them we are all simply men of western civilization with our higher standard of life with our superior machines and weapons and with our refusal to treat the russians as equals thus while doing nothing to weaken western strength our diplomacy should always be on watch to lessen russian fears and russian suspicions it is a great nuisance that russia should exist at all but since she does it is up to us who are not driven mad by fear and suspicion to treat her seriously many russian fears are groundless we can do nothing to meet them some however have a basis in history and even a crazy rationality

4941590 he is just kind of like ok see ya later and he leaves
4941591 we generally say that 4 is old enough for the parent to bring a kid to a party and then come back when the party is over
4941592 parents start to leave their kids at parties around 6 or 7
4941593 and by 8 or 9 the kids dont want you there anymore
4941594 sometimes my wife will say all the other husbands were at the last party

4941608 this is unusual in that its almost 100 percent focused on featuring baltimore artists
4941609 it was the direction of the baltimore development corp and the baltimore hotel corp and hilton embraced it it helps create a visual memory of the place so people know theyre in baltimore and not another city
4941610 people will stop and look and ask what is this about

4941622 my granddad always told me to take off my hat when i was inside
4941623 thats pretty much the policy we go by here at school i dont mind if they bring hats to school but i dont want them wearing them while theyre inside
4941624 now if we decide to have a wear a hat to school day then thats different
4941625 and i think we as teachers and administrators should wear a hat that day too we should participate with our students if you come wearing a hat it means a lot to the kids it means you care enough about them to take part in what they do

4941638 we have been told from an early age that if we do wrong we shall die and go to a frightening place called hell we believe that what others perceive as sin are just the negative memories stored by our brain once we confess and confront them they cease to haunt us and we regain our freedom

4941694 we dont have good numbers but we know it is happening people are abandoning their fields of agave and flipping over to other crops
4941695 you practically had to guard your field with an army
4941696 a lot of people got rich and suddenly everybody was planting agave
4941697 you tend an agave for six years and then the price drops on you or you get hit with a freeze or something its a lot of investment to lose
4941698 its a whole problem of mentality where you have millions of acres focused on producing just a few crops
4941699 when the price of agave is low people get demoralized and abandon their crops
4941700 we are really quite close to rethinking the american political convention
4941701 im not sure most voters would miss them but they do serve this important ritualistic function
4941702 people say its not what it used to be but were excited
4941703 people say theres no mystery to it anymore but this political year is different the primaries were unbelievable you hear people talking about politics that never did that before
4941704 minnesotans arent usually known for being boastful but this time were putting all that aside
4941705 if we look ahead to 2012 the conventions will probably look pretty much the same
4941706 commanded less than the overwhelming attention of the american people
4941707 we know that students are more capable if they are embedded in their academic program and they are engaged in the campus
4941708 in general you do see more people out and about before people would go right to a game now they make a night of it
4941709 i was talking to students who live near van buren and they didnt know what first friday is
4941710 it will take time for the university to find more ways to connect
4941711 there are a lot of businesses that dont have late or weekend hours
4941712 i had heard of these places to eat but i didnt know where they were
4941713 i say this with the greatest respect for mark but what phelps is doing right now is 1 000 if not 100 000 times more difficult than it was in 1972
4941714 he is a genius at it he is one of the few guys we have on the team who knows the sport so well
4941715 we expect him to get gold medals and break records in many years well go back and realize just how special he is
4941716 he went up to mark and started telling him i was a much better swimmer than you are than youll ever be
4941717 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4941718 the debate could ensue that you could have mergers in some areas provided the necessary dialogue is instituted and owned by the cabinet parliament and the people
4941719 the ministry has a mandate to ensure that we have viable and efficient local authorities to ensure efficient services these councils are very weak financially and secondly and do not have the capacity to deliver efficient services
4941720 some of these exist purely for political purposes the minister said
4941721 some had a backlog of 10 to 15 years before they were last audited that is a very serious problem
4941722 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
4941723 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
4941724 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
4941725 we just dont have as much money as we used to
4941726 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
4941727 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
4941728 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
4941729 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
4941730 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
4941731 we are not staying home with our children by default
4941732 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
4941733 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
4941734 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
4941735 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
4941736 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
4941737 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
4941738 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
4941739 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
4941740 im trying to work out a baby sitting swap arrangement with friends
4941741 if it works well go and see the new batman movie maybe

4941744 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4941745 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4941746 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4941747 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word

4941749 i cant explain my new blackout but three medals from beijing in the family is okay
4941750 when i consider the pressure expectation and the attention that surrounded me at the time i honestly feel quite unwell
4941751 im so glad i didnt realise the intense public and media interest surrounding me back then as i fear i may have buckled under the massive weight if i had been aware
4941752 chinas only male athletics olympic champion is under pressure to perform and win my only advice to liu xiang is to just breathe breathe breathe and to just do what you know
4941753 unfortunately when you are carrying the hopes of a whole nation you cant really get away from it everywhere he goes there are always chinese people he cannot hide from them he knows he is such a big star and cannot get away from that
4941754 now if he wins he can do anything he wants for the rest of his days
4941755 a lot of people can win theres really only one person who can lose this race and thats liu xiang

4941774 i completely spaced out on my mark which is my fault ive never done it before and ill probably never do it again but it was just one of those things
4941775 i thought his putt would break a lot and it didnt break thats what i was thinking it doesnt break as much as it looks dont play as much to the left as i first thought
4941776 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4941777 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had
4941778 i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4941779 i let my swimming do my talking but i always welcome comments
4941780 it has been nothing but fun the biggest thing is nothing is impossible all it takes is imagination
4941781 an honor to be in the same pool with him
4941782 now we will see if he is an extraterrestrial or something
4941783 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming in a way for the kids coming up
4941784 someone told me they aired my race on a jumbotron in the middle of a baseball game my goal is starting to happen but i think theres a long way to go
4941785 it shows when you set your imagination to doing something big anything can happen
4941786 so youre the new kid on narutos team whore you

4941788 alright then to test you out how about a quick battle me and akamaru versus you and rayne right
4941789 whattya say rayne wanna fight wanna taste blood again want revenge
4941790 we can use that move if you want you need to practice in your other form anyways maybe if we had we could have stopped him
4941791 theres your answer boy well fight but you can pick up the pieces of your mutt when were through
4941792 it feels good for the caribbean to be creating this kind of dominance and for me to be a part of it
4941793 when you go to jamaica and you see how track and field is respected in the country they should have the olympic champion
4941794 they have given such gifts to the sprint world whether it be to the united kingdom or whoever
4941795 for the caribbean this final said that the things i used to dream of im seeing in my lifetime
4941796 its not so good for the united states but its good to see the little countries dominate
4941797 track and field in the caribbean is just getting better and better
4941798 we used to lose a lot of our athletes they went to the states they got themselves in trouble the coaches overworked them some didnt complete their education
4941799 what we are trying to do is keep them at home expose them to high performance training and this has paid off

4941813 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4941814 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4941815 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4941816 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4941817 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4941818 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further
4941819 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it took was a little imagination
4941820 its been such an unbelievable roller coaster its been such an unbelievable ride all i want to do is go see my mom
4941821 an extraordinary chapter in olympic history has been written here in beijing by one of the greatest athletes of all time we could not be more proud of michael
4941822 the fact that his eighth medal was won in a team relay signifies michaels commitment not only to his own quest but to the importance of teamwork
4941823 we wanted to do this for all of us not just michael
4941824 but as far as whether well ever see another like mike mark came around 30 some years ago but the term spitzian feat might be outdated now
4941825 it might be phelpsian feat i think i just coined that phrase
4941826 i didnt know what to expect when we got there and what it turned out to be was a really great time
4941827 im living the dream right now playing in the minors
4941828 i guess people know who i am in these parts i coached little league i am not a celebrity
4941829 non possibile acquisire un elenco di code da questo host
4941830 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4941831 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4941832 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4941833 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4941834 much to our mutual disappointment i wont be appearing in qts forthcoming inglorious bastards due to insurmountable scheduling difficulties
4941835 we really tried to make it work but in the end it just was not possible without severe ramifications elsewhere
4941836 except for the lobby there are none of the original elements
4941837 it may be a re creation but thats not historic preservation
4941838 that extraordinary entrance evokes 1918 but the rest has been stripped to its walls sadly
4941839 i really questioned your judgment when you accepted my application to run for office
4941840 in her heart she knew better but the law required it
4941841 the merger of sbi and sbs is being executed against the interests of the nation merger of any of the associate banks with sbi will certainly affect the implementation of government sponsored schemes in the predominant area of associate banks
4941842 the indian ships will be present in the ior for a while doing some flag showing and also engaging in naval diplomacy with some port calls mid sea exercises and interaction with personnel from the navies of the west asian countries and the african continent
4941843 our boys were never given a chance to fight back after 10 minutes of heavy gunfire the rebels withdrew to a nearby wooded area were sending additional forces to punish the rebels we cant allow this to happen
4941844 the university would be dedicated to research and dissemination of knowledge through education in police related subjects in a comprehensive manner
4941845 we have witnessed healthy growth in bilateral trade with various countries reflecting the growing confidence in the trading infrastructure and opportunities offered by dubai
4941846 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
4941847 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
4941848 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
4941849 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
4941850 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
4941851 it was though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
4941852 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england
4941853 as the manager of the team there were two fundamental responsibilities
4941854 one was to win the game and the second was just as important to get everyone home safely there is no easy answer
4941855 i wish some more balls would have been hit to him
4941856 the first one i thought should have been caught to be honest with you but i can understand some reluctance its his first time out there but i think with more experience hell catch that ball
4941857 its just another step of them throwing me out there and seeing what my limits are what i can do to help the ball club
4941858 financially we got to where we needed to be it wasnt about the money he wanted to go to college i really thought we were going to sign him
4941859 one of the guys that i probably try to emulate more than anybody
4941860 i was managing in harrisburg in 1987 and we had some pretty good players on that club but we didnt have a very good team
4941861 it was the end of may and we lost 11 games in a row all of them on the road
4941862 i think that can do attitude is a real plus
4941863 it says to me it doesnt matter who you are how old you are how successful you have been in the past you can do it that applies to more than athletics it applies to life
4941864 my comment to him was if dara can do it we can do it
4941865 im not going to win any medals for what i am doing
4941866 the sex and the city people are fun but its important to remember that its entertainment
4941867 but at the end of the day she doesnt inspire me
4941868 many people consider those celebrities completely separated from the world in which they live
4941869 there are times when i feel 40 and i feel like theres a piano on my back and i cant lift my arms up out of the pool and there are times when i feel like im 20 and just flying through the water
4941870 it feels good for the caribbean to be creating this kind of dominance
4941871 for the caribbean this final said that the things i used to dream of im seeing it in my lifetime
4941872 wfan is definitely in flux it was just starting to get its sea legs back with its new morning show which is getting some ratings
4941873 but now one half russo of the most profitable program on the radio station is gone
4941874 that stuff about his contentious relationship with mike francesa is overblown we had many more good days than bad ones
4941875 you can pull data for reputation from ebay but the thing about the difference between what tim was talking about maps and ebays reputation information is that the mapping data makes sense when you pull it out of the system whereas the reputation data because ebay is so skewed its such a bizarre social environment everybody is under tremendous pressure to make this sort of you know a best sale ive ever had which i mean would only exist if the guy who was selling you the thing drove me the item from kansas or something otherwise its just probably b so the reputation information is perfect or its terrible and when you pull it out of that system it doesnt match up it doesnt translate with other walled garden reputations
4941876 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4941877 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4941878 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4941879 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4941880 i cant hug a stranger when i win in singles
4941881 being able to share this with somebody somebody you like very much
4941882 we have been lucky enough to have these two running at this age its important to treat the horses right and thats what we have done with them
4941883 every day it seems like im in sort of a dream world
4941884 sometimes you sort of have to pinch yourself to see if its really real
4941885 i think it really shows that no matter what you set your imagination to anything can happen
4941886 if you dream as big as you can dream anything is possible
4941887 i want to become the first michael phelps not the second mark spitz
4941888 i want to do something that no one else has ever done before
4941889 my doctor said i should take up some sort of exercise to build myself up
4941890 i got into a swimming pool at the ymca and liked it and i found i had a natural flair for it
4941891 bachrach kept young weissmuller under wraps for a year refining his start and stroke in august 1921 he turned his protege loose to win national championships in the 50 yard and 220 yard distances
4941892 first saw the light of day nearer the danube than the susquehanna
4941893 in order to get an american passport weissmuller needed to produce legal proof of citizenship no doubt that was the reason for switching birthplaces from chicago to winber for there in the baptismal records of st john cantilus catholic church was an entry for johnnys brother peter
4941894 petrus weissmuller is written in one hand with john inserted between the first and last names in distinctly different ink and penmanship church officials today arent sure when or how the record was altered
4941895 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open
4941896 there are always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4941897 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4941898 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4941899 gigantisch unglaublich sie hat so eine lockerheit bekommen das ist gro artig
4941900 ich habe mich noch nicht entschieden ob ich weitermache oder nicht ich muss jetzt erstmal feststellen wo ich bin und wo ich hin will daf r muss ich tief in mich hineinschauen
4941901 es gibt im schwimmen immer neue herausforderungen das sieht man ja an michael phelps obwohl ich sowas sicher nicht erreichen will
4941902 manufacturer huawei model e220 etc to confirm i could tip to all three of them although the first is the one you will need to use
4941903 i didnt even know i got the world record until after i finished my victory lap actually
4941904 one aim was just to come here and be olympic champion i did just that so i was happy with myself it means a lot to my country and it means a lot to me
4941905 youve got a young guy whos doing things that havent been done before the guy just broke the olympic record and the world record
4941906 hes just having fun its everyone trying to catch up to usain bolt even his own countrymen are trying to catch up to him hes in a league of his own
4941907 how do you deal with jordan how do you deal with lebron hes a freak of nature you guys saw it for yourselves i just happened to have a front row seat
4941908 its not bothering me i dont have any type of excuses i wasnt too overwhelmed with it being the olympics its just one of those things that happened maybe i could have done some more training or more races but besides that i just kept trying to get my rhythm through each round
4941909 i thought i had a better start than i had the first two rounds its kind of hard to tell where youre at try to gauge yourself i pretty much ran hard to the finish line and gave it all that i had
4941910 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my familys here everyone at home is supporting me and praying for me my spirits are a little down but at the same time i gave it my best everyone knows that i feel like i just ran out of time
4941911 my aim is to just come here and win i have a lot more time to think about world records
4941912 it was nice to hit the home run and help the team out there because ive been struggling at the plate lately then that error just was i dont know i just tried to be a little bit too quick and turn the double play when i just needed to make sure of one there
4941913 its definitely something you want to do but its not something you should think about when youre up there because then youll try to do too much
4941914 when i make an error im just kind of in this twilight zone where i dont know what im thinking but it was good to get that opportunity
4941915 but he made up for it the next inning with the big base hit to win the game
4941916 it was a tough game they came back we came back we continue to fight hopefully well continue the rest of the year
4941917 when you strike out manny to end the game you certainly earn the victory
4941918 i should have been at third base he cameron had a good jump on the ball and when i saw him go back on it i thought he was going to catch it he camped under it but i made a mistake and it cost us the game
4941919 i think he added to the levity of this group
4941920 over the past few years vessel arrivals in terms of shipping tonnage have registered double digit increase this new high in terms of timescale for the one billion breakthrough signals that 2008 may very well be another record breaking year for the singapore port all these achievements are possible because of the efforts put in by our port and maritime community in ensuring that singapore port continues to add value and provide quality services to the global shipping community
4941921 i just want to pitch and hopefully get better if i can get something out of this season and get better for next season thats a positive im not going to sit here and try and think if im a starter or not im just looking forward to the next opportunity to go out and pitch
4941922 this is a big step in the right direction for me
4941923 you have to look back on the positives you cant sit here and be negative the whole time the last three ive had some pretty rough ones but tonight im going to take the positives out of it
4941924 whether the guy was safe or out i thought kevin causey called the play way too soon
4941925 our family was here for almost 40 years and my grandfather has asked his inheritors to return here one day
4941926 i hope that in a few years time szczawnica will flourish and will return to its most glorious form
4941927 this is a great chance for the resort which was falling into disrepair and stagnation
4941928 the reconstruction by the inheritors is a chance to turn it back into a jewel
4941929 you can come here to repair your health and link that with an active vacation
4941930 its the third time we are here and we feel the treatment and the clean air really help
4941931 and its so peaceful here away from the big world
4941932 from here it is a continuation with my goal of raising the sport of swimming as high as i can in the us 70 000 fans will be watching the relay at the nfl ravens game tonight the team based in his home town of baltimore and it has been shown at sports events across the country
4941933 i have heard people say its crazy they are out to dinner and swimming is on the television
4941934 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
4941935 after the 200 im i started to think we could get there that was when i allowed myself to believe a little bit it was pretty exciting
4941936 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
4941937 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun

4941951 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
4941952 historically ebay charged for their apis ebay is announcing is that it will be removing all api fees for call volume and annual fees we are planning on building on current momentum by making the apis free allow developers to continue to build really wonderful innovative applications
4941953 we never charged for the apis for direct revenue it was always about efficiency when we got started making our apis broadly available 5 years ago it was not a foregone conclusion about what value our developers would drive and what it meant for our infrastructure
4941954 we want to do two things by making the apis free number one to all of our developers who have been with us for a number of years say thank you and the second is around new developers our motto is innovation without barriers we want to remove as many barriers as possible lets get rid of them and let developers do what they do best
4941955 today about 22 of ebay coms listings come from 3 rd party developers and that is up from 20 in q2
4941956 to make developers successful we have done a bunch of things we give them a lot of marketing support for example a solutions directory solutions ebay com an online directory where ebay buyers and sellers can find tools we also give them lots of technical support online as well as live help we also have a sandbox which is a replicated version of the ebay production environment which is available for ebay developers to test it before going live to site
4941957 terapeak takes ebays unstructured data and puts it in a structured format if you want to sell ipod nanos you can go to terapeaks system and get a wealth of information of historical transactions around average selling prices conversion rates on ipod nanos look at what time of day to sell what features like bold to use
4941958 mpire built a selling tool for ebay sellers it allows you as a seller to manage your ebay inventory and get a snapshot of how youre doing financially and allow you to manage your contacts
4941959 a lot of our sellers today dont even have to come to ebay to manage their business and we designed that intentionally on the buy side today we have a whole host of applications that allow you to sell more efficiently whether youre on the browser telephone etc
4941960 something im very excited to see is when you can search for an item and you can list an item on ebay without ever having to go to the website my belief is that will increase the size of the marketplace and thats a win win for everyone
4941961 for us its been less about buzz or hype and more about economic opportunity weve always focused around how can we make developers successful and how can they actually make money that doesnt always go hand in hand with the latest fad or the latest buzz
4941962 in our license agreement that is allowed and the one caveat is that with the listings from amazon and ebay must be visually separate the last thing you want is someone to click on an item thinking theyre going to ebay and go to some other site go to fatlens and you will see concert tickets there not only on ebay but also on various other marketplaces that fatlens does business with
4941963 im not going to give you all the information you like about what they should be doing because after all were going after the same developer mindshare

4941981 it has emerged that there is more to the botswana military juntas planned boycott of the sadc summit than the alleged protest over president mugabes legitimacy and attendance
4941982 sources in botswana say the reason for the planned boycott is that the junta is considering pulling out of sadc as a prelude to hosting the africom zimbabwe they say happens to be a convenient scapegoat for getting out of the block that has drawn the line on accommodating africom

4942004 it is a huge surprise to find evidence of a roadrunner like species darting around beneath the feet of cretaceous dinosaurs
4942005 whether or not there were any representatives of modern bird groups in the cretaceous is currently the subject of a lot of debate
4942006 but as research progresses we are finding more and more evidence that some cretaceous birds were very similar though not identical to modern birds shandongornipes is another surprising but very welcome example
4942007 if the tracks had been found in very recent deposits in north america we would have assumed they were made by the well known roadrunner
4942008 but finding them in the cretaceous of china long before even the nearest relatives of roadrunners had evolved makes us call them roadrunner like
4942009 but none run along the ground with long strides like the roadrunner and the bird that made the shandongornipes tracks
4942010 in fact this is the first zygodactyl track ever found anywhere in the fossil record
4942011 this means that the shandongornipes track maker was almost certainly not closely related to modern roadrunners but lived a roadrunner like lifestyle

4942014 theres usually a group of about 20 elderly people there so i find that quite sociable
4942015 this is the first wave of men coming out of the divorce generation
4942016 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given custody rights after a divorce
4942017 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children
4942018 men tend to have weaker social links and contact with family and friends
4942019 less comfortable with planning social interactions and knowing how to integrate themselves fully into society
4942020 many older people experience loneliness but men over the age of 80 who live alone as well as those who are recently bereaved are particularly at risk
4942021 i never did much around the house mainly a bit of hoovering and washing the car it was quite a challenge at first but i can do it all now

4942168 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
4942169 to me thats one of the most exciting things about all this
4942170 the greatest threat to our national security is our failure to properly educate every one of our children
4942171 im not sure he realized those were cameras i dont know
4942172 i havent talked to him i dont know what he was thinking at that point
4942173 the response we get from the public continues to show there is an interest in having this type of list brought to the attention of citizens of howard county
4942174 people thought it needed to have a place with the other historic sites in ellicott city that it could be a good addition to the tours given there
4942175 this system has rallied around these schools and has put the measures in place to help them succeed next year
4942176 all of these schools have successfully met our local standard of having 70 percent or more of their students scoring at proficient or above in both reading and mathematics
4942177 in most cases these schools missed ayp by only a few students
4942178 when i get there i stand in front of the food they tell me to and serve
4942179 en tout cas la nouvelle autorit du ps sera fond e sur la comp tence et la sinc rit
4942180 a ce jour martine aubry a sans doute pour le ps le meilleur profil
4942181 i cant do this anymore my work is too boring
4942182 these market leading projects we have in california are something that can be extrapolated around the world
4942183 if youre going to make a difference youve got to do it big
4942184 i would fight any one of the ufc lightweights but the problem is that i will never put my foot in the octagon after they ufc tried to be funny i would rather have bleeding the japanese mma audience is the best in the world they make magic i would rather have one true japanese mma supporter than one million fake mainstream supporters that will turn their back on you as soon as you lose a fight i dont care about things that are mainstream
4942185 i look at a lot of joe and jane consumers on main street anywhere and a lot of them are pretty content with just a regular cellphone
4942186 it does what they need it to do and basically that is just to make a phone call
4942187 theyre still going to remain in the minority mainly because these devices basically just arent for everyone
4942188 i think some companies will say blasphemy to this but not everyone is going to need a blackberry not everyone is going to need an iphone not everyone is going to need a palm treo
4942189 if a smart phone or a regular cellphone didnt make phone calls or didnt make phone calls well people would just switch their phones and say i am getting something else mainly because thats the intended purpose
4942190 obviously because canadians are such high users of voice its a pretty good indicator that we do like to talk
4942191 why do you keep asking me the same question again and again although i have told you so many times it is a crow are you not able to understand this
4942192 today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa when a crow was sitting on the window my son asked me 23 times what it was and i replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow i hugged him lovingly each time h e asked me the same question again and again for 23 times i did not at all feel irritated i rather felt affection for my innocent child
4942193 i want to see my parents happy forever they have cared for me ever since i was a little child they have always showered their selfless love on me they crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today
4942194 creativity is the process of having original ideas but there are several steps
4942195 konvoji su na putu od chinvalija prema rusiji ruski predsjednik dmitrij medvedev rekao je da se trebamo povu i
4942196 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4942197 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
4942198 earlier they had given resistance but afterward they had withdrawn
4942199 in illegal informal settlements there are a lot of social factors that come into being high on the list is drunkeness where a person drinks and forgets to put off the candle or they might leave a pot cooking on a stove and go and buy beer again
4942200 happiness does not heal but happiness protects against falling ill
4942201 the idea that there is a state called happiness and that we can dependably figure out what it feels like and how to measure it is extremely subversive
4942202 it allows economists to start thinking about life in richer terms to stop asking what did you buy and to start asking is your life good
4942203 for the time being we know that happiness fosters physical health but not precisely how
4942204 chronic unhappiness activates the fight flight response which is known to involve harmful effects in the long run such as higher blood pressure and a lower immune response
4942205 if we feel unhealthy we go to a medical general practitioner
4942206 if we feel unhappy there is no such generalist we have to guess
4942207 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4942208 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4942209 this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing swimming
4942210 i think its probably one of the greatest things sport in general has ever seen
4942211 the shame of it is other athletes arent going to realize how hard it is the world is fast in swimming right now the world was not fast when mark spitz did his seven
4942212 i just feel very privileged that i got to watch michael phelps win eight gold medals thats been the highlight of my olympics
4942213 when you come out and swim fast times people realize that it can be done
4942214 you set that bar a bit high and people are going to come with you
4942215 and it kind of makes the rest of us look like if we dont win a gold medal
4942216 i just dont even know how he holds himself together
4942217 doing all best times winning every race everything was accomplished that i wanted to do its been one fun week thats for sure
4942218 i want to be the first michael phelps not the second mark spitz
4942219 someone in gainesville who was active in the community called me and said what would you think about prince william naming a school after sam
4942220 and i said well i think thats a great honor but there must be other people who lived here longer or people who were born and reared here instead of my husband
4942221 im coming to the ribbon cutting out of great respect for vice admiral gravely and his widow mrs alma gravely the admiral was a role model whom i admired from afar i met him on a few occasions after he retired he was a striking figure who commanded respect with his towering character and intellect yet he was very humble he opened the door and inspired a generation of african american flag officers many are on active duty today
4942222 i dont think navy people go through that many school ribbon cuttings
4942223 this is a very significant event from the navy standpoint
4942224 there were people who didnt want to be on a ship with him there werent many blacks in the navy
4942225 one time he was taken to jail in key west florida for impersonating an officer he was an officer and he was in an officers uniform

4942228 our position is very clear that its up to the coalition and parliament to decide on the issue
4942229 if he resigns then there will be no need for the impeachment process
4942230 its not as though we can pull into the motorway services is it
4942231 kindly advised that some channels in the guest rooms will be temporarily shut down during the olympic games as per the request from the government unfortunately we have no control over the request

4942236 we have developed a new laboratory technique to measure ewing sarcoma tumor cells in the blood and bone marrow this method uses a machine called a flow cytometer to measure a specific protein known as cd99 on the surface of almost all ewing sarcoma tumor cells
4942237 in this study we plan to study 20 patients with ewing sarcoma over two years
4942238 we hope to show that this new flow cytometry method can find ewing sarcoma cells in these samples as accurately and effectively as the current pcr method in the future this technique may be useful to monitor the disease burden and effectiveness of therapy in ewing sarcoma

4942287 i was in a room at the red roof inn in albany n y and leyland called me he managed many years in the minor leagues
4942288 from that point on we went 52 28 and we won the whole thing we didnt go 52 28 because jim leyland called me but he was a big league manager and he took the time to recognize and understand what it was like for someone who was down in the trenches because he had been there
4942289 hes a tremendous baseball guy probably the guy who ive tried to emulate more than anybody
4942290 ive got to keep playing and do what i can and play 100 every day i dont set goals i think about playing hard every day and seeing what happens

4942305 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4942306 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
4942307 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4942308 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4942309 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4942310 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4942311 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me

4942316 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4942317 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4942318 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4942319 ive got plenty of time for world records in the future
4942320 im ready to kiss it goodbye if he keeps on doing what hes doing

4942322 ronnie drew passed away peacefully at 2pm today after a long illness with his family by his side the family would like to express their gratitude to
4942323 the family are very grateful for all the letters of support and good wishes during ronnies illness details of funeral arrangements will be announced in due course
4942324 death scares me but we all have a certain amount of time to live we all have to go some time its a killer disease and i dont know if i can beat it or not
4942325 it is with great sadness that i have learned of the death of ronnie drew
4942326 ronnie was a champion of traditional irish music and with the dubliners he re energised and refreshened our
4942327 ronnie will be greatly missed by many but most particularly by his family with whom our thoughts are today
4942328 he bore his final illness with great courage and great dignity he was a great source of humour and good cheer to other patients on the unit
4942329 he will be sadly missed as will his late wife
4942330 weddings funerals barmitzvahs thats what i loved about ronnie drews voice and spirit music to inspire to console an optimism that was contagious thats what u2 took from the dubliners
4942331 ronnie has left his earthly tour for one of the heavens they need him up there its a little too quiet and pious god is lonely for a voice louder than his own
4942332 a truly great man a great performer a great father and a great actor funnily enough although few would remember his performance in richards cork leg
4942333 it was 25 years ago they were down on their luck they came on the late late show to tell their story and we gave them the entire show from beginning to end
4942334 it is one of the classic messages of all time
4942335 ever since then we remained very good friends he was always in good form and he was one of those people you always left smiling
4942336 he was the brightest of the lot of them ronnie gave the impression most of the time as the wisecracking guy but in fact if anyone was asked to give a lecture on literature he would be the one who would do it best
4942337 he was a deep guy he worked things out for himself his wife deirdre was fantastic he wouldnt have gone beyond 50 if it wasnt for her
4942338 i think he kind of knew himself that it was getting closer
4942339 in his last days he made extraordinary efforts to be at different places to go to other peoples concerts and support them he worked very successfully through what i have considered a very difficult time of his life he was brave and noble in pursuit of his art in the end
4942340 i said to my wife when i saw ronnie that he wouldnt last long he couldnt really cope without her when ronnie was on the drink playing throughout
4942341 to me he was a pal for close on 40 years
4942342 but he was also of the old school i had dinner in my house last year for ronnie and a whole bunch of us from the old days and he was telling some bawdy story when geraldine my wife came into the room to see if we were all right and he stopped dead he was like that he wouldnt use bad language in front of a woman
4942343 his unique singing voice was loved by so many people
4942344 to me designing without colour is rather like boxing with one arm behind your back
4942345 buildings should express a sense of wonder and joy theres a reason im not an accountant or a lawyer who deals in doom and gloom architects should deal in joy and delight
4942346 the last thing we want is to create an air of indifference because then youve succeeded in making just another gray building which the world just doesnt need
4942347 pledge to the georgian people that youve got a solid friend in america
4942348 the past is no more and the future is not yet both are unnecessarily moving in directions which dont exist one used to exist but no longer exists and one has not even started to exist the only right person is one who lives moment to moment whose arrow is directed to the moment who is always here and now wherever he is his whole consciousness his whole being is involved in the reality of here and in the reality of now thats the only right direction only such a man can enter into the golden gate the present is the golden gate here now is the golden gate
4942349 this would impact on britain heavily with coastal erosion inland flooding with more heavy rainfall events and higher temperatures it would impact on many communities and householders and on what farmers could grow
4942350 there is a 50 probability that temperatures will exceed 2 degrees centigrade and a 20 probability they would exceed 3 5 degrees centigrade
4942351 when heavyweight advisers like professor bob watson who is a former science adviser to president clinton and ex chief scientist at the world bank and sir david king the governments former chief scientific adviser begin to talk in this range of figures then we have to pay attention
4942352 one of the big unknowns is the stage at which dangerous tipping points would be reached which accelerate the warming process still further the release of methane hydrate deposits in the arctic could be triggered by temperature increases and these could lead to a further cycle of even higher temperatures
4942353 this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing swimming
4942354 i think in terms of just sheer dominance in his events
4942355 earlier they had given resistance but afterward they had withdrawn
4942356 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4942357 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4942358 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4942359 the accounting books and computers we obtained could help with clarifying the case

4942366 some dignitaries have arrived here to mediate a saudi royal air force plane is parked at chaklala air base so the matter could be a day or two
4942367 some foreign dignitaries might have arrived but we dont know and none of the foreign visitors contacted mr zardari
4942368 our position is very clear that its up to the coalition and parliament to decide on the issue
4942369 if he resigns then there will be no need for the impeachment process
4942370 recent news that 12 beaches in northern ireland have been criticised for low water quality due to spillage from sewage overflow pipes confirms the urgent and pressing need for a truly independent environmental protection agency in the province the only part of the uk not to have one
4942371 the dup seem to think that by re labelling half the civil servants in the environment department the northern ireland environment agency they will somehow defuse demands for better environmental protection here this is real ostrich style head in the sand stuff from the dup do they really think people care so little about the environment that they will accept this kind of conjuring trick from the dup
4942372 it has now emerged that newcastle has three unauthorised sewage overflow outlets and failed the eus basic water quality standards last year it has also been revealed that ballyholme and carnlough also saw a decline in beach cleanliness and failed the basic water quality standards there is no limit on the amount of sewage that can come out of these overflows it appears they represent a licence to pollute

4942374 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4942375 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4942376 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4942377 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4942378 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4942379 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further
4942380 it will be well into 2009 before the market works off all the excesses accumulated during the housing boom

4942391 i welcome this indication that an incoming conservative administration will consider legislating against double jobbing
4942392 there is of course the fact that this problem particularly afflicts northern ireland
4942393 our fellow citizens in scotland and wales do not suffer from this plague of double jobbers nor should we in this part of the united kingdom
4942394 this morning i personally visited each of the five orange halls which had been attacked overnight tassagh aghavilly tannagh hill ballyrea and crosskeys i have spoken to the local lodge officials regarding the incident and to the police who are now investigating the attacks this sort of sectarian behaviour must be utterly condemned and those responsible have no place in northern ireland society
4942395 to me these look like sustained and coordinated sectarian attacks disturbingly some of the messages were also extremely sinister with we havent gone away you know appearing on a number of the halls
4942396 sectarian attacks like these have no place in civilised society they only serve to raise public tension unnecessarily i would therefore challenge the sinn fein leadership and ask that they too condemn these attacks on our local orange halls
4942397 extended school funding had enabled primary schools in areas of need to provide breakfast clubs after school clubs and other additional activity the minister of education has significantly reduced the extended school funding during 2008 2009 and east antrim has been particularly significantly affected i have written to the minister seeking an explanation as why funding in this area is down by almost 2 3 of the funding that was provided in 2007 2008

4942402 editors the world over will be simply unable to provide readers with the information they have come to expect in the instant news epoch
4942403 fifa has reduced the publication time delay from two hours to one after wans representations
4942404 this is a move in the right direction but not yet good enough we dont see any rational reason for any time restrictions at all
4942405 this is not a question of live broadcast content nor are we challenging the right of fifa to sell licensing rights
4942406 the immediate publication of still images in no way effects these rights we hope to convince fifa and all other international sports organizations that are considering similar rules that it is in their best interests to allow the free flow of information from their games
4942407 fifa should not forget that newspapers have made a historic contribution to the popularity and development of football world wide and continues to do so
4942408 the media industry has moved in a big way into the digital world all media need to recognize this
4942409 the media industry has changed more in the past 8 years than in the previous 80 because of broadband
4942410 newspaper companies will not be able to resist digital media they need to embrace it
4942411 we look at our end user as the consumer audience not the mass audience reuters is targeting people who find news valuable investors business professionals globally engaged citizens
4942412 the more successful search engines are the more successful well all be because it will be easier to find news
4942413 citizen journalism is having a fundamental impact on the way we do our jobs trust in the media is being tested and bloggers are holding traditional media to account weve become somewhat elitist the old broadcast model of telling the world what news they should pay attention to is obsolete
4942414 a community of news users where the news user can become your partner
4942415 a great opportunity for our journalism in terms of transparency

4942422 visiting charleston with best friend of 30 years to celebrate her 50th birthday what cooler thing to do on your 50th birthday than to bed jump
4942423 we stayed at palma for the business and in the evening we relaxed well as you can see
4942424 i came to tijuana to this nice hotel and couldnt resist
4942425 everytime i go to a hotel i have to get a picture like this
4942426 it was a good race for us today i knew we had a good motorbike in the rockstar makita suzuki gsxr1000 and i was able to rely on it i know ben likes to get the lead and put his head down but we had something for him today in qualifying i felt like i left a few tenths out there and it seemed like i was able to find at least one of them at the start of the race we had a few problems at the beginning of the year but we have been able to get those sorted and id like to thank my guys for putting in the hard work what else can you say about the rockstar makita suzuki team going one two three we just want to get out there and race as hard as we can
4942427 i was pushing as hard as i could to stay with mat and i lost the rear and i was just happy i was able to hang on after that i couldnt get back into a rhythm again i tried to hang on to him but we just didnt have the speed today i knew i had a good gap on third place and there was no reason to do anything silly we did everything we could and settled into second place im happy that we were able to get the rockstar makita suzuki on the podium one two three and hopefully we can find a little more for tomorrow
4942428 its been a long road since i was on the podium last time todays race went well i got a good start on the rockstar makita suzuki gsx r1000 and got the holeshot for about a minute i tried to latch on to my team mates but those guys got away from me pretty quick i had a battle for third going for a while until about 10 laps to go and then after that it was a pretty uneventful race its good to be back on the podium again

4942432 the doctor said well it looks like hes got all the symptoms of west nile virus
4942433 i called the state health department because i needed to know how long he was going to be sick
4942434 i was just bawling i thought he was going to die
4942435 he was diagnosed with epstein barr virus which is pretty much the same thing but you dont die from it
4942436 i dont blame him because all the doctors are doing it
4942437 id like to know how many people have been told they have west nile
4942438 this has been going on since west nile came into utah some doctors will base things on symptoms and not do tests
4942439 like any medical test they can be expensive and if people dont have insurance then sometimes the doctor will go ahead and try to help the patient
4942440 whether theyre helping or not may be something of a question
4942441 he said well it sounds like youve got west nile
4942442 it was really strange it was just contradictory to what we had heard on the news and what seemed to be happening everywhere
4942443 i ended up going to the doctor in the springtime
4942444 they found out that i was really anemic the question i have now is did i ever really have it am i immune to it am i going to get it again
4942445 people who have been told they have it are out on the lake not really worrying about it
4942446 i cant imagine how many people have been told that
4942447 maybe theres something seriously wrong that they dont know about and they say nah its west nile
4942448 we try to do education for physicians and stuff like that thats the best we can do is try to educate people of what tests to draw and those kinds of things
4942449 thats the only way to tell for sure if theres west nile

4942466 i remember the first formula one test that i did in valencia in 2000
4942467 being a street track it will have that extra bit of flair and it will be a real buzz for the drivers to learn a new track it will be dusty to start with so they will need to increase their speed steadily because the barriers will be very unforgiving i really like street circuits and it would be cool to be racing this weekend
4942468 i raced at valencia the weekend before the hungarian grand prix in a gt sportscar
4942469 theres a small bump as you go on and off the astilleros bridge which could unsettle the cars in the wet and then theres a 90 degree right before the track drops away and you head down a long curved straight
4942470 you brake really hard for turn 12 and it is here that it feels most like a street circuit because there are traffic lights hanging across the track and you can see buildings

4942482 the media seems preoccupied at the moment about peoples dna being stored centrally but the reality is that the database is really a one dimensional invasion of citizens privacy
4942483 two dimensional databases such as the planned telecommunications database of the numbers that people call from their landlines and mobile phones are much more worrying
4942484 not only do you have the numbers called and the locations called from but you have a time based diary from which you can extrapolate their movements
4942485 this has been a highly charged subject for years not least due to the progressive extension of the scope of the database culminating in recent proposals to include young children who might offend in the future or indeed everyone in the country

4942492 the key to local newspapers survival is their ability to get money from small local advertisers local classified ads are a sizable source of revenue as well papers get those ads because the papers cover local news and so attract local readers advertisers dont have to spend money trying to reach people who cant buy their goods but googles wifi service can make that kind of local targeting look crude it will be able to deliver ads literally on a block by block basis it could deliver localized classified ads as well which are the financial mainstay of many local papers
4942493 googles grand ambition to get san franciscans onto the internet for free as altruistic as it sounds is really about targeted advertisements
4942494 theres a huge fissure within big media some get some dont and some never will
4942495 a one way broadcaster to a moderator to a facilitator
4942496 the russian authorities have solved the problem quite cleverly from their perspective
4942497 in russia the effect of what you publish is different from in the west nothing happens
4942498 inevitably mafiosi and oligarchs have become interested along the way
4942499 the trends are not exactly what we would like but i think the reports of prints death are greatly exaggerated
4942500 the trends are not exactly what we would like but i think the reports of prints death are greatly exaggerated
4942501 the newspaper business is in a horrible state its not that papers dont make money they make plenty but not many people or at least not many on wall street see a future in them in an attempt to leave the forest of dead trees and reach the high plains of digital media every paper in the country is struggling mightily to digitize its content with web sites blogs video and podcasts but what the newspaper industry really needs is an ipod moment
4942502 a device for data consumption that is uplinked and updated constantly a digital player for the eyes with an itunes like array of content available at a ubiquitous volume and a low digestible price
4942503 it looks simple to come up with a tablet that works but it is not in order to have the power and portability you need you need power the screen is the part of the device that uses the most power
4942504 because there is no scarcity of ad space on the web you cannot charge nearly so much for a banner ad on a page with millions of hits as you can for a double page spread in a national paper
4942505 as itunes has demonstrated there is a vast swath of consumers who are willing to pay for what they want and avoid the moral taint of unauthorized use that is the future that newspapers have to prepare for readers no longer care so much who you are they just want to know what you know
4942506 were not saying people shouldnt look at circulation but we want to be sure we get the full credit for what newspapers have to offer
4942507 for too long however newspapers only came in one form ink on paper suddenly all of that has changed newspapers still arrive the traditional way but they also come in compact and tab sizes they now offer free editions targeted editions and editions in languages other than english theyve gone digital and now arrive 24 hours a day seven days a week via online sites the newspaper business is at the dawn of a renaissance
4942508 do i believe this is going to increase newspaper ad share probably not youre competing with people in tv and the internet who measure results every day twice a year wont be adequate
4942509 the internet has had an impact on the all media channels including the television and magazine publishing industries but it has had even more profound effects on the newspaper industry it undercuts newspapers revenue sources instead of subscription and purchase people are turning to the net or tv for up to the nanosecond news they tend to go online to research products and compare prices from multiple retailers instead of reading newspapers display ads and they are listing items for sale and looking for items to buy on electronic counterparts of the classifieds section in areas where two way digital television becomes a force it too is likely to cause consumer usage of newspapers to decline
4942510 convenience is the primary reason respondents gave for using rss feeds
4942511 not only do rss users visit more news web sites than non users they also visit those sites more frequently
4942512 journalists face libel laws whereas some bloggers behave as if theyre in the wild west bloggers will state things without saying where they got them from and increasingly blogs are used to promote products without making this clear
4942513 weblogs are not about content but about sharing learning and connecting with other people
4942514 people have little time and want to be reasonably confident that the sites they visit are reliable whereas a lot of weblogs are tripe
4942515 the exciting thing about weblogs however is that they have reinvigorated the debate about journalistic methods and ethics a debate long overdue
4942516 journalists face libel laws whereas some bloggers behave as if theyre in the wild west bloggers will state things without saying where they got them from and increasingly blogs are used to promote products without making this clear
4942517 what i picked up from this pile of e mail is that many people view the times columnists as fulfilling an important global public service role and that by publishing them freely on the web for so many years they spread ideas around the world that need to be read widely the times is being judged on its mission of serving the public good not shareholders something the times may have damaged here is its global impact

4942524 broadly speaking there are three factors that need to be considered by the print media the consumers need for uninterrupted entertainment the advertisers need to reach out to its tg and the need of the medium to deliver relevant content
4942525 differentiated content is crucial for newspapers the ones who achieve it are the only ones that will survive
4942526 the future of newspapers will be to offer local news and the main challenge will be to make sure that the local news does not go down the road of local irrelevance
4942527 according to me the real challenge faced by newspapers today is how to marry credibility with commerce it is how to survive in the business and at the same time be able to grab the attention of those whom one is addressing
4942528 broadly speaking there are three factors that need to be considered by the print media the consumers need for uninterrupted entertainment the advertisers need to reach out to its tg and the need of the medium to deliver relevant content

4942533 the biggest thing is just how wide the track is
4942534 its so wide that there are a lot of options for drivers which line they want to run
4942535 even though its a big racetrack it has no grip
4942536 the grip level is really low its a really really slick racetrack so you have all these options to run in but the cars are sliding all around
4942537 to go 200 mph on an approach into a corner without any grip is an interesting experience
4942538 every track is unique so i try not to get into a habit of trying to drive michigan the same way i drive california
4942539 i try to prepare myself for every racetrack a little differently i watch a lot of videotapes and ill go back and read a lot of the notes i made from the prior race

4942566 it was a bit like new york city suddenly coming online overnight
4942567 someone lifted a curtain and there was this gleaming city full of people who wanted to spend money on wine
4942568 i came over in march which was just after the duty cut and thought well heres an opportunity lets do it now
4942569 i would actually argue that hong kong is already the wine trading centre for asia up to 23 percent of all wine sold at auction internationally is sold to hong kong buyers but the effect of the duty cut has been dramatic
4942570 within the first three or four days we had 10 container loads of rare and fine wine confirmed to be shipped over we had prepared by opening a second facility and are currently opening our third to cater for wines coming in
4942571 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
4942572 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
4942573 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
4942574 theyre huge buyers of classified growth of the latours and the lafites but theyre not saving it

4942579 she just said congratulations and then she started crying and i started crying and then my sister started crying we havent really had too much time together
4942580 my mums told me id better make the team because she wants to go to rome so ive got the pressure from the mum

4942610 a great city so why in hell would they want to screw it up by turning it into a suburb
4942611 have you noticed how obsessed city hall is with garbage
4942612 the city spends a lot of time worrying about garbage that goes into big open pits in the middle of essentially nowhere
4942613 im not into all this fancy upper class suburban stuff
4942614 these guys running seattle now are basically dan evans style republicans they think theyre setting national environmental policy and that it will get them on the front page of the new york times
4942615 but is there any pressing reason to do anything different with our garbage is it worth continuing to drive lower income people out of the city

4942618 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4942619 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4942620 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4942621 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4942622 let me tell you about the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees and a thing called love
4942623 the recruiters have been ringing their phones off the hook

4942626 they did not want to turn this into a swiss company
4942627 if arts still in the chair i think that relieves a huge amount of anxiety
4942628 when i was there we took great pride in stiff arming the roche people
4942629 i found them to be classic arrogant big pharma guys
4942630 i dissent from the view that there will be a mass exodus
4942631 in all honesty youre losing one of the great training grounds for the next generation of entrepreneurs and scientists
4942632 history would suggest that it will be very difficult for roche to keep the same vibrancy of innovation that genentech saw under an independent structure
4942633 you just have to reflect at least a bit about the legacy of genentech and the scientific patina it established for the bay area
4942634 i hope thats true for them and selfishly for the patina of the industry as a whole
4942635 were keeping an eye out for that lighter colored fruit

4942637 its one of those overnight success stories that never quite happen overnight
4942638 but it is one fortuitous event the survey of the chinese athletes that made a difference and made a fit for us
4942639 im not so concerned about the volume we are shipping to beijing
4942640 but i am really excited about the symbolic gesture of cooperation between california growers and the government of china
4942641 this may not be a world crisis issue but there was a need a demand the chinese people requested something to be a part of their diet the chinese government took that seriously and worked with us to make it happen

4942644 in france we lost the culture of the bike after the war when it was seen as old fashioned or for poor people

4942647 they were always the hometown airline they were in the downtown parades they invested in the community

4942650 we have a few airports out there that i think are spending more than they should quite frankly and so there are some real total airport cost increases that we are very vocal about

4942654 ketika itulah tuhan allah membentuk manusia itu dari debu tanah dan menghembuskan nafas hidup ke dalam hidungnya demikianlah manusia itu menjadi makhluk yang hidup
4942655 terjemahan baru lai atau terjemahan alkitab bis memberikan pengertian yang lebih jelas
4942656 kejadian 6 5 6 tetapi yang menarik di dalam setiap kejahatan yang manusia lakukan tuhan tetap menyediakan sekelompok sisa remnant yang masih setia kepada tuhan
4942657 nuh bisa mendapatkan anugerah tuhan itu semata mata karena kedaulatan nya saja bukan karena kehendak nuh yang ingin mencari tuhan
4942658 bisa saja pada waktu itu nuh tidak menaati tuhan lalu berdalih dengan seribu macam alasan akibatnya nuh itu mati bersama orang orang sezamannya
4942659 dikutip dari ulangan 8 3 hidup manusia bukan sekedar makan minum bersenang senang tetapi hidup manusia itu berasal dari allah atau lebih tepatnya dari setiap firman allah
4942660 lalu di dalam pasal yang sama di ayat 1 10
4942661 hidup manusia sudah ada di tangan nya karena ia lah yang mengaturnya tetapi seringkali di dalam hidup manusia seringkali kuatir akan makanan minuman pakaian dll mengapa
4942662 anak anak tuhan tidak perlu kuatir karena kalau mereka kuatir mereka sama halnya dengan bangsa bangsa manusia yang tidak mengenal allah
4942663 kalau kita tidak perlu kuatir tidak berarti kita tidak memiliki kesusahan apapun tetapi kristus berkata bahwa kesusahan itu masih tetap ada tetapi biarkanlah kesusahan itu cukup untuk sehari jangan ditambahi dengan kekuatiran yang tidak perlu
4942664 itu adalah bonus atau akibat setelah kita mempercayakan diri kepada nya dengan mencari kerajaan allah dan kebenarannya mengutamakan nya sebagai tuhan dan raja dalam hidup kita jangan sembarangan menafsirkan alkitab
4942665 pada waktu itu datanglah murid murid itu kepada yesus dan bertanya
4942666 aku berkata kepadamu sesungguhnya jika kamu tidak bertobat dan menjadi seperti anak kecil ini kamu tidak akan masuk ke dalam kerajaan sorga sedangkan barangsiapa merendahkan diri dan menjadi seperti anak kecil ini dialah yang terbesar dalam kerajaan sorga dan barangsiapa menyambut seorang anak seperti ini dalam nama ku ia menyambut aku
4942667 tetapi barangsiapa menyesatkan salah satu dari anak anak kecil ini yang percaya kepada ku lebih baik baginya jika sebuah batu kilangan diikatkan pada lehernya lalu ia ditenggelamkan ke dalam laut
4942668 masuk ke dalam jika tanganmu atau kakimu menyesatkan engkau penggallah dan buanglah itu karena lebih baik bagimu masuk ke dalam hidup dengan tangan kudung atau timpang dari pada dengan utuh kedua tangan dan kedua kakimu dicampakkan ke dalam api kekal dan jika matamu menyesatkan engkau cungkillah dan buanglah itu karena lebih baik bagimu masuk ke dalam hidup dengan bermata satu dari pada dicampakkan ke dalam api neraka dengan bermata dua hidup
4942669 orang orang dunia pasti kesulitan membaca ayat ini karena mereka pasti berpikir bahwa kalau kita kehilangan sesuatu pasti kita tidak bisa hidup
4942670 inilah pengharapan anak anak tuhan di mana mereka akan menerima mahkota kemuliaan setelah mereka menderita aniaya
4942671 orang yang percaya kepada allah sehingga hubungannya dengan allah menjadi baik kembali orang itu akan hidup
4942672 di dalam yohanes 12 25 alkitab bis mengartikan dengan lebih jelas

4942842 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
4942843 she played such a big role in my life and was such an inspiration to me
4942844 she raised me as a young man for 13 years of my life i loved being around her i would go to school and rush home just to be around my mom
4942845 im very happy no 20 was available in houston i was going to have to go to my college number 5
4942846 hes got a lot to learn hes a kid getting into a grown mans game
4942847 they compared him and he accepted that but hes his own player

4942853 roc o san miguel coordinadora de control ciudadano asegura que la ley habilitante permiti a los militares actuar sin una legislaci n que regule la materia
4942854 a trav s de la ley habilitante el gobierno adelant otra fase de su proyecto socialista
4942855 organizar planificar dirigir y controlar el sistema de inteligencia militar y contrainteligencia militar
4942856 en la pr ctica ello implica que el ministerio de la defensa podr adelantar labores de inteligencia y contrainteligencia sin ning n tipo de control tal como figura en el art culo 4 de la nueva ley se trata de una norma abierta desaparece la coletilla de conformidad con la ley eso es muy peligroso porque hasta el gobierno hab a convenido en la necesidad de evitar excesos cuando se invoca la seguridad del estado para justificar la intromisi n oficial en la vida privada de los ciudadanos
4942857 en ese momento el objetivo era obstaculizar las manifestaciones p blicas contra el gobierno mediante la restricci n del derecho al libre tr nsito pero la ley con la cual se regul la materia incluye sanciones que alcanzan la prisi n hasta por diez a os por ejemplo ah est el caso del general carlos alfonso mart nez
4942858 un funcionario p blico no se podr a negar a este tipo de labores so pena de perder el trabajo de esta forma el servicio militar no ser a tan voluntario
4942859 i was just thinking how proud i am to be canadian
4942860 and i was just thinking about the road to how i got here its been a long one but a good one
4942861 they worked so hard for us to have a better life theres five of us kids that they had to raise and support
4942862 im really proud of it and scott is really proud of it
4942863 the australians had a great push through the middle we pushed back a little bit but congratulations to them they definitely deserved that
4942864 on behalf of the government of canada and all canadians i would like to congratulate carol huynh david calder scott frandsen and tonya verbeek for their exceptional accomplishments
4942865 canada is delighted to see them standing tall on the podium with the worlds best athletes
4942866 we are extremely proud of canadas olympic team competing in beijing each day our athletes exhibit dignity respect and dedication to their sport and to their country
4942867 i thought we played well and hit hard but unfortunately we could not find the holes
4942868 they made some big plays and we just could not get any runs across
4942869 i mean i knew i could ride a top eight if i rode a good race for me but if i rode a perfect race it would be a top five
4942870 we played well three of the four quarters but greece scored five goals in the first
4942871 we cant give up such a big lead in an olympic tournament
4942872 as if their objective was to turn tom brady into a prolific fantasy qb
4942873 they are certainly on the radar in terms of making sure that whatever we do were able to accommodate
4942874 we have been familiar with the issue since the beginning of the mainland common project and will be addressing it in our detailed design
4942875 there will be lots of glass to help promote the aquatics centre as a vibrant and active space and this is obviously the opposite of the muslim womens requirements
4942876 to cover the pool windows with this type of automatic blind will be costly probably in the thousands of dollars
4942877 i have asked for an estimate and im hoping we will be able to get a sponsor who will consider providing funds for these blinds in lieu of an acknowledgment of their contribution
4942878 in islamic traditional teachings it is one of the most important sports that we should learn and that we should teach our kids
4942879 we are taxpayers and we should have services like everyone else i think the new facility should be inclusive whether its for women or muslims or people with disabilities
4942880 we have been blocking off the windows with paper or bags or whatever so folks coming into the facility wouldnt be able to see straight through
4942881 we have already spoken to ms wile about some specific fundraising needed since it will probably mean an extensive use of motorized blackout blinds to the glass inside and out
4942882 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4942883 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4942884 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4942885 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4942886 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4942887 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4942888 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4942889 i sat on the board of a bank and i lasted only six months because it was a show and tell board management if you sit there and everything is good news you dont need me right
4942890 albany diocese defrocks priest accused of molesting boys in the 1980s
4942891 tests show legionnaires disease bacteria found in hot water system
4942892 if it seems that i can see farther than most men its because ive stood on the shoulders of giants
4942893 i know theres tremendous expectations here for what you would like to accomplish with this football program i can tell you that however you feel about it i have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish i want to win every game we play
4942894 today is the tomorrow i was so worried about yesterday
4942895 i know theres tremendous expectations here for what you would like to accomplish with this football program i can tell you that however you feel about it i have even higher expectations for what we want to accomplish i want to win every game we play
4942896 why should i praise people when theyre only doing what theyre paid to do
4942897 i just want to hug my mom spend some time with my family and lie in my own bed and relax if just for ten minutes
4942898 when i went to her after the victory ceremony she just started crying and then my sister started crying and then i started crying
4942899 i never wanted to be the second mark spitz i always wanted to be the first michael phelps
4942900 i am thankful for him having done what he did
4942901 after the semi final of the 100m butterfly i was going through the mixed zone and i thought oh my gosh i am really tired
4942902 after every final i was tested at a few heats in the run up to the olympics
4942903 and then i am going to take a vacation where i just sit around
4942904 i will definitely be returning to my hometown of baltimore
4942905 my mom has told me to better make the team for rome because she wants to go there
4942906 so now i have my moms pressure and i have to make sure that she can go there
4942907 i think this has just been the best week of my whole life

4942928 you are just a sweet person when a friend needs a shoulder to cry on you are happy to offer yours with a box of tissues as well once in awhile you wish you could be a little more dramatic but then sensibility sets back in and you know that you are perfect the way you are

4942931 alan collins along with his colleague mark temple of ozannes in st helier are working on the haut de la garenne case in
4942932 there is a link between the two cases in that a victim who was in the councils care was sent she alleges to haut de la garenne for a summer holiday only to be abused whilst there
4942933 most of the jewish residents of israel are of the same stock as of the jews of georgia
4942934 could the israelis and their treasonous agents in the united states have done a deal with the russians to set georgia up to give the russians a perfect excuse to attack georgia in return for russia cutting back on its sales of defensive arms to the middle east
4942935 the study replicated in four different labs found that homeopathic solutions so dilute that they probably didnt contain a single histamine molecule worked just like histamine
4942936 as michel collon recently reported bolivia eliminating its fiscal deficit has repaid half of its foreign debt now down from 5
4942937 the mushawarat asked the central government to probe the role of the navi mumbai based american national a former american soldier from whose computer the so called indian mujahidin email was sent this dubious character should not be allowed to leave the country before an exhaustive probe is completed if he is allowed to leave our shores it will be a shameful replay of the nda governments release of the foreign detainees in the purulia arms drop it said
4942938 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4942939 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
4942940 people talk of global warming but dont go out and do anything about it
4942941 i only plant trees that are strong have long life provide shade and are useful to society they should impede neither traffic nor pedestrians
4942942 just planting a tree and taking a photo with it is a very immature act if you want to grow a useful healthy tree you need to be willing to spend rs 1 500 to rs 2 000 per tree and two to three years tending to it till it becomes stable and strong
4942943 you have to examine the soil prepare the hole and only then plant a sapling
4942944 we made many mistakes and spent a lot of money before we learnt the right way to grow healthy trees
4942945 you can learn a lot from just growing one tree i always say trees are the best friend of man but man is the worst enemy of trees
4942946 people from adyar and tiruvanmiyur who are travelling to puducherry cuddalore and further south had to go all the way to the north of the city to koyambedu to get their bus that made no sense wasting all that fuel and time
4942947 this reduces traffic congestion and fuel use and also saves time
4942948 i believe you should go out and do what you can rather than just complain or tell other people how to do the job he says
4942949 are just looking for the place that gives them the best bang for their buck
4942950 the amenities and personal services at grigio were the main reason i chose to live here
4942951 what separates us from buying an apartment somewhere else in the city is they do have access to those services
4942952 even at the very highest gas prices in massachusetts i couldnt get more than 80 in it
4942953 what i now realize is that remaining close to home has huge advantages we live in the beautiful annapolis valley where tourists constantly stop to take pictures of the view we have from our living room most every day
4942954 we live in a fantastic province with gorgeous shorelines and scenery the best things in life are close to home for me
4942955 the trip will consist of visiting white sandy beaches found on the south shore such as crescent beach in lunenburg and carters beach in port mouton
4942956 i was told that these beaches are comparable to ones found down south minus the palm trees and fruity drinks of course
4942957 my son and i might even find an undiscovered fossil species how cool would that be
4942958 as many of the provinces 120 salt water beaches as we can cram in
4942959 the rugged beauty of lawrencetown beach attracts international surfers as well as local visitors and it will be the first on our list of things to do
4942960 we are looking forward to a trip to the sunrise trail on the northumberland strait and swimming in the warm waters of melmerby beach
4942961 many of our beaches are located in provincial parks so we will take advantage of the picnic and rest areas instead of eating at fast food outlets
4942962 we wait all year long for the summer so weve decided this year we are staying put
4942963 being maritimers we appreciate any time that its sunny were planning on taking day trips possibly deep sea fishing tidal bore rafting a trip to macnabs island
4942964 leau peut agir sur le poisson mais le poisson ne peut agir sur leau
4942965 given the enormous benefits we have seen from a lightly regulated internet and software market our government should refrain from imposing burdensome regulation
4942966 john mccain will focus on policies that leave consumers free to access the content they choose free to use the applications and services they choose free to attach devices they choose if they do not harm the network and free to chose among broadband service providers
4942967 while the internet has provided tremendous opportunity for the creators of copyrighted works including music and movies to distribute their works around the world at low cost it has also given rise to a global epidemic of piracy
4942968 john mccain supports efforts to crack down on piracy both on the internet and off
4942969 creemos que estos problemas son t picos de un chipset inmaduro no probado en grandes cantidades fuera de un laboratorio
4942970 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4942971 i dont have good finishes at those racetracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4942972 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4942973 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4942974 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4942975 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4942976 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save
4942977 you cant tell the driver to save fuel with five laps to go in the race the information has to be fed to a driver as soon as that run starts
4942978 look were on the edge here the only way to save fuel is to go slower you deaccelerate sooner youre off the throttle sooner youre on the throttle later and youre on the throttle less aggressively
4942979 by the way you still have to make reasonable lap times in most cases
4942980 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4942981 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4942982 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4942983 if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how
4942984 we used e mail the modern way of recording i could spend as long as i wanted on the music and he wasnt under any pressure to do something with me sitting there drumming my fingers
4942985 this groove is out of fashion these beats are 20 years old
4942986 i think minor chords fill in too much of the picture already
4942987 they push you into a certain place you can make major chords sound sad but you can never make minor chords sound happy
4942988 im always thinking about it but not overtly that might frighten me probably like a lot of people i feel alienated from the traditional models that were presented when i was a child and eventually i left those and said that doesnt seem relevant to me but i like a lot of people felt that as human beings we have some longing for transcending things in some way shape or form
4942989 i thought if i can write lyrics that emphasize that kind of uplift but then express the other stuff thats going on as well then it will seem like the music and the words and all the other stuff all belong together and came out of one mind as opposed to being artificially stuck together
4942990 there were things that i didnt think belonged in the same family at all
4942991 i was surprised david could make songs out of them
4942992 i might send you a track of the sound of a cheese grater
4942993 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4942994 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4942995 estaba muy nervioso quer a comenzar bien y llegar a la meta lo m s fuerte posible
4942996 sin duda habr a sido algo notable si no lo logr bamos
4942997 pero no es como que ten amos presi n de nadar por mike quer amos hacer esto no s lo por mike sino por nosotros
4942998 well why didnt you tell me that in the first place instead of writing some vague power steering leak
4942999 leila here i am pick me up buy me it seemed to be saying to me
4943000 cuba es un rival muy fuerte pero nos conocemos mucho y tenemos un juego parecido eso nos ayud a ubicarnos bien en la defensa y lucir mejor que en los juegos anteriores
4943001 el equipo es joven vinimos a aprender a acumular partidos e informaci n de los contrarios nunca hab amos jugado contra un equipo asi tico y fue positivo ver en la cancha la velocidad con la que juegan y que nos resulta dif cil sortear
4943002 es id neo jugar con estos grandes equipos una lecci n de v leibol de hecho aqu sentimos la falta de fogueo internacional pues llegamos con apenas dos partidos de preparaci n contra argelia
4943003 pero tendr a que ser un poco m s longevo para ser nombrado el mejor deportista ol mpico de todos los tiempos
4943004 its the first thing that everyone mentions the thing that everyone wants to know about him isnt that peculiar they say but i dont know that it is that peculiar
4943005 a lot of it makes an awful lot of sense and a lot of movie directors that ive worked with work in a similar way
4943006 for instance i never sat down and had a big conversation about my character with christopher nolan
4943007 im not trivializing it woody is certainly an eccentric individual but i think theres an awful lot of nonsense thats cooked up around the cult of woody allen
4943008 we got there and we didnt really know what we were going to do with it
4943009 the good thing is that woody shoots all of the exploratory stuff
4943010 because theres nothing worse than doing that thing where you rehearse something and something good happens and then you all sit around and go and that was great wasnt it that thing that happened
4943011 it never works so i appreciate the fact that he shoots all that working out stuff
4943012 and we did it for a long time that scene and we worked it in lots of different ways and we shot it in lots of different ways and i think whats finally there is a mishmash of things that we tried out but it was written so brilliantly that scene that it would have worked anyway
4943013 ive lived in england my whole life but my mothers from detroit
4943014 i essentially can be american as much as i can be english
4943015 its not a light decision at all to go into something that all of your family does for obvious reasons
4943016 and there was definitely a stage where i didnt tell anyone that i wanted to act even though i might have wanted to somewhere deep down my rebellion didnt really amount to much apart from wandering around at family parties and telling everyone i was going to be a painter
4943017 thats the thing if i was going to rebel properly i would have had to have been a banker or a rocket scientist but that side of my brain was not functioning at all
4943018 without wanting to come over all sort of feminist about it its just brilliant to watch a female director because there arent many of them around unfortunately she has a knack of just commanding everyones respect whilst being very witty and brilliant
4943019 its about two neighboring apartments in a building in downtown new york
4943020 catherine keener and her husband oliver platt and their 15 year old daughter live in one and the other one is home to a woman in her 90s who has two grandchildren who are me and amanda peet were sort of caring for her
4943021 when youre a 14 year old and youre fantasizing about where your lifes going to go i sat around fantasizing about playing a particular type of woody allen american heroine in a particular type of romantic bittersweet funny woody allen film
4943022 and suddenly i was sitting there with it in my lap is this really happening its very peculiar
4943023 but then youre set with a whole other set of problems
4943024 you know be careful what you wish for youve got to live up to your own expectations of yourself which is always a nightmare
4943025 si seulement 1 des pc utilisaient edison limpact potentiel sur lenvironnement pourrait tre de 7 millions de livres de co2 3 1 millions de tonnes ndlr mises en moins ce qui revient retirer un demi million de voitures de la circulation
4943026 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered
4943027 i cannot be in a room with a latex glove
4943028 everyone i know wanted tickets we chinese love to see sports
4943029 its a pity there are so many empty seats we would like to know who is responsible
4943030 this is our fourth olympics but getting tickets to this one really has been a nightmare
4943031 then you get inside and you wonder who got all the tickets because there is nobody there
4943032 all the tickets have been sold out we will be encouraging all the ticket holders to watch the matches themselves
4943033 if they dont want to go they should give the tickets to those who do
4943034 i know where our seats are the people who bought our tickets are attending
4943035 ive been ready since i bought the tickets last autumn
4943036 she talks about quebec wherever she goes she is the best ambassador that we have
4943037 my mother listened to her my grandmother shes part of quebecs culture a legend
4943038 i am an unconditional fan of celine since the start
4943039 there have been a lot of emotions since the start of this tour but the image i saw most in my head was this night when i came back to this town
4943040 if i learned one thing over my time with henry bonwiller its that mass politics is an emotional struggle above all a primal battle that is more charismatic and animalistic than either ethical or reason

4943060 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4943061 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4943062 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4943063 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4943064 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4943065 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4943074 each team we face is just one step that we have to climb but we are very focused on what we came here to do
4943075 the diversity of influences of four totally different cultures amp societies finnish russian indian and chinese have led my artworks to be more informative socially and environmentally sensitive to me the purpose of being an artist is to reflect and react what one sees and experiences in life and to deliver those facts which sometimes can be quite striking through my art in order to accomplish that i try to achieve the emotional balance between the inner hidden mind and reality my paintings are adjustments of impurities of life the world that i inherit the reality i analyse its ingredients and define its limits
4943076 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4943078 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
4943079 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4943080 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior

4943082 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4943083 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4943084 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4943085 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4943086 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4943087 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4943088 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4943089 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales

4943092 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer
4943093 despu s de veinti n a os de explotarla trajeron unos pocos indios ac pero onas no vinieron m s que tres mujeres la paula la raquel y la petronila fueron las nicas que vinieron ac hombres no vino ninguno

4943096 all por la cordillera como en todos los caminos hay apellidos muy finos pero con una historia muy fiera cuando a los indios mataban para quitarle la tierra
4943097 los pueblos originarios son los primeros que sufrimos la extranjerizacion
4943098 asumir la interculturalidad como hecho de todos no solo los indigenas qus somo interculturales a la fuerza
4943099 en san martin de los andes la confederacion con el pueblo mapuche puso un lote a disposicion del barrio entero
4943100 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4943101 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4943102 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4943103 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4943104 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4943105 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4943106 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4943107 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4943108 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4943109 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4943110 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4943111 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

4943115 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
4943116 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
4943117 bevor wir vertrieben wurden mussten meine schwestern unser haus noch einmal putzen unser vater dachte dass wir wieder zur ckkommen er lie den schl ssel von au en stecken
4943118 in der kirche lag der schutt 60 zentimeter hoch den haben wir mit schubkarren abtransportiert
4943119 ich wurde hier getauft bin zur erstkommunion gegangen und war messdiener
4943120 nach dem hochamt am sonntag brachte der von den alliierten eingesetzte b rgermeister die nachricht das konnte erstmal keiner verstehen
4943121 wir hatten ein kleines pferd mit dem ich nachts hier r ber bin und quasi unser eigentum gestohlen habe
4943122 einmal haben wir eine ganze nacht in der scheune gesessen da war der tommy am ben mit scharfer munition da haben wir uns verkrochen
4943123 wollseifen war f r mich und f r viele andere erledigt
4943124 wir wollen das dach der ehemaligen schule auf privater basis renovieren
4943125 das haben wir uns auf die fahnen geschrieben das machen wir noch

4943127 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4943128 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4943129 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4943130 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4943131 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4943132 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4943133 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4943134 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4943135 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4943136 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4943137 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4943138 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4943139 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4943140 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4943141 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4943142 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4943143 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4943144 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4943145 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4943146 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4943147 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4943148 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4943149 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4943150 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4943151 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4943152 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4943153 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4943154 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4943155 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4943156 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4943157 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4943158 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4943159 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4943160 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4943161 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4943162 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4943163 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4943164 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4943165 ocean city is marylands only recreational beach resort and we send hundreds of millions of dollars to the state over 100 million every year
4943166 the business people ive talked to while down here have told me they think its a good idea and cant understand why people are opposed to it
4943167 its a reasonable proposal its moderate its limited and its very much state controlled
4943168 would be terrible as long as it stays over there
4943169 in the fall i would think they would bring in lots of bus trips and things like that
4943170 i believe it would help control taxes and provide some revenue in off season months
4943171 its about getting the message to the thousands of visitors that come to ocean city
4943172 this is a vibrant family oriented community and we just feel slots would do nothing but bring negativity here destroy small businesses bring additional crime and the need for additional social services to deal with addiction
4943173 i think it might be ok if they have them
4943174 were not gamblers and we have kids so we would come to the shore regardless of a casino
4943175 people might go for a day but theyre not going to stop coming to the beach i dont think it will hurt ocean city
4943176 i think itll bring a lower class of people playing their last quarters when families see that theyre not going to come out here
4943177 this is exactly like a shore birds game i dont think slots would fit here i kind of like the crowd as it is
4943178 itll bring more money around here and people will have to pay better wages
4943179 fortunately heavy maternal drinking is uncommon in many populations but the fact that it is happening at all tells us we need to do a better job of letting mothers know about the effects that alcohol can have on their babys development

4943190 the models tested here confirmed that the health of individual employees and in particular their mental health is a key contributor to productivity loss
4943191 but these models also attest to how other factors measured by a comprehensive hra like the wellness checkpoint contribute to both impaired performance while at work and time away from work these factors exert their influence on productivity loss that are both independent of health and are considerable in their magnitude above and beyond the contribution of health
4943192 the result in this study is a wealth of information that can be used for shaping and guiding efforts to reduce productivity loss this information can help to build the rationale and consensus for taking action
4943193 health is not the only accessible and measurable candidate for intervention efforts
4943194 the models presented in the joem article provide an important framework for our clients to consider group data for their employee and business groups in developing strategies for managing disability return to work programs identifying risk exposures and making informed program decisions that can impact the health of their employees and their organizations

4943203 con la finalidad de que las empresas sigan trabajando al mismo tiempo mejoramos nuestra infraestructura y tratamos de mantener el nivel de empleo
4943204 en castilla la mancha adem s del sector inmobiliario como tal que nos afecta de la misma manera que en toda espa a se da la circunstancia de que tenemos industrias auxiliares muy importantes relacionadas con la construcci n por ejemplo la madera o la cer mica industrial
4943205 no es una cosa en vez de la otra es una cosa adem s de la otra y precisamente eso lo planteamos como una respuesta a la crisis por lo tanto no es que con la crisis vayamos a desistir de hacerlo sino que forma parte de nuestra respuesta a la misma
4943206 a guy who doesnt even know how to follow a simple rule of writing a proper resume
4943207 it bodes well for him as a pragmatic and wise and experienced statesman
4943208 what hes doing here is hes calling an audible when conditions on the field are changing and thats what you do if you want to win the game here one of the pieces of a solution is allowing exploration on that little 2 000 acre plot of land out of the 20 million acres up there in the coastal plain
4943209 with new technology and directional drilling and other measures that can be taken today to minimize even that footprint we know that this can be done safely and this can be managed well
4943210 and i know up here in alaska most every alaskan believes that anwr should be drilled and no one cares more about alaskas environment our lands our wildlife our fresh air our clean water than alaskans themselves and we know that this can be allowed safely cleanly ethically this type of exploration and development of an american supply of energy
4943211 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself
4943212 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
4943213 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due

4943218 bypassed at border inspectors arent using technology claiming laser visas cause backups at international crossings
4943219 you see it was the only workers i could get
4943220 i felt the pilgrims pride arrests were justified and there should be even more enforcement of illegal workers in the u s along with stiffer penalties and quicker deportation
4943221 i was concerned and somewhat surprised that there were so many agencies and organizations rushing in to try to support the families of these criminals
4943222 maybe these organizations need to be concerned with the law abiding citizens and the families that are trying to work according to the laws of our land and still just barely making ends meet
4943223 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4943224 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4943225 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4943226 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4943227 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4943228 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further
4943229 it will be well into 2009 before the market works off all the excesses accumulated during the housing boom

4943239 the history of atlantic records and of sound of contemporary music would be very different without the impact that jerrys great ears uncanny intuition and true genius had on countless artists and their music atlantic said

4943243 he understood music and musicians in a way few label executives did and was able to inspire them to do their best and most original work atlantic said
4943244 our condolences go out to jerrys family and friends during this sad and difficult time

4943256 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4943257 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4943258 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4943259 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4943260 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4943261 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4943262 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

4943273 the united states is inching closer toward ratifying the united nations convention on the law of the sea treaty lost president bush endorsed this treaty in may and has since urged the senate to vote on ratification initial reports indicated that the senate may have attempted to ratify lost before adjourning for the august recess recent reports indicate that a vote to ratify the treaty could take place within the coming weeks former president ronald reagan originally rejected the ratification of lost in 1982 but recent appeals from the bush administration some members of congress and the have caused the treaty to resurface
4943274 the law of the sea treaty lost entered into force in 1994 and has been ratified by 153 countries for a list of recent lost developments the treaty gives the un complete jurisdiction over the oceans and everything in them including the ocean floor with all its resources along with the power to regulate 70 percent of the worlds surface the international seabed authority could require the united states to share intelligence technology and even military information lost could impose restrictions on intelligence gathering by u s submarines activities that are essential to national defense
4943275 the senate foreign relations committee recently heard arguments on the 1982 law of the sea treaty which president ronald reagan rejected but president bill clinton submitted to the senate in 1994 a vote is likely in the weeks ahead and this democratic controlled senate is the same institution whose leadership sought passage of the disastrous comprehensive immigration overhaul legislation

4943282 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4943283 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4943285 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

4943287 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4943288 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4943289 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4943290 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4943291 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4943292 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4943293 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4943294 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4943295 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

4943298 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4943299 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4943300 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4943301 its evident that the intensity theyve been showing in practice carried into the game
4943302 put it out there and let me go get it he couldnt have thrown it any better
4943303 theres not only a lot of talent but a lot of depth there
4943304 i was pleased with alex especially with all the distractions hes had
4943305 i missed two big opportunities those two are things you cant miss
4943306 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4943307 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4943308 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4943309 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4943310 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4943311 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4943312 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4943313 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4943314 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4943315 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4943316 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4943317 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4943318 rib eye steak with steamed vegetables in chefs special mushroom sauce
4943319 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4943320 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4943321 he was working closely with justin smith both inside and outside
4943322 hes going to be a good quarterback for a long time
4943323 im disappointed i had a lot of family and friends here and i didnt give them a lot to cheer about
4943324 we just didnt get into any rhythm we didnt make any plays i probably held the ball too long and we made a lot of mental errors
4943325 weve been friends since 2005 when we both came out in the draft
4943326 and i just encouraged him and he encouraged me weve been buddies for a while now so its good to see him out there he played well tonight hopefully things work out for him
4943327 i was ready to run before i had the ball
4943328 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4943329 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4943330 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4943331 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4943332 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4943333 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4943334 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4943335 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4943336 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4943337 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4943338 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4943339 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4943340 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4943341 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4943342 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4943343 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4943344 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4943345 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4943346 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4943347 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4943348 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4943349 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4943350 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4943351 when we ask about the theological revolution in the tenth century we come to our central hypothesis david is pictured as a responsible free man and the reason for this is he believed he had been fully trusted by god or at least so his theologians have presented him now this is a remarkable and decisive turn in israels faith it is the affirmation that man is not under the law he is trusted to live as he wills to live and is given great responsibilities which he cannot ignore this theology is an affirmation about god it affirms that he is not simply the giver of torah or doer of spectacular saving deeds in history though he does such deeds now this radical statement is affirmed what god does first and best and most is to trust his men with their moment in history he trusts them sets them free from the need to please by law cult or piety he trusts his men not to bring death but to do what must be done for the sake of his whole community he means to take fully what has been given to him freedom from a religious system based on law a myth grounded in appeasement a morality which is petty and a piety which is self effacing now the issue is quite turned around david is free not without responsibility in this austin powers got it right not without high expectations laid upon him but free from the norms and limits which religion had held including those of the moses tradition
4943352 i think people today have never looked so ugly in the whole history of the entire world
4943353 theres a lack of well paying jobs in the area

4943356 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it

4943360 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
4943361 at first they said no we dont know what youre talking about
4943362 but if we have a choice between bpa free or not why not replace them just in case
4943363 we decided to phase out all bpa feeding products by the end of this year
4943364 we never announced the replacement policy that was something that caught on
4943365 its an easy way to do a fundraiser and a good excuse to have a party
4943366 i put paint on the canvas and then i stand back and look at what ive created
4943367 im inspired by looking at something and feeling something and then i just play
4943368 are always just a really nice way to spend an evening
4943369 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4943370 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4943371 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4943372 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4943373 what were doing is taking the problem thats already out there and putting people who suffer from addiction together in a structured residential community
4943374 we should at least know where they are at the very least
4943375 this has been a problem for a long time local municipalities should have more say in where these places go especially in areas where they are concentrated
4943376 chances are if you have a sober living on your street you probably dont know it
4943377 in most cases they are very low key and they like to keep it that way
4943378 weve failed miserably because everyone is so afraid of the rights and civil liberties of these people
4943379 the fact that they fall under the label disabled everyone is just beside themselves
4943380 but we know that sober living homes are an easy target and they have been for a long time
4943381 its not fair for some parts of the city to be saturated with these sober living homes
4943382 the city has zoning laws that restrict all kinds of things and we should be able to say where they are located
4943383 we often get complaints but it is our understanding that the city cannot regulate anything when it comes to these places
4943384 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes
4943385 because of our size we can move the market along
4943386 whether its coal based diesel that goes into wal mart trucks or jet fuel that goes into our fighters all that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil which is the endgame
4943387 coal producers have been unsuccessful in prior efforts to cultivate such a market climate change worries prompted congress last year to turn back an attempt to mandate the use of coal based synthetic fuels
4943388 the air forces involvement comes at a critical time for the coal industry coals biggest customers electric utilities have scrapped at least four dozen proposed coal fired power plants over rising costs and the uncertainties of climate change
4943389 right now coal to liquids looks to me to be pretty darn low on the reasonable list of alternatives
4943390 the notion that the pentagon has to spend all this money to give itself assured supply is kind of a contrived argument
4943391 the consensus of just about everybody on the panel was it didnt make sense
4943392 taught me more about myself than almost anyone or anything else in my life it stretched my imagination and helped me create long lasting relationships
4943393 we used to take the boat out to catalina the three of us on night crossings why not we were immortal
4943394 then i noticed that all our proposed destinations were on water
4943395 i could see us sitting on a pier watching other people in boats when i said why not take the whaler
4943396 is the american people i know that it may sound corny but we met the most amazing people every step of the way
4943397 we pulled into the muskegon michigan yacht club wearing the brightest california clothes imaginable in a time when the idea hadnt yet caught on elsewhere the dockmaster after telling us to move on and after we told him what we were doing invited us in for dinner and even lodged us this was typical we put ourselves into a unique situation and encountered unique responses
4943398 by the power vested in me as town mayor i hereby give you this check for 10
4943399 everywhere we went it was random acts of kindness and these incredible moments of beauty like when we were floating huck finn like down the mississippi when i looked at the guys and said would you just look where we are

4943415 psychosomatic medicine concerns itself with the psychological approach in general medicine
4943416 except for a few ardent and credulous cults however and a numerically less imposing group of psychologically and scientifically minded physicians it has required for the population at large a second world war and a popular pictorial magazine 3 to acquaint the people with the actuality of psychosomatics
4943417 it always seemed to me odd in the extreme that doctors who when students suffered with frequency of micturition before an examination or when in france had actual experiences of the bowel looseness that occurred before action should persistently refuse to seek a psychological correlative not to say an etiological factor when confronted with a case of functional enuresis or mucous colitis i often wonder that the hard boiled and orthodox clinician does not describe emotional weeping as a new disease calling it paroxysmal lacrimation and suggesting treatment by belladonna astringent local application avoidance of sexual excess tea tobacco and alcohol and a salt free diet with restriction of fluid intake proceeding in the event of failure to early removal of the tear glands of course this sounds ludicrous but a good deal of contemporary medicine and surgery seems to me to be on much the same level

4943441 a godsend for the people of this province who have been waiting for too long to pass judgment on the government
4943442 for a government of responsibility credibility and one which has a sincere concern for problems relating to unemployment the cost of electricity and social injustice
4943443 training boys to be honest leaders to accept discipline to be good competitors and to hold canada together as one nation
4943444 discipline must return to the home the school and in other facets of society to have unity and good citizenship
4943445 with a broad view of canada and a great understanding of what the total country looks like and how the people relate in the different regions
4943446 is to show people motorbikes can be driven and just as much fun can be had without terrorizing people or tearing up the highways
4943447 guest starring on more television shows than any other canadian performer
4943448 has become far too expensive for many drivers to compete
4943449 the sport must be supported by new ideas with prompt results if it is to continue to survive
4943450 he was a builder a man who thought for the long haul
4943451 i found it a bit suspect his reference to the uncertainty of an election we appear in terms of timelines to be edging closer to an election every day
4943452 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
4943453 prove it games piedmont ave in stock nintendo wii system amp game
4943454 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
4943455 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
4943456 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
4943457 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
4943458 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
4943459 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
4943460 weve been under threat all this year and before they want our coaching stocks
4943461 our coaches are the best coaches in the world for a nation of 20 million to achieve the results we achieve is down to the coaches we cant keep these great staff and coaches in australia because we have no funding
4943462 could senator obamas skinniness be a liability his slim physique just might have some americans wondering whether he is truly like them
4943463 sometimes its hard to tell if barrack obama is running for president of the united states or mr universe
4943464 only celebrities like barack obama go to the gym three times a day
4943465 obama now appears vulnerable to the kind of character assassination that helped do in senator john kerry the democratic contender in 2004
4943466 kerry was successfully depicted by republicans as an effete windsurfing brie eating french speaking fop
4943467 berliners are germans and germans are foreigners and since well before john kerry was demonized for knowing how to speak french it has been axiomatic that heartland americans dont like foreigners piping up about our elections
4943468 according to a 2006 survey by national geographic roper nearly half of americans between 18 and 24 do not think it necessary to know the location of other countries in which important news is being made
4943469 more than a third consider it not at all important to know a foreign language
4943470 not lack of knowledge per se but arrogance about that lack of knowledge
4943471 my purpose in establishing the killam trusts is to help in the building of canadas future by encouraging advanced study
4943472 thereby i hope in some measure to increase the scientific and scholastic attainments of canadians to develop and expand the work of canadian universities and to promote sympathetic understanding between canadians and the peoples of other countries
4943473 it is my desire that those selected to receive scholarships shall be likely to contribute to the advancement of learning or to win distinction in a profession
4943474 a killam scholar should not be a one sided person
4943475 no person shall be qualified or disqualified as a killam scholar on account of his or her race or religious opinions
4943476 is to try to stay on top of the emerging developments in the academic world to try to ensure that the scholarship program will always be fresh and responsive to current and future needs
4943477 are a perpetual trust and the aim is to keep the capital value at present some 425 million the same or growing after inflation
4943478 as trustees our task is to oversee the expenditures and investment of the funds and the scholarship selection activities the people primarily responsible do a really first class job on deciding on their investment policies
4943479 i get to have interesting discussions with the senior academic people get a good picture of the tremendous work being done in canada we do a terrific job in canada in our universities but we sell ourselves short canadian research is absolutely first class but nobody knows about it
4943480 more money is needed for research to enable canada to keep up with the leading nations such as the united states and the u k
4943481 canadas aim is to be among the top five nations in the world in per capita spending on research by 2010
4943482 is not at his centre fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
4943483 demeaning portrayals of women dampen the dreams of our daughters
4943484 hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
4943485 a woman who wildly mismanages and bankrupts a quarter of a billion dollar campaign operation and then blames sexism in society will dampen the dreams of our daughters
4943486 there was no evidence to satisfy the jury that the prisoner was guilty of the slaying of hurley and had the defence never called a witness the verdict must necessarily have been the same
4943487 my aim wasnt to beat the chinese or any other nationality
4943488 the continued turmoil in the capital markets and the dramatic change in the credit environment diminished our fourth quarter results substantially
4943489 we took active and prudent steps in the second half of the year to deal with the market disruption and credit deterioration and we believe this allows us to move forward from a position of strength despite the uncertain economic environment
4943490 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
4943491 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
4943492 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
4943493 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
4943494 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
4943495 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
4943496 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
4943497 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
4943498 trupele rusesti si au inceput retragerea si vor fi inlocuite de forte de mentinere a pacii
4943499 nu exista niciun semn ca rusia planifica retragerea trupelor sale din contra rusia a marit numarul punctelor de control si isi fortifica pozitiile
4943500 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
4943501 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
4943502 not only does buying locally ensure the best tasting food
4943503 using meat from free range farms isnt just more humane its much healthier
4943504 fairly deep simulation of what it takes to actually win an american election

4943507 its a right left group blog that reads sorta like obsidian wings if they did whip its between postings
4943508 personally id go there only if i was too lazy to mentally masturbate
4943509 these jackoffs seem to think life is some stupid video game where everybody is or should be armed
4943510 i swear to the mother of baal you cant make up stuff this bad its like the self congratulation and the self contradiction are competing with each other
4943511 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
4943512 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
4943513 pilot mark believes the myth that the plane will be held in place by the belt
4943514 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
4943515 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4943516 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4943517 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4943518 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4943519 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
4943520 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
4943521 we will wait for the official communication from the philippine government regarding that matter i cannot just give you comments based on newspaper reports
4943522 even the two non government organizations mentioned to lead in the peace negotiation i am not familiar with them i have no idea if they exist here in mindanao or in manila
4943523 when you talk to rebels it is understood that you suspend your laws over them or they will not talk to you and let their guns speak
4943524 it is regrettable that still many senators who are supposed to be national leaders are ignorant of these models of conflict resolutions around the globe they showed their biases prejudices and hatred in recent days and ganged up on the milf and the moro people as if they are toughies on the streets
4943525 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the
4943526 ultimately habbush could not offer proof that weapons that didnt exist didnt exist
4943527 a china puniu pessoas que concederam entrevistas a jornalistas ou solicitaram permiss es para protestar o que quebra sua promessa de permitir a liberdade de imprensa e de manifesta es nas zonas de protesto durante os jogos

4943529 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4943530 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4943531 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4943532 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4943533 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
4943534 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
4943535 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4943536 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
4943537 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4943538 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4943539 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4943540 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4943541 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4943542 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
4943543 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4943544 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4943545 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4943546 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4943547 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
4943548 ich habe keine zweifel daran dass alle stimmen unserer landtagsfraktion da sein werden
4943549 das programm f r das frau ypsilanti steht ist ein klassisches sozialdemokratisches programm
4943550 solange er zur agenda 2010 steht ist hopfen und malz verloren
4943551 weve had people come in here and eat a lot of burritos at once but nothing like this
4943552 that boy ate a whole mess of burritos tonight he really did
4943553 he could see what he wanted to do and that he was going to do it no question
4943554 but he pushed past it and did the job thats why hes the best
4943555 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4943556 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4943557 you cant be a whore and a virgin at the same time
4943558 when are you going to be as civilized as we are
4943559 im not using anything as an excuse just inefficient with my pitches ive got to use more of the plate rather than hitting edges
4943560 i didnt want to keep trying im going to be fine i can throw its not like i cant throw anymore
4943561 could be possible but im not sure why i feel good its not like i feel tired or anything i still have my velocity when you get tired you lose your velocity in houston i was throwing 94 mph i dont think im getting tired
4943562 im trying to do the same thing i did in the minor leagues
4943563 she cried at least once a day not because she was sad but because the world was so beautiful and life was so short
4943564 theres a lack of well paying jobs in the area
4943565 when folks have a chance to move on they move on
4943566 sri lanka is one of the toughest places to play cricket as you dont get a lot of runs on slow low wickets you have to always stay positive
4943567 team sports like cricket should not be included in the olympics olympics is a personal game where sportsman tries to excel within himself
4943568 it would be unfair to include cricket in the olympics as the players of other sports especially of individual events wait for the single day to happen and show their talents
4943569 hampers other sports but it is the governments who should take corrective measures to ensure that individual sports also get their due
4943570 we have obtained the best possible help to assist us in the case as asif is adamant he is innocent
4943571 we are having the b sample test for the reconfirmation and we have to be present there inshallah i will be cleared
4943572 we want to support the pcb particularly world cricket needs pakistan cricket to be strong so we need to support them but at the moment only on this point of time with a lot of happening in pakistan we have a lot of concerns
4943573 ultimately its the iccs and the boards decision to make what they want to do well have to wait and see what reports does the task force give back to the icc next week
4943574 another key difference this time is that there will be eight teams on the ground its a lot lot harder to strengthen out security measures with so many teams going to different practice venues ground areas that is principally a concern of ours and we would want to see that demonstrated that is a major difference for sure for us
4943575 although we havent been there as for 12 years we know that cricket is a sport and we shouldnt be subjecting the players to risk we cant go anywhere if the security advice says its not safe and at the moment we are not quite ready to make a decision we would certainly be making a recommendation to our board of directors sometimes next week
4943576 dave richardson and his security advisors talked about the commitments made by the pcb to protect the aussies and other cricketing teams during ct
4943577 late one night jen kirkman drank a bottle and a half of wine and then discussed an historical event
4943578 people think the time to leave is when things become unbearable or is a function of the time youve been there its not
4943579 the longer youre at a place the more you think your success depends on your environment
4943580 see your job as a funding source for what you want to do next
4943581 do whats required and do it as quickly as you can then network with those who can give you the growth you need for the next job or even your own company
4943582 the trouble with waiting waiting to vest waiting to retire waiting to get a promotion waiting till you grow up waiting till im older waiting till the kids are out of the house waiting till i is that it doesnt always pay off
4943583 you are going to college in the midst of a psychedelic renaissance
4943584 you are going to college in the midst of a cultural renaissance
4943585 for me individually i was very much in my head
4943586 the antidote to hitler is the study of the deep psyche
4943587 rick is one of the most motivated students i ever had
4943588 and his lifes goal very clearly is to get psychedelics approved for therapeutic medication
4943589 he has a good feel for dealing with people he was more militant when he was younger
4943590 now he knows how government works and his organizational skills are better and he knows how to make friends with his opponents
4943591 the idea of going to the fda and getting psychedelic drugs approved was never seriously pursued by the drug reform movement
4943592 i cant take the visions he proposes and walk over to a congressional office with them
4943593 rick stands alone with his childrens access positions theres almost no real support for that anywhere
4943594 the hysteria about kids and drugs is what drives the drug war today
4943595 in the 1960s it was all about a cultural rebellion but today its all about fear
4943596 its amazing to me the number of people who smoke marijuana and hide it from their kids because its illegal education is the real key its essential this should be a decision of the parents not the government prohibition denies parents the opportunity to have an honest conversation with their kids about making responsible choices
4943597 decreased fear and anxiety increased openness trust and interpersonal closeness
4943598 these people become very sleepy theyre almost not present and it doesnt completely eliminate the pain
4943599 but the combination of mdma and opiates brings people back to alertness and then opens up their access to their emotions and reduces pain
4943600 but will it present a clinical value that significantly exceeds what we already have out there i dont think mdma is unique or that it will produce a magic bullet
4943601 ten million dollars aint gonna do it hell need hundreds of millions of dollars even if hes allowed to keep going
4943602 i think people are ready for a new conversation about the therapeutic value of psychedelics
4943603 to go from here to there really requires a politically powerful medical professional and the mass media to get on top of it and stay on top of it
4943604 great id love to leave my job and work for myself id rather work hard and be my own boss even if its risky
4943605 i could take the early retirement my company is offering and make a little extra money doing something i enjoy
4943606 if i can get the funding i know i can build a business that will make millions of dollars
4943607 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
4943608 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
4943609 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
4943610 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
4943611 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
4943612 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
4943613 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
4943614 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4943615 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4943616 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4943617 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4943618 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4943619 part of my contract was getting invited to spring training but its not like i earned it
4943620 a lot of guys will judge you by that and not see the real person
4943621 a lot of signing bonuses come because of what you did in college once you get the signing bonus what you did in college doesnt mean anything youve got to prove yourself all over again
4943622 i say let us investigate and punish those perpetrators irrespective of whether they are from pakatan rakyat or barisan nasional
4943623 my point is the mainstreatm media is at fault for presenting a biased case not only that but malicious attack against pkr
4943624 wait which way is left left pointing you or left pointing me

4943660 hemos perdido y hemos perdido muy claramente tenemos que intentar recuperarnos de este partido para el pr ximo contra angola y llegar a los cuartos de final con el equipo con m s moral de que la que hemos tenido
4943661 al principio no hemos sido todo lo agresivos que podemos y coincide un poco con la diferencia de cuando estamos jugando los partidos de preparaci n y cuando estamos jugando los partidos de los juegos ol mpicos a pesar de que llevemos tres victorias y una derrota
4943662 una de las causas es porque la presi n de los juegos ol mpicos influye lo suyo y no hemos jugado con la misma frescura que hemos jugado previamente independientemente de las victorias y las derrotas
4943663 lo primero que hay que hacer para animarse es reconocer la realidad y la realidad es que el equipo americano nos ha arrasado
4943664 es la parte m s importante unido a su porcentaje de triples que no coincide con lo que hab an hecho hasta ahora pero la causa est en que nos hacen una presi n como la que a nosotros nos gustar a hacer en la mayor a de las ocasiones
4943665 derrotados de antemano no pero s con menos frescura que en los partidos de preparaci n que hemos jugado cuando te est n robando tantos balones y metiendo tantas canastas pues te vienes un poco abajo
4943666 es muy dif cil jugar en unos juegos ol mpicos contra equipos como grecia alemania china en su casa es muy dif cil como los estados unidos tambi n es muy dif cil jugar en la selecci n cuando la responsabilidad queda m s repartida y es dif cil asumir estas circunstancias y asumirlas bien
4943667 tenemos que hacer un resumen parcial del campeonato en el que ha habido tres xitos de los que tenemos que estar orgullosos porque significa ser segundos de grupo pero l gicamente no podemos estar muy contentos con el partido de hoy hay que reconocer que los americanos lo han hecho con un potencial tremendo y hay que ver c mo somos capaces de ir mejorando estos detalles para tener mas opciones en los cuartos
4943668 si ellos juegan con la intensidad y el acierto de hoy es muy dif cil que lo pueda hacer cualquiera ganarles pero es posible que no jueguen con la misma intensidad y el mismo acierto

4943739 our annual payroll is 10 million without that money in the county it will be devastating
4943740 our skilled doctors would have to find other jobs in other cities
4943741 three years ago we had a 3 million loss so we made cuts and the next year our loss was 2 million
4943742 last year we broke even but we have used up all of our cash reserves that means we are living week to week on checks that we get from insurance companies and medicaid
4943743 nineteen other hospitals in the state receive tax support we dont
4943744 since it is a countywide tax the money can only be used on county property it will not be used for hospital employees salaries
4943745 if the hospital does close we w ill lose several highly paid residents that means the money they spend in the county will be gone too
4943746 t he less money in t he county then the less money we have to spend on things like roads
4943747 i have been in every store on main street handing out fliers i sent out 400 letters to people that i know asking for them to vote for the increase
4943748 if the hospital closes it will be devastating this is all i know
4943749 my mother has used the er and there have been times she might not have made it to another hospital
4943750 all the patients that would normally use our er will have to go to a rkadelphia hot springs or benton to receive care this is just going to cause their wait times to increase when if they had a local hospital they would not have to wait as long
4943751 volunteering in the gift shop has been a lifesaver for me its something that i look forward to
4943752 i would do it every day if i could if the hospital closed it would break my heart because i want to work its a big partof my life
4943753 it will be hard for me to get to hot springs or little rock i would have to pay someone to drive me on my limited budget
4943754 i hope the younger people in the county realize this will hurt the older residents in the area
4943755 someone needs to speak up my mother and i both use the facilities on a regular basis

4943762 were always going to deal with the food versus fuel issue
4943763 most of that has been misdirected at the corn based ethanol industry but when you really get down to it and look at the facts theyre not using foodgrade corn its been the high price of crude and the weak dollar that has contributed more to the problem of high food prices and with us were making it out of fat were not taking significant amounts of fat away from the food industry were always going to deal with that argument but lets let the facts speak for themselves and move on

4943782 can you provide any documentation or evidence of your claim that two different securities which attempt to track the same index will not cause an investor to run afoul of the wash sale rule
4943783 tax courts have ruled that if you swap the securities of one company for the securities of an unrelated company then the securities are not identical and a tax loss is allowed therefore swapping a vanguard mutual fund for a schwab mutual fund should not create a tax wash lets apply the same precedence to index funds if you sold the vanguard 500 fund at a loss and simultaneously purchased the schwab s amp p 500 index fund for the same amount in my opinion a legitimate tax loss in created
4943784 theres some debate but no direct authority on the question of whether two mutual funds keying off the same index are substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule can you sell one s amp p 500 index fund at a loss and buy a different s amp p 500 fund the same day without having a wash sale because there is no direct authority dealing with this question reasonable minds may disagree its always possible to identify differences between funds managed by different companies such as expense ratios and tax load some people conclude on this basis that funds maintained by two different companies are never substantially identical my feeling is that those differences arent enough to prevent the two funds from being substantially identical the point of the wash sale rule is to determine whether youve changed your position relative to the market if you can lay the price graph for your new investment on top of the price graph for the old one and never see a significant disparity as would be the case for two high quality s amp p 500 funds the investments should be considered substantially identical for purposes of the wash sale rule

4943789 viele konsumenten merken gar nicht dass sie von cyberattacken wie spyware oder phishing betroffen sind
4943790 wir m ssen endlich h rter gegen derartige bedrohungen im internet vorgehen um den konsumenten zu sch tzen und sein vertrauen in den online handel wieder herzustellen
4943791 aufgrund der mittlerweile sehr gro en bandbreite an e commerce angeboten im netz ergeben sich gro e qualitative unterschiede im bereich online handel

4943793 denn die markenhersteller werden so marktanteilsverluste gegen ber billiganbietern und handelsmarken ausgleichen wollen andererseits kann es wie erfolgsbeispiele zeigen durch eine ver nderte preiskommunikation oder neue preismodelle gelingen ohne reale preissenkungen dem trend zu folgen
4943794 im detail muss jedoch beachtet werden dass die verbraucher auch weiterhin qualit tsvergleiche anstellen
4943795 daraus folgt dass die verbraucher zum beispiel bei als mangelhaft wahrgenommener qualit t nicht unbedingt zu discountern wechseln sondern eventuell ganz auf den kauf verzichten oder diesen zeitlich verschieben
4943796 auch die lufthansa zeigt dass erfolg im wettbewerb mit billiganbietern m glich ist verbraucher honorieren es sofort wenn die richtigen tasten auf der marketing klaviatur gegriffen werden und die zielgruppenbezogene preiskommunikation stimmt

4943806 we decided to phase out all bpa feeding products by the end of this year
4943807 we never announced the replacement policy that was something that caught on
4943808 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming

4943900 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4943901 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4943902 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4943903 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4943904 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4943905 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4943906 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4943907 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4943908 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4943909 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4943910 he was getting behind in the count he threw me a couple of balls and then he threw one right down the middle and i crushed it

4943919 we made a decision to pursue this type of clean coal project because it provides long term economic and social benefits for our people for many generations to come
4943920 capturing co2 and injecting it into a well to squeeze more oil out of the ground is
4943921 theres a rift between some tribal leaders who see hope in oil gas and coal and people who think energy companies are taking advantage of people who are eager for money
4943922 the cheyenne people are living on one of the poorest reservations in the country and yet for over 30 years they have refused to stripmine their homeland for promises of riches
4943923 renewable energy could do more financially for the tribes than gaming
4943924 wassermangel ist eines der dr ngenden probleme unserer zeit und nicht nur eine frage des reinen vorhandenseins der ressource sondern auch des zugangs und der nutzung wir brauchen ein weltweites international koordiniertes wassermanagement
4943925 generell gilt wasserverbrauch ist nichts schlechtes sondern ein ganz nat rlicher vorgang wenn jedoch w hrend einer d rre noch wasser abgezweigt und verschwendet wird und dann die fischer stromabw rts ihre lebensgrundlage verlieren ist das nicht in ordnung es kommt also drauf an wann wo und wie viel wasser aus der natur entnommen wird
4943926 die deutschen haben beim direkten pro kopf verbrauch einen sehr guten durchschnittswert z hlt man jedoch das virtuelle wasser hinzu schnellt der fu abdruck eines jeden b rgers dramatisch nach oben
4943927 wir haben die verantwortung bei dem import von produkten auf deren wasserverbrauch bei der herstellung zu achten
4943928 es liegt an den unternehmen bei der herstellung von produkten auf einen nachhaltigen und umweltschonenden wasserverbrauch zu achten
4943929 regierungen sollen mit gutem beispiel vorangehen und einen politikrahmen f r verantwortungsvollen umgang mit wasser setzen
4943930 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4943931 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4943932 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4943933 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4943934 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
4943935 please insert the disk labeled windows xp professional cd rom into drive a
4943936 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4943937 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4943938 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4943939 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4943940 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4943941 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4943942 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4943943 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4943944 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4943945 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4943946 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4943947 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4943948 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4943949 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4943950 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4943951 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4943952 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4943953 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4943954 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4943955 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4943956 who are open to doing something on the production side
4943957 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4943958 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4943959 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4943960 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4943961 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4943962 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4943963 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4943964 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4943965 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4943966 mik n ei viittaa siihen ett ven l iset olisivat vet ytym ss
4943967 i will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you and i will proclaim my name the lord in your presence i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion but
4943968 you cannot see my face for no one may see me and live
4943969 there is a place near me where you may stand on a rock when my glory passes by i will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until i have passed by then i will remove my hand and you will see my back but my face must not be seen
4943970 the truth is there are a million steps and we dont even know what the steps are and worse at any given moment we may not be willing or even able to take them and still worse they are different for you and me and they are always changing i have come to believe the sooner we find this truth beautiful the sooner we will fall in love with the god who keeps shaking things up keeps changing the path keeps rocking the boat to test our faith in him teaching us to not rely on easy answers bullet points magic mantras or genies in lamps but rather in his guidance his existence his mercy and his love

4943973 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4943974 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4943975 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4943976 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4943977 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4943978 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4943979 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4943980 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4943981 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4943982 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4943983 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4943984 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4943985 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4943986 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4943987 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4943988 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4943989 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4943990 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4943991 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4943992 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4943993 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4943994 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4943995 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4943996 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4943997 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4943998 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4943999 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4944000 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4944001 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4944002 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4944007 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4944008 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4944009 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4944010 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4944011 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4944012 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4944013 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4944014 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4944015 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4944016 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4944017 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4944018 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4944019 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4944020 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4944021 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4944022 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4944023 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4944024 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4944025 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4944026 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4944027 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4944028 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4944029 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4944030 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4944031 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4944032 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4944033 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4944034 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4944035 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4944036 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4944037 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4944038 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4944039 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4944040 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4944041 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4944042 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4944043 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4944044 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4944045 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4944050 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4944051 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4944052 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4944053 this is a planning took where all things are going
4944054 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4944055 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4944056 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4944057 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4944058 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4944059 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4944060 our racing giveaway went so well last year we couldnt resist doing it again while making it bigger and better
4944061 we wanted to give our customers the opportunity notonly watch the race from great seats but to also walk freely in the garages and pits and meet some of todays best drivers with this promotion there are four chances to win the racing trip of a lifetime
4944062 my sons and grandson were able to meet several well known drivers and the seats were right where we could see everything
4944063 we are excited to give away these four behind the scenes nascar experiences
4944064 if the dur hams experience is any indica tion we are going to have four really exited customers when oct 10 arrives
4944065 since my first mock draft a couple of weeks ago miami went and signed jake long thereby making me look like the fraud
4944066 i thought no way bill parcells makes an offensive lineman the top pick but i guess you never know
4944067 the front office wants chris long the coach wants glenn dorsey
4944068 a few weeks ago this looked like atlanta might trade out but with dorsey there they will take him
4944069 while it would be strange for mcfadden to fall to number 4 imagine the raiders with jamarcus russell assuming he gets his act together and mcfadden in the backfield
4944070 steve mcnair retired and the defense isnt strong enough anymore win alone everyone remembers how even trent dilfer one of the biggest fantasy frauds ever won a super bowl they need a franchise qb and ryan is it
4944071 the jets may also try to trade up to get ryan as there qb situation is not very good
4944072 the pats dont need much but they will be happy to get a young offensive lineman to protect tom brady for the next 7 years kansas city chiefs trade with baltimore aqib talib cb kansas
4944073 the chiefs need receivers offensive linemen and help at the corners with the dolphins signing jake long they will be happy to move down
4944074 cincinnati needs defensive help especially on the line harvey will bring stability to that spot
4944075 another team that needs defensive help the defense let the saints down in 2007 and to get back to the playoffs they need to beef up the d however one rookie will not make the difference they do need other players changes
4944076 there is just one day left and there are two big questions what will the st louis rams do as this affects everything else and where does matt ryan wind up
4944077 jika provokasi berlanjut besok apakah saya akan melakukan hal yang sama seperti di olimpico turin ya pasti
4944078 tapi ini adalah pertandingan yang penting karena mengusung nama ayah presiden kami dan mengingat fluktuasi dari pertandingan friendly kami sebelumnya kami akan berusaha tampil baik melawan tim yang sedang dalam kondisi bagus
4944079 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4944080 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4944081 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4944082 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4944083 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4944084 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4944085 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4944086 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4944087 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4944088 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4944089 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4944090 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4944091 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4944092 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4944093 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4944094 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4944095 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4944096 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4944097 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4944098 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4944099 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4944100 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4944101 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4944102 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4944103 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4944104 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4944105 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4944106 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4944107 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4944108 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4944109 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4944110 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4944111 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4944112 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4944113 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4944114 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4944115 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4944116 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4944117 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4944118 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4944119 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4944120 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4944121 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4944122 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4944123 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4944124 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4944125 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4944126 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4944127 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4944128 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4944129 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4944130 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4944131 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4944132 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4944133 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4944134 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4944135 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4944136 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4944137 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4944138 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4944139 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4944140 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4944141 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4944142 when you walk around in a public place in a bikini i dont think there is a clear expectation of privacy
4944143 workouts tests interviews pseudo contract negotiations and so on will all have an affect on how the top 10 plays out
4944144 the story last week was bill parcells was going to take ol jake long from not happening
4944145 its hard to believe the rams have the 2nd pick as not long ago the rams were a strong team
4944146 this could be a traded pick while atlanta could use help on the offensive line especially to help michael turner they still need a qb
4944147 if they keep the pick it will be long if they trade they would trade down and probably try to get qb matt ryan further down
4944148 while it would be strange for mcfadden to fall to number 4 imagine the raiders with jamarcus russell assuming he gets his act together and mcfadden in the backfield
4944149 the chiefs need receivers offensive linemen and help at the corners if they dont trade up to get jake long then they will grab talib
4944150 the jets may also try to trade up to get mcfadden as they should realize by now what a fraud thomas jones is at starting rb if they cant trade up then the jets will probably take gholston
4944151 the pats dont need much but they will be happy to get a young offensive lineman to protect tom brady for the next 7 years albert fits the bill
4944152 it seems like the ravens havent had a quarterback since they moved to baltimore as even trent dilfer one of the biggest fantasy frauds ever was a starter
4944153 cincinnati needs defensive help especially on the line harvey will bring stability to that spot
4944154 another team that needs defensive help the defense let the saints down in 2007 and to get back to the playoffs they need to beef up the d however one rookie will not make the difference they do need other players changes
4944155 there still could be some free agent moves that affect the top ten couple that with workouts and bill parcells the first round especially the top 5 is constantly changing teams want to find that next gold mine and are wary of getting stuck with a fraud
4944156 look for many things to change before april 26th and expect many surprises even on draft day
4944157 pitchers are so hard to judge from year to year
4944158 someone who was a disaster last year may turn around and go from fraud to hot pick very quickly
4944159 the bottom line is that this is a work in progress but on the other hand the frustration level among my parents is growing exponentially
4944160 everyones general consensus is its very inconvenient and its not what we wanted
4944161 we pay taxes so we should reap the benefits of public transportation
4944162 the middle school problems have been resolved by a combination of shortening routes and placing buses without middle school routes at middle schools to help the buses that were late
4944163 the overcrowded situations have been addressed by moving kids from crowed buses to buses with room
4944164 i do not anticipate adding any more buses but we will add if a situation arises that warrants an additional bus
4944165 they cant make a penny on it we check on it very closely
4944166 and we make sure they dont go and buy gas from their friends
4944167 until we add to the supply side demand will stay high and so will the price
4944168 from what i could gather its a substantial amount of money thats claimed to have disappeared
4944169 i would think that there may be some evidence of mishandling of monies but we have no concrete idea of who is responsible
4944170 this creates a large negative balance in their account since they are not placed in a job for several weeks
4944171 as a result most of the offenders have negative account balances for several months
4944172 as i mentioned to you after the meeting due to the decrease in our population over the past few months our income has dropped severely
4944173 once our count is back up to 70 inmates and we close down facility no 2 we will be in better shape financially however it will take a few months to reach that point and we are really struggling to pay the bills
4944174 when the joint meeting resumed the lccc board notified the department of its intent to cease operations as soon as the offenders could be safely and properly reassigned to other work release facilities
4944175 for the personal funds wages and or compensation belonging to and held in trust for inmates who were assigned and under the care of the center
4944176 we sing for the survivors who are in this community and throughout this country
4944177 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4944178 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4944179 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4944180 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4944181 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4944182 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4944183 ex gete mucho a ti mismo y espera poco de los dem s as te ahorrar s disgustos
4944184 the first question students ask me is have you ever been shot and the answer is no the second question is have you ever shot anyone and the answer to that is also no
4944185 there was this goose standing in the middle of the bus lane and the buses would honk hed honk i approached the goose and he started hissing and stretching his neck out so i backed off
4944186 i think most students have a negative or stereotypical perception of law enforcement i hope they see me as a real person what has amazed me is the students here have been tremendously forthcoming when it comes to talking with me the teachers and counselors about problems at home or in their neighborhoods
4944187 monday will be busy well have a lot new parents dropping off their children for the first time and ill be keeping the bus lane clear of cars and doing a lot of traffic and pedestrian control
4944188 the last thing i want to do on this campus is be a policeman but students lose their rights when they interfere with the rights of other students to get an education
4944189 school is safe because the students chose to make it safe when they chose not to participate in bad behavior such as verbal or physical violence
4944190 thats harder because there are more people on campus including visitors from other communities everyone at the school works to make sure a friendly rivalry doesnt turn into a conflict
4944191 even the dress code is enforced at our event we tell the visiting schools these are our home rules to be observed
4944192 the most common thing i see with children at this age is verbal conflict i tell them verbal abuse precedes physical abuse and help them understand that if youre depriving someone of their self esteem then you are victimizing that person with your words you can verbally destroy a person to the point where they act out violently
4944193 cyber bullying has been spreading predominately among girls trying to destroy other girls reputations bullying is where it starts it starts as bullying and becomes violence we explain to the students how words can inflict harm and pain
4944194 they called her radar ears theyd tease her at the bus stop and at school so she endured this constant teasing all day i was sitting across the aisle from her on the bus one day and the kids were spitting spit wads into her hair i looked over and her head was down but i could tell she was crying i was ashamed of myself and still am it hurt me because i was a coward i didnt ask an adult to intervene and help her that little girl was brave but i wasnt i dont know what happened to her but i know when we destroy someones self esteem they tend not to go far in life
4944195 i just love these kids as if they were my own i feel like im making a positive impact in their lives and each and every adult at this school has genuine care and concern for our students
4944196 i believe we have to give something back to our communities my uncle was a policeman and that had a lot to do with wanting to be one when i grew up
4944197 i had never played before my eighth grade year and dad got me ready for it
4944198 ty getting involved spiked my appetite to try it again
4944199 i watch her play nine months a year and she watches me play two weeks its a fair trade off
4944200 it is the premier womens sport because it doesnt suffer by comparison like basketball or softball
4944201 ill be happy to go as far as i can go
4944202 when i got my first piece of rhinestone jewelry i thought i had died and gone to heaven so of course i coveted everything after that
4944203 in order to sell a particular house the buyers wanted all the antique furniture that was inside so to make the sell i sold them the furniture for about 1 500
4944204 later i found out that one bed was worth 1 500 thats when i knew i needed to get into that business
4944205 there are no schools you can go to for this once you think you know everything there is to know you learn more
4944206 now i am a quintessential expert on jewelry people usually think of jewelry as just diamonds but its so much more
4944207 carol told another designer doug hall about me and one thing led to another and i was asked to work on billy bob thorntons movie all the pretty horses
4944208 to get into these books you have to be sponsored now when anyone in the industry looks in these books under v intage clothes or jewelr y they will see my name
4944209 they can contact me from anywhere in the united states
4944210 once youre in the loop and they know you have a place with all this stuff then they start to talk my pieces have been used in road to perdition mona lisa smile the last samurai a walk to remember divine secrets of the ya ya sisterhood and domestic disturbance
4944211 now i am working on my one and only with renee zellweger kevin bacon and chris noth i am providing all the jewelry for the film with the exception of a few pieces and several hundred other pieces
4944212 its a wonderful privilege to work on this film i love to watch a scene develop with just a piece of jewelry a hat or a good pair of shoes
4944213 as part of the screening committee we screen all the entries for the documentary film festival last year there were 1 200 entries
4944214 i love the institute and i want to see them succeed
4944215 you have to like what you are doing otherwise you are going to be a miserable human being just working for a dollar
4944216 sometimes you just have an affinity for things i have found my niche and im staying here
4944217 the future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams

4944229 as a claypot member i would like to know why you would like to fellowship with us
4944230 now first of all in this sentence the word prosperity has to be deconstructed it is not prosperity in the sense of a second and third car an extra vacation house or other aspects that we in the suburbs would define as prosperous for this person it means the basics needed to survive and for him we had the keys towards this and we could teach him to also open the future with these keys its hard for me to verbalize why i feel uneasy being placed in this position what i do know is that jesus gave his original disciples the keys to the kingdom not the keys to prosperity this whole incident reminds me of kierkegaards quip that gold and silver i do not have but i give you what i have stand up and walk
4944231 ich habe heute gesehen dass man in dem alter einen olympischen marathon gewinnen kann deshalb ist london 2012 f r mich noch ein thema auch wenn man nie wei was passiert

4944250 in many ways jeremy jay appears to be a man out of time
4944251 hes a beautiful rebel from a peter pan storybook creating a garage punk tinged soundtrack to an old movie and when he croons on
4944252 part poet part 50s teen idol and part ghost jeremy jay begins his debut album by wishing his listeners goodnight then pulls them into his lovely haunting world
4944253 intelligent concise melodic distinctive amp ravishing if i was forced into summing up jeremy jays debut lp with five words these are the few i would select the 11 track 29 minute album is one of the most glorious records ive heard thus far this year part vintage singer songwriter part modern day wordsmith amp part futuristic narrator js simplistic style transcends genres amp confines alike a place where we could go is not only a much needed breath of fresh air it represents a tidal wave of ingenuity
4944254 nice food however we are disappointed that they changed from a non smoking establishment to a smoking establishment this was a backward move in
4944255 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4944256 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4944257 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4944258 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
4944259 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground

4944272 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
4944273 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it

4944284 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4944285 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

4944287 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
4944288 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
4944289 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
4944290 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4944291 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
4944292 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
4944293 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4944294 in the summer of 2007 as arctic sea ice reached a record low the northwest passage opened between baffin bay and mcclure strait also known as mclure strait passing through parry channel this opening would be the route through the arctic most conducive to large scale shipping as of early august 2008 arctic sea ice was not expected to set a new melt record although its extent was well below the long term average whether the northwest passage would open as far north as it did the previous year remained in question but the sea ice in a more southerly route one taken by norwegian explorer roald amundsen in the early twentieth century had begun to melt

4944325 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4944326 what we think is we need to have a real debate about the issue and that includes a real look at the costs of some of the policies being promoted
4944327 lets look at taking whatever revenue is derived from that and devote it entirely to tax relief
4944328 we think that there are solutions to whatever the climate crisis may be that are market based that dont involve increasing the size of government substantially
4944329 do we want to create a model where the solutions for dependence on oil come out of europe or asia and were sitting here in the u s because we want to argue for the status quo
4944330 the scientific data show the change is accelerating so when you do take measures the longer you delay the more aggressive those measures have to be
4944331 its important to address those issues sooner rather than later
4944332 if the united states congress would have the backbone enough to announce to this world that we are going to deregulate and we are going to begin to drill and refine american oil we would begin to see gas prices plummet
4944333 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment

4944346 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4944347 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4944348 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4944349 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4944350 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4944351 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4944352 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4944353 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4944354 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4944355 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4944356 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both

4944368 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
4944369 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4944370 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4944371 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4944372 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4944373 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore

4944376 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse

4944386 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4944387 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4944388 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4944389 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4944390 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4944391 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4944392 he did a chart how many plays we were out there

4944402 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4944403 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4944404 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4944405 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4944406 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4944407 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4944408 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4944409 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4944410 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4944411 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4944412 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4944413 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4944414 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4944415 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4944416 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4944417 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4944418 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4944419 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4944420 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4944421 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4944422 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4944423 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4944424 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4944425 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4944426 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4944427 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4944428 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4944429 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4944430 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4944431 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4944432 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4944433 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4944434 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4944435 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4944436 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4944437 just so you all know we did set a record
4944438 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4944439 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4944440 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4944441 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4944442 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula

4944445 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4944446 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source
4944447 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4944448 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4944449 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4944450 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4944451 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4944452 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4944453 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4944454 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4944455 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
4944456 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
4944457 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
4944458 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
4944459 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
4944460 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
4944461 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
4944462 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change

4944464 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
4944465 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
4944466 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
4944467 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
4944468 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
4944469 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
4944470 i was able to theoretically confirm that planned design changes to the current bifilar fault current limiter being developed by siemens and american superconductor would decrease ac losses in the system my calculations are good news for the future of the device
4944471 i modelled the bifilar design as an infinite stack of superconducting tapes in which adjacent tapes carry current in opposite directions i was able to find an exact solution for the magnetic fields and currents that are generated in such a stack of tapes once i calculated how the magnetic flux penetrates into the tape i then could calculate how much energy is lost in each current cycle for different tape widths and spacings between adjacent tapes
4944472 they dont see as much difference between themselves and others
4944473 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
4944474 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
4944475 i hereby declare quasar the official tangency news herald first class of the most exalted of geeks who want to know so let it be written so let it be done

4944479 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4944480 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4944481 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4944482 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4944483 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4944484 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4944485 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4944486 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4944487 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4944488 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4944489 they returned to camp late the next morning after a lie in and half a cup of tea each
4944490 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4944491 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4944492 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4944493 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4944494 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4944495 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4944496 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4944497 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4944498 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4944499 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4944500 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4944501 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4944502 mwah niet echt alleen 8 huizen afgebrand 1 straat verder en jij

4944507 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4944508 i dont have good finishes at those racetracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season

4944510 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4944511 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4944512 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4944513 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save

4944521 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4944522 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4944523 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4944524 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play

4944743 also i am assuming we would have to play career rounds on our own again as have heard no mention of this at all in the press and surely this would get some coverage or am i thinking purely as a hard core fan again
4944744 i have a horrible feeling that it is going to be just as easy to play as 08 is
4944745 how has the tour pro difficulty level been since the first xbox 360 game easier harder
4944746 it kept me on schedule i didnt have a lot of time for nonsense
4944747 its not about xs and os its about the impact you have on young mens lives
4944748 you dont just teach them the game of football you teach them the game of life
4944749 theres a whole regiment to get kids to that point
4944750 i have to teach grade papers and prepare lesson plans too
4944751 seeing young men go off to college or to the military or becoming a productive member of society and knowing i had a part in it is very special to me
4944752 its my responsibility to instill values that my coachesinstilled in me
4944753 the program stated because we were sick and tired of watching our teachers pull money out of their own pockets to buy art supplies when they dont make that much money in the first place
4944754 anda lot of arkansas families are poor so they shouldnt have to pay for it either
4944755 and with art supplies youre not talking about reusable resources they run out every year so ultimately it should be a budget thing not some nonprofit trying to help but until then well try to help because its a chronic problem
4944756 education is one of the things we mean when we talk about investing in the area
4944757 paul has a reallycontagious spirit about him and we really believe in this project
4944758 this is what i exist for im so proud of all of these kids and i could put 50 more pictures up there
4944759 if anybodys story can teach you something about the power of education its my story
4944760 education is like this little door it doesnt seem like much but then it opens up to make everything else possible
4944761 getting that letter was the worst day of my life
4944762 but after it was over in all my time to reflect afterward i know that in truth i still want to be in education its been hard to realize that my ambition if you can call it that isnt more than that i really want to teach more than i want to be an astronaut and its been hard to come to terms with that where im at im at my best and thats in the classroom
4944763 i have decided that since i cant go into space one of my kids has to
4944764 and the first one to do it has to invite me to the launch
4944765 every time i stand in front of a new class i remember your kindness and that is what i want to give that kind gentle push toward unimaginable opportunity
4944766 in a million years i would have never foreseen the places i would go or the events and things i would experience that is the power of education
4944767 its part of your job to do what dianne tiner did for me
4944768 i ought to be getting old and slowing down but im just as excited as the day i started
4944769 education should be such that what is offered is perceived as a valuable gift and not a hard duty
4944770 i dont know what to feel right now its so emotional all i want to do is go see my mom
4944771 i wanted to win a gold but i gave it my best shot and im thinking maybe i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
4944772 i know its too late to add this take this out
4944773 then 9 11 happened and i couldnt take it anymore
4944774 the response to 9 11 the right was saying this is pure evil were facing and the left was saying how are we at fault for this
4944775 they pay good money big money i wouldnt help them for nothing
4944776 money is one thing i have to make a living but jess is my swimmer ive brought her through since she was a 12 year old and lucy has beaten her

4944782 airports and airlines worldwide are feeling the effects of surging fuel prices and economic uncertainties conditions we expect will likely continue
4944783 airlines have started to reduce flight frequencies to contain losses as a result we anticipate a more difficult operating environment and slower growth for all categories of air traffic for the remainder of the year
4944784 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4944785 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4944786 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4944787 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4944788 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4944789 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4944790 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4944791 wtf where have you been my bladder is full and no one else knows doggie speak but you
4944792 but i do not want to have to waste time sitting in front of my pc

4944814 the point was for the skrulls to relay their messages via the most recognizable and influential people in different parts of the world
4944815 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4944816 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4944817 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4944818 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4944819 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4944820 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4944821 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4944822 it is difficult to maintain momentum if it is you that you are following
4944823 i dont read media matters if asked would i rather read media matters debbie schlussel or jump off a tall building im gonna ask you well how talls the building because it is the best choice of the three
4944824 this group of radical leftists paid by george soros with a mission to discredit conservatives this isnt the kind of group i think we should feel compelled to be answering all the time our side seems to think well i dont want to be criticized we dont wanna look bad the more media matters criticizes me the better i like it and the less i intend to read it we can talk about media matters about as long as i can tolerate it and im already close to my limit
4944825 who cares i dont care my comment on media matters is who cares
4944826 i think that media matters wouldnt know a serious flaw if it bit em in the behind i cant stand media matters i dont think media matters does anything of worth if you think theres a serious flaw what is it when you mention media matters i am thinking that i am wasting my time listening for the next two minutes if you want to talk to me about media matters im out
4944827 barack obamas people dont want people reading whats in this book
4944828 im not a part of the washington establishment name dropping washington cocktail party establishment and im never gonna be a part of that because that is not who i am
4944829 appearing on a show is not an endorsement of the host i do a 120 shows and do most of the shows that come to me if i had to agree with every talk show host id never go on any shows being on a show does not mean i endorse a hosts views i have even been on liberal shows and i sure dont endorse them
4944830 thatll make you a nut to those guys you better be careful about agreeing with me about anything
4944831 it certainly looks more than suspicious and now obama is trying to explain how all of this relates and what is the relationship i dont know if i was working with anybody first of all i cant imagine that i would ever want to be associated with someone like rezko let alone taking campaign contributions from him or um letting him be involved in buying a property with me im asking what i am saying is i am not definitively concluding anything im just saying that these questions arent being sufficiently asked in the chicago newspapers research they are reporting them im asking the same questions the chicago papers are asking which obama has not truly answered to answer them fully you might need the authority of a prosecutor you might need the authority of a criminal investigator you might even need the authority of a grand jury
4944832 im an investigative reporter saying okay heres the issue and im raising a question about these issues now im not a prosecutor i dont have subpoena power i dont have grand jury power i cant tell testimony but you know if i were in those positions i might well consider doing so but im not im an investigative reporter i just raise questions and i dont say anywhere in the book i dont say anything definitive about it more than this looks suspicious there are some things that are pretty definitive you know im positive that the frank in dreams of my father is frank marshall davis but even in his rebuttal it confirms that i dont think there is any question that frank is frank marshall davis weve established that now whether the loan was involved in the purchase of the obama dream property i cant say for sure one way or the other i just ask questions
4944833 why did it take obama so long to conclude that rezko was a shady character
4944834 it is definitely important to target the youngsters early rugby is a simple game and i think sometimes we overcomplicate it even at the highest level players make mistake so its important to get the basics right
4944835 if you break down the all blacks game it is a basic game but it is done very well at speed and this is what we are trying to teach if you do the basics well and at speed you are going to be a hard team to beat
4944836 i think our skills and drills are different the drills are shorter and sharper sometimes the coaching sessions over here are too long
4944837 it has been really good and has definitely improved our overall game learning the haka has been fantastic we hope we will be able to use it in our matches next season
4944838 the thing that has struck me most of all is the intensity of the training drills of course they are bringing new skills and ideas but the regime means the boys are physically and mentally tired by the end of the day
4944839 on ne sexplique pas ce r sultat a r agi hardy on est tr s d us on n tait pas venus pour a
4944840 on savait que c tait peut tre la course de notre vie pour nous et pour les gens quon aime
4944841 abbiamo tanti motivi per essere felici prima di tutto siamo vivi
4944842 s ti amo ma non so se posso fidarmi di te
4944843 well we knew this was going to happen sooner rather than later
4944844 were pretty well on track with where we were in athens i think we had three after seven or eight days in athens
4944845 pretty emotional for us the gold medal ceremony at the wrestling
4944846 i dont know who cried more me or the athlete but it really was an exciting day for us
4944847 i think that weve known all along that the second half of the games is where we start to pick up
4944848 you know that its hard to understand but in the village we dont really get these messages because we dont have the television we dont have the papers the athletes dont have time to go on the internet that much
4944849 we have a couple long ballers in glenn and i while rob and mike are not that long but are accurate with a good wedge game and great putters we are a good combination
4944850 but more importantly we dont have any partiers so we wont be worn out from drinking and partying thatll definitely help us
4944851 i have knocked on the door a few times but always came up short
4944852 i had a renewed focus i dedicated myself off the course more and i have a clearer head
4944853 it didnt all show up right away it took awhile i have been on the straight and narrow for the past two years the spinoffs are starting to come through
4944854 i dont know about that because two of the three holes are par 5s
4944855 they must be really really tight and tricky around the greens its not a lengthy course which could be to our advantage
4944856 and we all have a fair amount of experience at the national level so im not concerned about the nerves
4944857 were amateur players were not making a living out of this if you play a bad shot or play a bad round its only golf
4944858 but well be giving it our all to bring home a championship for our province
4944859 traditionally canada does better in the second week just due to the fact that the events that we tend to do are in the second week for whatever reason
4944860 its just a coincidence so were looking forward to some really good results next week
4944861 living outside the village has been good very quiet christopher is in a good mindset
4944862 im making a lot more putts than i did the first day
4944863 all i can do is play the best i can and try to shoot a low score ill focus on being consistent hitting fairways and greens
4944864 i didnt come here to run the world record because i was the world record holder
4944865 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 metres
4944866 that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4944867 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4944868 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4944869 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its probably going to set in
4944870 im healthy my leg is a little sore just from the rounds
4944871 there are a number of states that have talked about an early release of prisoners deemed non threatening the problem just keeps getting bigger and bigger youre paying a lot of money here you have to ask if some of these high mandatory sentences make sense
4944872 the united states has less than 5 percent of the worlds population but it has almost a quarter of the worlds prisoners indeed the united states leads the world in producing prisoners a reflection of a relatively recent and now entirely distinctive american approach to crime and punishment americans are locked up for crimes from writing bad checks to using drugs that would rarely produce prison sentences in other countries and in particular they are kept incarcerated far longer than prisoners in other nations criminologists and legal scholars in other industrialized nations say they are mystified and appalled by the number and length of american prison sentences
4944873 unfortunately a lot of the answer is democracy just what tocqueville was talking about
4944874 we will not release criminals early for fiscal reasons we will work with you to build new prisons to house criminals we will keep our commitment to protect the people of colorado
4944875 a cost benefit analysis of prison cell construction and alternative sanctions
4944876 the benefit cost results imply that the concentration on increasing sentence length in recent years is not particularly good public policy
4944877 shockingly owens used him to support a policy he would never approve sanction
4944878 82 percent of offenders who were sentenced to some type of confinement were re arrested within 20 years according to a 1999 national institute of justice study
4944879 offer little support for the policy trends prominent since this project began that have supported increased use of confinement as a sentencing choice emphasized longer terms or accepted specific deterrence to reduce offenders recidivism
4944880 one of the central and indispensable functions of government is to provide for public safety one of the surest ways to achieve that is through incarceration
4944881 when used improperly benefit cost analyses can become nothing but rhetorical ammunition in an ideological debate
4944882 63 percent of felons were charged with a felony within three years of release
4944883 we know that releasing prisoners will result in new crimes committed crimes that would not have occurred if a criminal remained behind bars
4944884 override our primary duty to protect the safety of coloradans
4944885 the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed and hence clamorous to be lead safely by menacing it with endless series of hobgoblins all of them imaginary
4944886 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4944887 it is more than misleading its based on assumptions that could cost you
4944888 jika anda datang ke sana ajang pameran game untuk itu cari diskon maka siap siap saja kecewa

4944890 it is an important game because i hope to get the answers from the players that i hope to achieve
4944891 i have to check on the form before the qualifiers but experimenting is finished
4944892 when i started working with the players they were a bit scared and afraid after a lot of players played better
4944893 its not fear about me but it was soon after not qualifying and for the players it was like an examination or test it is not so
4944894 i think they know me what i ask of them about my style the movement around the pitch they know and its better now
4944895 the first and second games were different teams and it was hard enough i think they know better because at the end of the season we had 10 days together
4944896 when playing with their clubs there is no losing mentality i think if you can train with them every day it is easy to change the mentality with every moment of training with the different work
4944897 i try to transfer the mentality into the national team because you have to play the same spirit that you see in the clubs
4944898 i saw the games for the european qualifiers the matches at the start of the season like against russia and they played very well and with spirit
4944899 you have to play with that spirit and that mentality i think it is impossible to lose that just because we did not qualify for the european championships
4944900 in the last four friendlies we have played i have seen one step forward every time towards recovering the mentality
4944901 i think three months ago people never spoke about spain now they are the best team in the world its a miracle
4944902 spain is a very good team they played well but we are different and i think you can win against spain why not im very confident in my team
4944903 i think rooney can be both its possible to play like a second forward and score goals
4944904 he played very well in two games he didnt score but i was very happy with the performance
4944905 you have to play in a different style the other players they have to score more goals
4944906 you have to come in front of the goal with a lot of players
4944907 its a problem everywhere italy so so in attack germany so so only torres is a big striker in this moment in the world
4944908 portugal no also the french you didnt see anything at euro 2008 its a big problem now because the teams defend very well
4944909 wir sind keine ehefrauen sondern frauen der nacht wir schaffen eine geheime symbaloo
4944910 i want to live like a superstar to me the biggest superstar in the world is m nasir
4944911 with carl crawford and evan longoria going down simultaneously i thought id make one last vain attempt to reach out to tampa bay and to no avail
4944912 thats because major league baseball has been successful in their pursuit in blackballing barry out of the game
4944913 id like to have one more chance without a doubt
4944914 it really would have to be the right place and the team that did it would have to believe i wouldnt walk away
4944915 then i said make it a dollar and a nickel so sharon can get her cut

4944920 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
4944921 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
4944922 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
4944923 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
4944924 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
4944925 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
4944926 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in order to get something else through
4944927 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit
4944928 i got behind 0 2 in a period of 15 seconds and i was like oh no not this again
4944929 i dont care who ended it we needed to win this game
4944930 it would have been a rough one for us to lose
4944931 thank you for your input you are an incredible asset to our team
4944932 i got home and immediately knew it wasnt gluten free
4944933 my friend barely made it out of the parking lot
4944934 people by now have heard about celiac but theres still misconceptions no we cant have a little bit of wheat and yes it matters whats in our medications because youll find it there too
4944935 the great news is when you take away the gluten the ill effects of the disease goes away
4944936 its the one autoimmune condition in which you can do that get well stay well i ran my first half marathon in may
4944937 people dont realize beer has gluten in it but there are gluten free alternatives for everything including beer now thats relatively new
4944938 my a ha moment came when i read that diarrhea doesnt have to be a symptom for adults and that was my case
4944939 once i knew what i had and took care of it ive felt great since
4944940 when lucille comes in the door she knows exactly who she is going to visit
4944941 for the first few years i kept fairly busy but i didnt have a purpose you know and one day i was visiting my daughters mother in law and she had a senior companion and i thought id like to do that and so i inquired into it and ive been here ever since
4944942 they seem to enjoy talking about our childhood we went through the depression weve done all those things together so we have a really good time i have really good friends here
4944943 most of them enjoy getting out and being part of the community and just giving back theyve worked most of their lives and they dont find that retirement is the thing that they quite want to do yet so i think its rewarding and the people who are their clients they get to be companions sometimes lifelong
4944944 you need a game plan and make sure you are organized
4944945 we are hoping to have matt barr to play hardy brown
4944946 we are very excited to welcome one of borders new concept stores to watters creek
4944947 borders is already a great store for books and entertainment but i think customers are really going to be impressed with what they find at this location this store adds another unique and important element to the mix at watters creek
4944948 large net fractions of domestic institutions reported having tightened their lending standards and terms on all major loan categories over the previous three months in particular the net fractions of banks that had tightened credit standards on consumer loans increased notably relative to the april survey
4944949 indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on commercial and industrial loans to small firms over the same period

4945005 the thursday friday and saturday nights of welcome week are without question the busiest nights of the year for the east lansing police department
4945006 it would take 7 000 freshmen out of the equation which would be extremely helpful
4945007 all they do is drink 24 7 and in that condition they walk in front of our house all the time taking stuff from our front porch ripping flags off our house theyve picked up our planter on our porch and thrown it at the streetlight across the street

4945009 roving bands of lower classmen who have come from campus
4945010 its just kind of a free for all and they are wise to shorten it because theres really nothing productive that gets done during that time anyhow
4945011 a whole bunch of college students binge drinking all day every day
4945012 it also gives freshmen a chance to see that this is a school theyre going to like
4945013 they can meet people and these are people theyre going to be friends with for the rest of the year
4945014 but i do have evidence of the negative consequences of having a longer time
4945015 and i dont have any evidence yet of the positive or negative of shortening it
4945016 its cool the little kids have enough courage to go up there

4945033 we have to really put some quick action into place here because the centre just cant close
4945034 we are positive that we will survive because that is the spirit of this community but we definitely need some help this time
4945035 putting money in would do them no good because just keeping the facility open doesnt help the community if there are no doctors to see patients we need to get them doctors that is the priority
4945036 we dont have a firm contingency plan in place at this time but we have been receiving some calls of interest from physicians so we are keeping positive
4945037 it is crucial for this centre to stay open so we will continue to do everything we can especially since the community has given their heart and soul to this centre

4945054 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a cliche is genius

4945056 sitting on top of his kennel snoopy trying to write his novel only ever gets as far as it was a dark and stormy night
4945057 im ready to concede the guy did have some powers of invention some people credit him with creating the historical novel as we know it
4945058 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius

4945089 this group of radical leftists paid by george soros with a mission to discredit conservatives this isnt the kind of group i think we should feel compelled to be answering all the time our side seems to think well i dont want to be criticized we dont wanna look bad the more media matters criticizes me the better i like it and the less i intend to read it we can talk about media matters about as long as i can tolerate it and im already close to my limit
4945090 who cares i dont care my comment on media matters is who cares
4945091 i think that media matters wouldnt know a serious flaw if it bit em in the behind i cant stand media matters i dont think media matters does anything of worth if you think theres a serious flaw what is it when you mention media matters i am thinking that i am wasting my time listening for the next two minutes if you want to talk to me about media matters im out

4945093 im not a part of the washington establishment name dropping washington cocktail party establishment and im never gonna be a part of that because that is not who i am
4945094 appearing on a show is not an endorsement of the host i do a 120 shows and do most of the shows that come to me if i had to agree with every talk show host id never go on any shows being on a show does not mean i endorse a hosts views i have even been on liberal shows and i sure dont endorse them
4945095 thatll make you a nut to those guys you better be careful about agreeing with me about anything
4945096 it certainly looks more than suspicious and now obama is trying to explain how all of this relates and what is the relationship i dont know if i was working with anybody first of all i cant imagine that i would ever want to be associated with someone like rezko let alone taking campaign contributions from him or um letting him be involved in buying a property with me im asking what i am saying is i am not definitively concluding anything im just saying that these questions arent being sufficiently asked in the chicago newspapers research they are reporting them im asking the same questions the chicago papers are asking which obama has not truly answered to answer them fully you might need the authority of a prosecutor you might need the authority of a criminal investigator you might even need the authority of a grand jury
4945097 im an investigative reporter saying okay heres the issue and im raising a question about these issues now im not a prosecutor i dont have subpoena power i dont have grand jury power i cant tell testimony but you know if i were in those positions i might well consider doing so but im not im an investigative reporter i just raise questions and i dont say anywhere in the book i dont say anything definitive about it more than this looks suspicious there are some things that are pretty definitive you know im positive that the frank in dreams of my father is frank marshall davis but even in his rebuttal it confirms that i dont think there is any question that frank is frank marshall davis weve established that now whether the loan was involved in the purchase of the obama dream property i cant say for sure one way or the other i just ask questions
4945098 why did it take obama so long to conclude that rezko was a shady character

4945111 our fathers had much to say about stillness and by stillness they meant the absence the motion or the absence of noise or both they felt they must be still for at least a part of the day or that day would be wasted god can be known in the tumult of the world if his providence has for the time placed us there but he is known best in the silence so they held and so the sacred scriptures declare inward assurance comes out of the stillness we must be still to know

4945120 the broader concern now is with economic growth especially with signs that even china is slowing down
4945121 it was no surprise that investors tended to pocket their gains whenever the market staged a rebound
4945122 investors lack confidence and rush to take profits whenever there is a rebound
4945123 the market is spiraling downwards nothing is better than keeping cash
4945124 the banks are weighing on the market especially bumi commerce following its 2q results
4945125 there were worries that oil prices will continue to fall which could also drive down prices of commodities
4945126 kiwi equities in the last two or three weeks have actually performed pretty well
4945127 its true that were expanding our production of flat screen models
4945128 we went to chens residence and his office to probe the case the former president and his wife explained the fund transfers
4945129 the couple told us that the money in the overseas bank accounts had nothing to do with any scandals and that the money was intended for use as public funds
4945130 with the fall in oil and other commodity prices in the past month both the markets and fed officials had started to turn away from inflation risks and focus on growth risks
4945131 the view which we agree with is that with the usual long and variable lags falling commodity prices and rising unemployment will drive down inflation no need for the fed to get its hands dirty when the housing and credit crunch will do the job
4945132 the markets are in such a forgiving mood that both the stock and bond markets rallied on thursday despite what can only be described as an ugly cpi report

4945142 people spend so much time in digital worlds that it creates an appetite for the physical world
4945143 you need your hands to verify experimentally a technology that doesnt exist
4945144 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4945145 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4945146 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4945147 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4945148 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works
4945149 in the 1980s one third of the s amp ls were insolvent even if you listen to the extreme reports today it does not sound as if it will be anything like that
4945150 we are trying to cross train them to existing staff to work on bank failures so we dont need a huge staff waiting around for the next bank failure

4945159 it is wonderful here we dont have to put up with the prying eyes of men but on the mixed beaches it is unbearable
4945160 at the end of the day we belong to a conservative society we cannot forget that
4945161 we need to respond to the needs of the community
4945162 just as taiwan would like to have cultural economic and trade relations with chinas allies i am pleased to see our allies develop relations with china if they want to
4945163 as taiwan has better relationships with china the us taiwan relationship will become better and allies of both taiwan and china will benefit from that

4945166 i am just delighted to be back i just want to be back doing what i do and thats living the life of a bullfighter
4945167 so i thought id better go and get a checkup just to make sure
4945168 it is quite a selfish thing to do really i suppose to engage in this sort of activity out of caprice
4945169 i am sort of living the life i want to lead and to some extent i am sure that puts pressure on those who are near me and i am sorry that they have to put up with it but thats it
4945170 theres no way you should be able to eat what michael phelps eats this is not even a normal athlete i would not recommend this kind of diet for even a fit and serious competitor in say a 10km road race this man is in a very very different place to the rest of us hes 1 87m and 87kg of pure joy from a female perspective obviously though i probably shouldnt say that
4945171 after a 4 500 short course yards moderate morning practice
4945172 warm up 800 mixer on 10 30 4x150 kick on 2 30 50 stroke 50 free 50 stroke 400 pull with buoy on 5 00 breathe 3 5 7 9 by 100 200 stroke on 3 00 10x50 on 45 2 25kick 25drill 2 25free 25stroke 1 stroke main set 4x50 on 1 30 1x50 1 20 1x50 1 10 1x50 1 00 1x50 0 50 1x50 0 40 1x50 0 30 long swim down 100 200 300 pull lungbusters by quarters 400 choice kick 300 200 100 im drills
4945173 say hes doing about 6km to 7km a session and a couple of sessions a day
4945174 plus his land training id say hes burning maybe 5 000 calories in training and maybe 2 500 simply to sustain himself something like 8 000 a day in all mind you he is a very big bloke i havent looked at his schedules but 12 000 seems a lot
4945175 ive worked with extreme athletes triathletes for example who work phenomenally hard who expend between 6 000 and 10 000 calories a day
4945176 i can believe someone like phelps is getting through 12 000 and the point is its plainly working for him isnt it nobody could say hes not performing well hes quite clearly expending what hes consuming and just like all of us thats what counts
4945177 it does look quite salty quite fatty not very high in good fiber or in fruit and veg hes certainly not getting his five a day
4945178 i would certainly have expected him to be eating a bit less fat and its all saturated fat the wrong kind i suppose the point with an athlete like phelps though is that he needs a very high calorie intake but a very low volume whereas with the rest of us its the precise reverse we need a low calorie intake and high volume
4945179 and hes going to be burning them at a truly phenomenal rate theres protein in there too obviously which he needs to maintain and repair muscle mass and tissue but for someone like him in a sport like his its really a question of how many carbohydrates he can get in as quickly as possible so this diet might look very high in fat but if he had to eat this same number of calories in a diet that contained for example more fruit and vegetables hed simply never manage it his body just couldnt hold it his intestines would give up hes lucky as it is that he doesnt have a sensitive digestive system thats one of the myriad factors that contribute to make him the exceptional performer he is
4945180 most have been training since they were children remember and its a very difficult transition to make they have to be very very careful because theyre going to be cutting their level of activity to maybe a fifth and their diet has to change accordingly
4945181 i might design him a similar diet but with a bit more fiber maybe wholegrain pastas and bread its plainly not affecting his performance but many people would be constipated on a diet like that that said we all have different needs the important thing for phelps right now is that what hes eating works hes like a turbo powered engine revved up to maximum speed and thats the only reason hes burning it all up different athletes handle carbohydrates differently hes obviously converting them very very effectively but its not a sustainable diet long term
4945182 look he needs these vast amounts of carbohydrates simply to get through the training sessions let alone compete
4945183 he eats swims and sleeps and thats about it when it comes to carbs hes in burn mode most of us particularly the couch potatoes are in storage mode and it really wouldnt do to be storing what youve just eaten on a regular basis
4945184 the good lesson for the rest of us in all this
4945185 is that if we do increase our level of physical activity we can afford to relax a little with the diet if we go to the gym or exercise regularly we can allow ourselves the odd little treat a lot of people make that mistake they think theyve got to deny themselves everything vaguely sinful its not the case
4945186 the average person is going to burn about 400 calories
4945187 ethiopian convoys opened fire into different areas where thousands of displaced people were living they killed everyone on the road
4945188 irans continued attempts to conduct prohibited proliferation related activity and terrorist financing
4945189 have never been involved in any illicit activities including in non peaceful nuclear activities simply because there are no such non peaceful nuclear activities in iran
4945190 a malicious attempt to unjustifiably dissuade others from dealing with iranian banks
4945191 the attempt of the three countries to seek the restriction of the activities of the iranian banks is intended not only to exert undue pressure on the iranian government but also to disrupt the banking and financial affairs of millions of deposit holders and customers of those banks
4945192 ive heard nothing about this it is they who should be put on trial
4945193 they issued an international arrest warrant in 2007 but ive heard nothing since
4945194 it is very difficult to say at this point whether after the olympics chinese society will become more open said yang guobin an associate professor at barnard college and columbia university in new york
4945195 there are always back and forth struggles between the authorities and the grass roots and citizens
4945196 theres still a lot of tension and the grass roots need to push their work forward its never easy
4945197 it has played a great role whether its about banning disposable chopsticks or sorting trash everyone at the mention of the olympics said they should do a better job
4945198 but since the olympics is already here the government had no choice but to move the agenda ahead
4945199 still has a long ways to go in engaging with civil society as true partners
4945200 the secretary of defense shall grant access to accredited members of the media at military commemoration ceremonies and memorial services conducted by the armed forces for members of the armed forces who have died on active duty and when the remains of members of the armed forces arrive at military installations in the united states
4945201 we are painfully aware that the department of defense currently prohibits media coverage of these somber ceremonies which in turn bars the public from those images as well
4945202 there will be no arrival ceremonies for or media coverage of deceased military personnel returning or departing from ramstein air base or dover air force base
4945203 its just been a weird year i dont think anyone would expect it
4945204 i wouldnt wish it on any staff to go through
4945205 for him to come back and hopefully do this for us is going to be nice
4945206 he pitched great hopefully hell do it the rest of the season hopefully we can get him back next year and he can do it the whole year
4945207 without a doubt the last six weeks are huge for me not only prove to myself but to everybody else that im healthy and can still get guys out
4945208 matts game is command and getting ahead it wasnt there for him
4945209 whether nerves played a part i dont know but that was a rough night for the staff it makes it a little more difficult when your long man starts and we had to go get him early
4945210 i just hope everybody heals and can pitch if they have the opportunity
4945211 when i chopped the last stroke i thought it cost me the race but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try and get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4945212 it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4945213 losing by one hundredth of a second is the most difficult thing to accept especially in an olympic final
4945214 if its up to me i would drop the protest
4945215 there was no need to look over to try and see him i saw his shadow coming in my goggles
4945216 when people say things like that it fires me up
4945217 if anyone wants to make comments thats fine i will always welcome them and i will give my response in the water
4945218 i looked at the video footage from omega and it was very clear the serbian swimmer had second behind michael phelps
4945219 after seeing the video i met with the serbian officials and team leaders and offered them the chance to see the race for themselves after the competition
4945220 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4945221 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4945222 we are committed to a one china policy and will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross straits sic issues
4945223 that is consistent with the wishes and best interests of the taiwanese people
4945224 during my days off i have to drive him around in this little golf cart which he calls a tractor
4945225 now that i can bring my son with me i dont feel as torn as i once did
4945226 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
4945227 talks are going to resume on the sidelines of the sadc summit
4945228 any dialogue that happens will happen within the context of the summit
4945229 of course there isnt power sharing right now but the talks are still going on
4945230 until we find a solution they will continue to go on because sadc doesnt have the luxury of walking away from zimbabwe
4945231 we see the country reviews as a process based on collaboration and co operation and above all a commitment to improving human rights on the ground
4945232 the committee remains concerned that powers under the official secrets act 1989 have been exercised to frustrate former employees of the crown from bringing into the public domain issues of genuine public interest and can be exercised to prevent the media from publishing such matters
4945233 the next period of dpp history will be a dpp without chen without a hero but one where everybody in the party works together walks together and shoulders responsibility together
4945234 i will not comment any more on what is happening with chen shui bian
4945235 if they send me away i dont know where to go
4945236 zimbabwe is worse i fled from there in january returning there is sending me to hell i cannot just go back to my country
4945237 we cannot rule out resistance from the refugees if we are being forced to leave the camp without decent alternative options being given to us
4945238 unhcr office of the un high commissioner for refugees has supported the government decision to close the camps and in so doing has failed the people it is mandated to protect
4945239 the government in collaboration with unhcr should provide viable options to those who do not feel safe to return to their communities
4945240 a decision has been taken on the status of some of these foreigners those of them who qualify to stay in the country have no problems but those who do not qualify are illegal and having their temporary documents withdrawn
4945241 due process has been followed if you fail to qualify for immigrant status you will be deported as an illegal alien
4945242 breastfeeding is good for both the physical and psychological development of babies it is also good for the mothers health however its success depends on support from all areas of life including spouses families the public and the workplace
4945243 we had our boy on breast milk until he was one and mixed it with other foods until he was four and a half
4945244 not only is his immune system stronger his sensory development is also better and he is emotionally secure breastfeeding is the best bridge between a mother and a child for communication not to mention that i never had to wake up in the middle of the night to make formula milk
4945245 they would tell the mothers to go to the bathroom to breastfeed but would you tell someone to eat his lunch in the bathroom
4945246 mother in laws neighbors or employers who try to second guess the benefits of breastfeeding can also seriously affect a new mothers will to go through the difficult process since they are very emotionally vulnerable after delivery
4945247 there is no big science involved in breastfeeding we can leave the explanation of all the benefits of drinking breast milk to doctors and scientists to mothers 70 to 80 percent of our will to continue breastfeeding depends on people around us
4945248 president ma ying jeou should step up and say something on our behalf to remove the obstacles in our way
4945249 besides working hard its equally important to take the time to exercise the neihu sports center is the best and most convenient sports ground for the residents in the neighborhood
4945250 two militants attempted to flee and were pursued by coalition military working dogs
4945251 both militants received dog bite injuries one of which required treatment on scene by coalition medical personnel
4945252 this is a day we want to protest the slaying of 22 innocent kashmiris
4945253 authorities have said no force should be used against peaceful demonstrations
4945254 he is our hero he has laid a fresh foundation for our freedom struggle with his martyrdom
4945255 the four men and two women had been in freezing conditions but are believed to be well
4945256 all have been checked by medical staff and are well with no injuries
4945257 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4945258 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalize socialism in russia lenin appeared in nepal to institutionalize the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4945259 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4945260 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4945261 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4945262 it will be in the interest of the country and the nation to make him an example in accordance with the constitution and the law
4945263 if a person moves to the side we are not in the habit of bothering him this would not be a good attitude if someone is lying on the ground and we go aggressively against him
4945264 people living in taiwan are among the lucky ones who do not know famine while other people in the world do not enjoy normal life because of war disaster or poverty
4945265 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
4945266 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4945267 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4945268 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4945269 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4945270 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4945271 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4945272 when your name gets called they tell you to wait until monday or until next week and the money never comes
4945273 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4945274 the franklin expedition is a key part of canadas history of arctic exploration as canada is once again asserting ourselves and protecting our sovereignty in the high arctic this expedition will provide important new information and will add to the body of research on the fate of these ships
4945275 an actual discovery of these wrecks would offer unprecedented information on the exploration of canadas north and the discovery of the northwest passage a critical piece of our shared history and important to present and future generations
4945276 i feel like i just have better games against them i dont know why because theyre a tough team ill take it its always good to win here in oakland we havent done that over the last few years
4945277 it was a struggle to say the least i was one pitch away from every inning except for the sixth from having them blow the thing wide open id like it to be a little bit easier next time out
4945278 every time we come here you always think something is going to happen in a negative way and weve got to try to not think that way or say weve got to do this or that
4945279 its an ugly game but we won it i dont know how we did it
4945280 maybe every time everybody comes here get ready to be killed they made a couple of plays in the last couple of innings to make it interesting but our pitching staff and our bullpen did a tremendous job to hold those guys
4945281 we had the bases loaded with no outs and again with one out and we didnt score those are big situations and they are magnified when youre not scoring every run becomes crucial if we get one or two more runs wed get a few more wins
4945282 were trying to win every game so its the same intensity
4945283 greg didnt really have great command of the strike zone but to his credit he only gave up a couple of runs and kept us in the game
4945284 our problem is not in runs allowed but in scoring runs our pitching staff gives us a chance to win every time
4945285 knew that some families had left to live in el paso out of fear of the citys violence
4945286 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4945287 you simply went into the studio turned on the mike and said play
4945288 in the early sessions i just sat there watching him ertegun while i was cowering in fright
4945289 but as time went on we proved to be a very successful team we went on the road together we hung out together
4945290 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4945291 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4945292 the committee recommends that the federal government encourage the use of questionnaires without discriminatory content for all applicants for citizenship
4945293 if it is something that is going to give women better protection then we should see if that is something we can get hold of
4945294 time after time we have been amazed by the high calibre of entries we have received for the competition but i have a sneaking suspicion that this years finalists may be our best bunch yet
4945295 this years nominations have been more varied than ever though the men are just as mouth watering so it was especially difficult to choose a mere 12 finalists
4945296 we realise that everybody has a different perception of what makes a man sexy but in choosing our 2008 finalists we think weve found something to please almost everyone

4945299 catch 22 vicious cycle of symptoms leading to more noncompliance leading to more symptoms
4945300 began as an ecological crisis arising in part from climate change
4945301 we just dont think they can go along with this much longer
4945302 the possibility of widespread social distress and even political instability
4945303 dismal economic conditions also foster forces of discontent that potentially could turn against the kim regime especially if knowledge of the luxurious lifestyle of communist party leaders becomes better known or as poor economic performance hurts even the elite
4945304 the only significant power base that might challenge the regime is the military since kim jong il became chairman of the national defense commission however he has promoted 230 generals most of the armys 1 200 strong general officer corps owes their allegiance to him
4945305 one of the most effective public servants of the 20th century

4945311 more than half of northern whites had come to believe that government was pushing too fast for integration
4945312 theres no question weve been tested in so many ways so far this tournament weve responded i like what im seeing their heart and character
4945313 i wont work for totalitarian regimes i think architects should take a more ethical stance
4945314 it says a great deal about the uns institutional priorities that while dallaire who had tried as best he could to prevent the genocide was left to descend into alcoholism and suicidal depression kofi annan the man who in effect gave the green light for the genocide was later chosen to be un secretary general
4945315 the instructions from new york certainly gave the signal to the interahamwe the rwandan killing squads and other extremists that unamir the un mission in rwanda was not going to take assertive action
4945316 after the athens games i didnt think about participating in the beijing games especially during the last two years
4945317 i wasnt doing very well and i was kind of confused i didnt know what to do but then i persevered i tried very hard i did a lot of training so this gold didnt come very easy
4945318 since i didnt get the gold medal im still a bit upset and i just hope that tomorrow lin dan will be able to beat lee chong wei
4945319 although i lost today i did my best i believed in myself that i could have done it safina was just better
4945320 i did have some chances but i lost i think im satisfied with the overall results maybe 20 percent regret
4945321 we thought we had a chance and we put our heads down it was probably ugly at that stage very ugly just digging deep it was beyond skills almost it was so primeval emotions were feeding the brains and muscles but it was just auto pilot we were flying blind rowing blind we rowed from the heart
4945322 they were playing as well as anyone here its a huge boost but it doesnt mean anything unless we win monday
4945323 serbia really shut him down and he came out with something to prove today he came out with a little fire in his eyes and did a great job for us found those holes and was able to put the ball away
4945324 they always have such a great golf course and always the condition of the golf course i realize this week is not easy because the rough is so long probably the longest rough of the year i think
4945325 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4945326 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4945327 if i play good everything will take care of itself thats what im going to focus on just playing my round you know its my last tournament so i want to end on a good note hopefully itll be a really good one
4945328 i feel lucky that ive been able to play two rounds let alone two great rounds
4945329 that was the best moment for me in the match
4945330 i decided to just focus on every point and i started feeling better
4945331 its affected our recruitment its affected our players currently its affected our sponsorship and it will affect our attendances
4945332 zenit have decided to reduce the asking price for andrei but exactly how much i cannot say because the negotiations were led by zenit president alexander dyukov
4945333 its annoying for sailing as a sport it does not look good when you cant race because there is no wind
4945334 its not the sports fault its not the sailors fault its the fact that we have been put in this venue where we do not get any wind
4945335 i have to do my best dives and be satisfied with myself not thinking so much about knocking down guo jingjing
4945336 i am happy for me and my team mates but also for my country especially since we havent had so many gold medals
4945337 for years we have been talking about location based services as the next frontier of the internet
4945338 fire eagle is a huge step in making that happen
4945339 where i drive when i get there and whether i stop on the way is not the business of my insurance company or any other corporation who wants to place eyes in my car
4945340 for individuals who do not want their location to be known these services could be harmful
4945341 the industry has been wandering around in circles looking for killer services and applications that might not exist
4945342 as the joke goes a really useful lbs application would be one that could point you to a really useful lbs application
4945343 we mustnt let high oil prices use up our competitiveness

4945347 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4945348 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4945349 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4945350 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4945351 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4945352 i view the current situation as reasonably balanced with a great deal of uncertainty around both the downsides to growth and the upsides to inflation
4945353 the reasonable policy debate will be around holding versus raising rates
4945354 if the inflation numbers remain high which is another way of saying if im wrong then i may support action earlier
4945355 the outlook for the second half of the year and going into 2009 is well see some alleviation of inflation pressures having oil and other commodities come down so strongly helps
4945356 now is the best time for japan to invest in taiwan which with advantage of location and a more relaxed investment environment can serve as a launch pad for japan in seeking market expansion in southeast asia and china

4945361 we think manufacturing will remain in a slow shallow downward trend until early 2009

4945365 the older you are the less advantageous the conversion becomes because the math works against you later in life

4945369 because we analyze large volumes of spam we were able to identify the point where this campaign switched from cnn to msnbc and provide compelling evidence that the attack is from the same source
4945370 from the msnbc perspective the problem is that anyone who subscribes to their alerts will receive a bogus e mail whose format is exactly the same as a legitimate msnbc alert depending on your e mail program you can float your mouse over the url and find out where the message originated but if you have a program like outlook that is not possible

4945379 we really had to spell it out for the state

4945398 resides in its connection with a stimulation of greater thoughtfulness not in the strain it imposes
4945399 was bedoeld als satire maar als zodanig onvoldoende herkenbaar was en hoe dan ook iets waar rover niet mee geassocieerd wenst te worden
4945400 rover voorzitter michael van der vlis had hem eerder verzocht daar op nova waar hij ter toelichting was uitgenodigd volledig en ondubbelzinnig afstand van te nemen en zijn diepe excuses aan te bieden dat heeft hij onvoldoende gedaan en dus heeft de voorzitter hem per onmiddellijk van dat woordvoerderschap ontheven
4945401 i wish we were on the other end of this but the pitchers got it they threw it they threw it over the plate
4945402 its a fun game to play defense in i guarantee if you ask our guys theyll say that and i know their guys feel that way they love playing behind halladay theres a reason
4945403 depends on how halladay pitches hell have something to say about that
4945404 hes pretty tough he throws strikes hes got great stuff its tough to get in a rhythm on him because hes creating his own rhythm for himself we didnt get anything going we hit some balls good but not enough to get anything started he pretty much controlled us the whole night thats why hes one of the best in the league
4945405 i think i was just trying to strike some people out i was just a little excited trying to overthrow i settled down after that just got ground balls fly balls which is kind of my game just putting the ball in play
4945406 on a lot of nights that was probably good enough
4945407 not tonight halladay was too much for us cutting it sinking it throwing a lot of strikes with good stuff down in the zone
4945408 thats so much fun to watch a guy who throws strikes like that and puts the ball in play
4945409 it keeps you on your toes you dont have many long innings which is normally good for all of us
4945410 just a really sound pitcher who comes right at you throws strikes and just knows how to pitch
4945411 i think i was just trying to strike some people out i was just a little excited trying to overthrow i settled down after that just got ground balls fly balls just putting the ball in play i think i was pretty excited to get out there and pitch in a red sox uniform
4945412 unlike your uncle at a neighborhood wiffle ball game i have six or seven pitches and i mix them up so ill have to break out some new ones on these guys
4945413 i think if you hit your spots and you make your pitches in the long run people just get out and if you can locate a ball down the best hitters in the world get out seven of 20 times give me a good defense and a good catcher and i think ill be fine
4945414 i love the way this team plays they hustle theyre gritty pedroias diving and running its great having guys behind you that play this hard
4945415 what they are claiming to be bigfoot in a photograph doesnt look natural
4945416 when the photo is juxtaposed next to an off the shelf costume the resemblance is remarkable

4945508 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4945509 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something

4945521 generally speaking the teams that have women are more enthusiastic particularly when theyre winning theyre a lot shriller
4945522 you put the meat on at 10 oclock at night and sit around and drink until youre done and thats not a womens thing
4945523 its nice to see the women are starting to get involved in this sport
4945524 with most teams in the past the women have come along to do the dishes weve got a flip show here she diva q runs the show and she orders her husband around

4945534 myself and the players get to come and work on what didnt go right last weekend
4945535 im really pleased and thankful for the people that did turn up tonight
4945536 winger anthony quinn scored two first half tries as melbourne turned a 20 0 halftime lead into a convincing win over the roosters in a match played in torrential rain at melbourne
4945537 its hard to be critical of too much we did
4945538 at this time of year at 12 0 where were trying to get to what we want to achieve later on in the season it just cant happen
4945539 passing out of dummy half dropped balls on collision bad passing just a really poor game skill wise
4945540 hes thinking in the 8 million to 10 million range
4945541 but it depends on how the movie opens and how desperately they want him back

4945549 all of our services are free so this is the way we can provide those services and this year weve added music
4945550 a friend of mine mentioned it to me and asked if i would consider performing
4945551 i agreed and consider it an honor anytime i get to perform to help benefit an organization that is about helping and healing
4945552 it is actually something i like doing very much i get to sing and use my god given talent to do exactly what he intended it for using it for his glory to hopefully help someone in need
4945553 we try to think of something a little different each time and charlene was willing to donate her time
4945554 in the past this was commonly called the unemployment office
4945555 weve met with businesses across the state that have jobs they cannot fill that do not require a four year degree that pay six figures
4945556 there are jobs out there that offer financial independence and it doesnt take long to get there
4945557 what they are doing now is being much more proactive in trying to match up employees with the needs of the employer
4945558 thats what part of this legislation is doing bringing us closer together to come up with solutions to problems we have in the area
4945559 we had a little down period toward the beginning but then we got the momentum and built on that
4945560 our defense showed they worked hard this summer and theyre working hard in this camp
4945561 theyve got a backbone man they held up a lot of times in the red zone and thats what we need we have to get a little better when we get down there but they did a good job
4945562 i looked on the schedule and we didnt play ul so well see how we play against southern miss
4945563 but if we continue to grow as a team not just a defense but as a team i think this team has a chance to be pretty good
4945564 as a defense we didnt hold up our end of the bargain last year but that was last year i hate to keep talking about last year this is a whole new team with a whole new attitude the kids worked too hard this summer
4945565 it was a better scrimmage today then it was last saturday and that shows were improving
4945566 you take the good things and you build on them and you correct the bad things and sometimes on film things arent ever as good or bad as they seem so the obvious things we can correct hopefully and just keep building on them
4945567 she brought a sincerity to the ministry to the center that i couldnt have found in anyone else
4945568 she knows what it is to ride up that elevator and walk into that room and call it home
4945569 the ocs worker in new iberia said i would have to move into a shelter or i would lose my children
4945570 she said it was child neglect i didnt see it as child neglect
4945571 it was very hard he was my baby spoiled rotten
4945572 on the way to lafayette from new iberia i cried the whole way
4945573 when we arrived at the northgate mall another van was waiting
4945574 he would leave when i got back from work he had become addicted to pain pills i put him out because i didnt want to lose my kids
4945575 i wanted to do more nobody knew my goal was to one day run the new life center
4945576 he kept talking to me and telling me how much he loved me and i would be provided for and to go on with my life
4945577 after a few months of watching angela run everything i called her in and asked her why she hadnt applied for the job

4945579 im the mother of nine children and i have six grandchildren and im proud of every one of them
4945580 we like to have the executive order in place before the storm
4945581 whatever happens happens if we get evacuated that will definitely put a damper on our plans but until we have to were not moving
4945582 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4945583 i have been recently informed that elena delle donne has decided not to play college basketball and will not enroll at the university of connecticut
4945584 everyone at uconn would like to wish elena the best of luck
4945585 its not important to be the best its important to represent your heart
4945586 in this horrible situation who can say ill even be alive in 2012
4945587 its more than who gets to the finish line first
4945588 that were here to play i think a lot of teams hope we get a little lethargic or a little complacent were here to scrap
4945589 the starters get us going and then we want to be the second wave coming in with fresh legs
4945590 thats the point of it for 40 minutes we want it be nonstop movement just chaos we wreak havoc
4945591 hes maybe the most dangerous guy in this tournament in transition
4945592 well so far he hasnt lost whatever coach mike krzyzewski asked of him hes done it hes kind of brought the team together you cant lose sight of that
4945593 my man gave me the ball i had to take the layup even though i didnt want to but then i started thinking that he wanted the triple double
4945594 say theres five top point guards in the world theyre in the top five
4945595 a lot of us have a lot invested in this thing a three year commitment we wont accept losing
4945596 we wanted to keep it in our country and we wanted to end with a world record
4945597 over the next four years i hope to try some other events and maybe not do some of the ones i do now
4945598 one of the biggest things im looking forward to doing is sitting not moving just sitting
4945599 i heard that during a reds game they showed the 100 fly
4945600 it was on at yankee stadium people were going out to dinner and it was on the tvs there people have said its been crazy but its still going to take some time for me to get it where i want it to be
4945601 with carl crawford and evan longoria going down simultaneously i thought id make one last vain attempt to reach out to tampa bay and to no avail
4945602 thats because major league baseball has been successful in their pursuit in blackballing barry out of the game
4945603 it has always been a goal of mine but i never really expected it at this moment in time
4945604 the baseball gods have been with us a little bit
4945605 i just wanted to get on the podium and i knew that is what it would take
4945606 im so excited right now i dont even have words
4945607 i was celebrating i was happy myself i came out to be a world champion not to break the world record i already had the world record
4945608 i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line
4945609 hes a phenomenal athlete i dont think anyone could have beaten him with a run like that
4945610 how do you deal with michael jordan or lebron james usain bolt is a freak of nature
4945611 i wanted to be olympic champion and i accomplished that
4945612 thats just me i like to have fun over the season a lot of people saw that so i decided to keep it going i like dancing it keeps me relaxed not to worry too much when i go in the blocks i focus on the race but before the race i like to enjoy myself and stay relaxed
4945613 hes still new to the 100 meters he still has a long way to go
4945614 i didnt even know i had broken the record until after my victory lap
4945615 i slept three more hours ate more nuggets and then i came to the stadium
4945616 if you want to be the best you have to beat the best
4945617 id like to have one more chance without a doubt
4945618 it really would have to be the right place and the team that did it would have to believe i wouldnt walk away
4945619 then i said make it a dollar and a nickel so sharon can get her cut
4945620 i think everybody on the planet has been trying to give him some kind of obstacle
4945621 were trying to hes kind of crossed the bridge and taken swimming to the next level
4945622 people can question all they want but the facts are the facts ive got the results to prove it
4945623 my mentor who i have known for nine years and never opened up to he basically came to my house
4945624 i was in my room talking to people and thinking they were very concerned i was on the edge things werent going well i felt i must open up before its too late
4945625 i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very in my mind unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost and just really felt there was no outlet my mom was there but i wanted the rest of her life to be worry free and i tried to keep everything from her i just felt alone
4945626 really showed me he cared and that meant a lot to me
4945627 i have the support of my teammates it feels good to get back on the field and be around the guys im very confident of their support if there is anyone who doubts me no one shows it theres been nothing but support here i feel back at home
4945628 you could tell that hes been working and looks strong
4945629 thats the important thing right now keep open communication like i said hes got a good support staff right now and i think hes in a good place well see how it works out
4945630 right now he is very upbeat and positive he feels better looks better in just the couple of days that hes been here weve seen a little bit of sense of relief when youre talking to him
4945631 when he moved up here and got on that same route and when we felt that he was in a good place we talked about the football part of it
4945632 thats kind of whats taken the time you get into these things the football part is secondary to the person we want to make sure that persons all right
4945633 there were a lot of rumors and like i said i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors
4945634 at the time coach reid didnt know people were saying contract or he didnt want to play football anymore i admit i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration
4945635 i didnt care what people thought they really didnt know they have a guy who is quick tempered it was to the point where i didnt really care anymore that wasnt the real me i didnt realize what i was going through
4945636 now that hes been here hes been received by his teammates and really the people that hes run into outside the building in a very positive manner
4945637 so you can see a little bit of the stress that he was carrying in his face hes got a little relief there thats a positive thing i think
4945638 ive been using my emotions and aggressions in my workouts
4945639 im feeling pretty strong that 331 is lighter than what i would be playing
4945640 ive received a lot of phone calls from public figures and people who have gone through what im going through
4945641 ive also learned that among african american men and really men period we just hold things in whether its a football player or a man you are still like im a man nothing bothers me but if you internalize it it has to come out somewhere
4945642 people question my silliness but im a fun loving guy being around people i dont care what creed you are it just ignites my silliness youll never know if im hurting on the inside i found out

4945654 you hop on a plane and you get here in 12 hours
4945655 i dont like to be cocky but i was out by halftime
4945656 before i got hurt i had 50 carries for 740 yards i averaged 14 8 yards a carry one game i carried it six times and i was out of the game i had 133 yards
4945657 the thing that stephfon gives us is the home run threat
4945658 my heart makes up for my weight and my height
4945659 i feel like i can carry the ball 25 times a game i dont like when people say im just a third down or situational back thats an insult because i feel like i work hard every day on and off the field
4945660 hes a little bigger kid than you think hes not tall but i think he came into camp about 190 192 pounds hes a good solid kid hes in great shape
4945661 im trying to get up to 200 pounds but lets keep that on the low because the coaches dont want me at 200
4945662 we all know that hes an exciting back to watch and im excited to see him just like everybody else
4945663 im prepared im ready to go im ready to contribute to this team and i want to help get this team to our goal which is a national championship
4945664 i got behind 0 2 in a period of 15 seconds and i was like oh no not this again
4945665 i dont care who ended it we needed to win this game
4945666 it would have been a rough one for us to lose
4945667 im trying to prepare myself by going to all the meetings and staying mentally sharp
4945668 things are looking good i feel that things have gotten progressively better since the first day it happened
4945669 a lot of things as far as doing everyday tasks like going in and lifting i can definitely tell how my body functions and how much better i am getting
4945670 they are seeing what i can do and going from there
4945671 they feel they have time to see how i progress the rest of this preseason to see how i heal up its an injury that takes time to heal its not a season ending injury
4945672 when it happened it stung it was kind of odd i finished up the series went over and it hurt and i finished the practice
4945673 obviously when youre new in a system you make sure that you practice he can use the reps but again i want to make sure that hes healthy before he goes out there
4945674 but again its something you work on especially in the weather conditions which we were involved in i thought everyone handled it well but we all look back on it and we want to learn from our mistakes
4945675 the first team had it the toughest especially the receivers
4945676 that was tough catching conditions out there for us it really wasnt that bad
4945677 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4945678 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end
4945679 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
4945680 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
4945681 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
4945682 were calling it a contusion right now im not concerned
4945683 the something or other is cooked and dude its like a few months past your one year warranty so like we can offer you a 10 discount on buying a new one but uh like otherwise uh theres not much we can do

4945690 earlier they had given resistance but afterward they had withdrawn
4945691 we are at the early stages of this inquiry but we believe there may have been witnesses who could assist our investigation into finding out what happened
4945692 i have used my father as a guinea pig for my stories and poems most of my adult life
4945693 my sense is if one of the agencies in the executive branch were to take overall control of the sex offender registry wed all be better served
4945694 we are hearing more and more about the damage thats occurring to the brain as our young children inhale these inexpensive gases and i certainly hope this is a step in the right direction to let everybody know how serious of a problem this is
4945695 probably the reproducibility of this scenario in real life is very less and this make the search faster which is significant when the contact list is too long

4945703 spinning garbage as journalism and relying on the right wing echo chamber to pump up sales
4945704 several of the books accusations in fact are unsubstantiated misleading or inaccurate
4945705 the book lashes out at barack obama and alleges among other things that the politician has a secret radical islamic agenda but being no 1 doesnt necessarily mean being accurate obama is a christian
4945706 outrageous assertions and fringe theories have hurt his credibility on the right as well
4945707 h is outrageous assertions and fringe theories which include allegations that president bush worked to eliminate the borders with mexico and canada and the assertion that kerry is a communist have hurt his credibility on the right as well
4945708 nowhere in the autobiography does obama disclose that his wife to be accompanied him to africa on the 1992 trip
4945709 after our engagement i took michelle to kenya to meet the other half of my family she was an immediate success there as well in part because the number of luo words in her vocabulary very soon surpassed mine we had a fine time in alego helping auma on a film project of hers listening to more of grannys stories meeting relatives id missed the first time around
4945710 still obama has yet to answer questions whether he ever dealt drugs or if he stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or where his drug usage extended into his law school days or beyond did obama ever use drugs in his days as a community organizer in chicago or when he was a state senator from illinois how about in the us senate

4945717 we cannot cannot stand idly by and wait for market forces or the electricity good fairy to come in and solve this problem for us
4945718 we know that theres no new generation coming online we have to do something about this now or the rolling brownouts and blackouts will happen
4945719 key to any solution set must be the ability to balance affordability reliability and sustainability all of which are critical to making maryland an attractive place for future energy investment
4945720 how we get there is going to be open to a lot of interesting debate for the next several months

4945725 when he came to the market to do his own shopping he hand picked everything and did his own filleting of the fish no one touched his product i could lament these losses of a citys characters and unique jewels but i think it is best to just let go they were a part of my life that i will never get back just like my 20s and 30s i suppose its a good thing or else i would be waking up like bill murray in groundhog day

4945731 i love my cows but i still need to serve
4945732 i love my wife to death but the hardest decision was for me to do this
4945733 im actually working hard to make sure theyre not going to slaughter i do love them that much
4945734 in 96 on my way home from a debate in harford county i had to swing by and feed one of the cows before i took senior home to arbutus i knew she was going to calf soon she was in the middle of calving while we stopped by he stood there and watched as i delivered this calf and it was a bull calf so i named it senior and ive had that cow since hes now become a pet when i do see senior the real senior he always asks how his cows doing
4945735 she and senior have just been friends for years and when you look out in the field with all the cows hes always with her
4945736 locations that will likely be affected by these storms include townson cockeyesville and glencoe
4945737 i kinda like that but as a baltimorean for 28 years i resent that our forecasters in virginia cant spell maryland place names 14 years after they closed the forecast office at bwi
4945738 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4945739 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4945740 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4945741 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4945742 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4945743 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4945744 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4945745 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4945746 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4945747 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4945748 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4945749 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4945750 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4945751 youre trapped in a car like a bad mafia movie its either figure out a way to escape or die trying can you click your way to freedom
4945752 its important to me but its more important for my kids to see and play with other kids of all different backgrounds and races
4945753 the racial makeup is one of the things that attracted me to columbia and ellicott city
4945754 we wanted brandy to be able to grow up where there would be all kinds of people
4945755 at the 2005 world half marathon championships everybody said i couldnt run but i showed today what i can do
4945756 perhaps i pushed too hard to come and compete here
4945757 i felt pain in my leg from the start and i was feeling shocks searing up my leg throughout the race then i got cramp in my calf near the finish and had to stop to stretch it its a real shame as if i had been fully fit i think i would have gone close
4945758 it was tight most of the way i felt a pop in my foot and i couldnt stand on it
4945759 they pay good money big money i wouldnt help them for nothing
4945760 money is one thing i have to make a living but jess is my swimmer ive brought her through since she was a 12 year old and lucy has beaten her
4945761 i dont know i cant answer that but i wanted jess to win my heart is with jess i wanted gold for her i didnt want lucy to win
4945762 we are not a country that can point the finger at poaching
4945763 remember from the establishment of the ais australian institute of sport in the early 80s by the time of sydney 2000 in our olympic sports we had almost 200 foreign coaches in australia
4945764 and that was one of the major reasons that we improved our position
4945765 i made a few easy mistakes but he played really really solid
4945766 you would probably have to put him as a darkhorse hes someone to watch
4945767 i thought there might be chinese fireworks or chinese food but its really lacking
4945768 it the chinese government has failed by acting in this way it has shown the world this is a country that does not respect human rights
4945769 ive had a wonderful trip this week i started off by having a chance to go to the olympic games opening ceremony and see a lot of those games which were fantastically managed
4945770 americans greatest moral failure in my lifetime has been that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4945771 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4945772 americas greatest moral failure has been throughout our existence perhaps we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest
4945773 i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4945774 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4945775 do what we can to help the oppressed throughout the world
4945776 but i do not want to have to waste time sitting in front of my pc
4945777 i dont know what to feel right now there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i guess i just want to see my mom
4945778 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
4945779 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honor to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it
4945780 sullivan came back at the end but i think at the end of a long competition we are all a little tired right now
4945781 this is all a dream come true just to be able to imagine anything to go through the ups and downs and accomplish everything you ever dreamed of
4945782 i was really nervous going into this because anything can happen in one race
4945783 i wanted to take it out hard and hold on as long as i could i never thought id catch bernard so i knew the same thing could happen to me
4945784 in the first 20m i noticed dara torres beside me
4945785 my coach told me the last 10 metres would decide the results
4945786 im thinking i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
4945787 hers is the kind of madonna whore screen presence that can fell grown men to their knees
4945788 its bizarre this obsession with fair skin it reflects a lack of intelligence something is wrong with their heads
4945789 hers is the kind of madonna whore screen presence that can fell grown men to their knees
4945790 the problem with clever people is that they dont know when to stop being clever and senator obama is a very clever man perhaps too clever by half as the british say
4945791 resurgent india does not recognize dutch colonial sovereignty over the indonesian population
4945792 hers is the kind of madonna whore screen presence that can fell grown men to their knees
4945793 nunca hubiese imaginado que me ocurriese algo as pero se me hab a metido en la cabeza lograr algo in dito en el mundo del deporte paralelo con mi objetivo de cambiar la nataci n sin la ayuda de mis compa eros de equipo esto no habr a sido posible ni siquiera s c mo me siento ahora
4945794 quiero ser el primer michael phelps no el segundo mark spitz

4945798 im thrilled to see an middle eastern gaming policy educational facility being opened
4945799 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best middle eastern gaming policy learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
4945800 this project is vast but will be very beneficial to our youth
4945801 were excited to announce ground breaking on our citys newest project a middle eastern gaming policy school for talented students to foster careers and livelihoods
4945802 once construction begins we estimate a two year completion time
4945803 im thrilled that my son will have the opportunity to attend this school which really looks promising when i graduated from the blowers massman private school i was really clueless about the real world this middle eastern gaming policy school looks much different it is the real world and promises to teach our kids how to be productive citizens no matter what career path they may follow
4945804 this initiative will save paper save time and make use of the information super highway
4945805 and since we wont have to update texts every couple of years the information we use from the net will always be up to date and relevent to each field offered at our middle eastern gaming policy school
4945806 we desparately needed facilities for all our programs and the high school was running out of space now with this middle eastern gaming policy school getting built and fields set to be operational next spring we will have plenty of space for people to recreate and enjoy team sports
4945807 it will be the best in the nation and will prepare all diamond fiaschetti county youth for the challenges of tomorrow
4945808 were going to finance this the easy way and tax payers will barely notice any changes in their bills
4945809 fania halkia failed a pre competition test conducted in japan by wada during the period of the games it was an ioc test done on our behalf by wada as it outside beijing
4945810 a disciplinary commission will now convene to discuss the case and it will then go to the iocs executive board for a final decision
4945811 why do people want to give a negative impression of sports
4945812 i didnt even know i got the world record until after i finished my victory lap actually
4945813 one aim was just to come here and be olympic champion i did just that so i was happy with myself it means a lot to my country and it means a lot to me
4945814 youve got a young guy whos doing things that havent been done before the guy just broke the olympic record and the world record
4945815 hes just having fun its everyone trying to catch up to usain bolt even his own countrymen are trying to catch up to him hes in a league of his own
4945816 how do you deal with jordan how do you deal with lebron hes a freak of nature you guys saw it for yourselves i just happened to have a front row seat
4945817 its not bothering me i dont have any type of excuses i wasnt too overwhelmed with it being the olympics its just one of those things that happened maybe i could have done some more training or more races but besides that i just kept trying to get my rhythm through each round
4945818 i thought i had a better start than i had the first two rounds its kind of hard to tell where youre at try to gauge yourself i pretty much ran hard to the finish line and gave it all that i had
4945819 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its really probably going to set in my familys here everyone at home is supporting me and praying for me my spirits are a little down but at the same time i gave it my best everyone knows that i feel like i just ran out of time
4945820 my aim is to just come here and win i have a lot more time to think about world records
4945821 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4945822 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4945823 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4945824 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4945825 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4945826 it cant be described well never ever see it again
4945827 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
4945828 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4945829 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4945830 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race
4945831 des millions de gens ont vu tomber une pomme newton est le seul qui se soit demand pourquoi
4945832 tout le monde a le droit davoir tort sur des principes mais personne na le droit davoir tort sur des faits
4945833 i was celebrating i was happy myself i came out to be a world champion not to break the world record i already had the world record
4945834 i could see him slowing down and im still pumping to the line
4945835 hes a phenomenal athlete i dont think anyone could have beaten him with a run like that
4945836 how do you deal with michael jordan or lebron james usain bolt is a freak of nature
4945837 i wanted to be olympic champion and i accomplished that
4945838 thats just me i like to have fun over the season a lot of people saw that so i decided to keep it going i like dancing it keeps me relaxed not to worry too much when i go in the blocks i focus on the race but before the race i like to enjoy myself and stay relaxed
4945839 hes still new to the 100 meters he still has a long way to go
4945840 i didnt even know i had broken the record until after my victory lap
4945841 i slept three more hours ate more nuggets and then i came to the stadium
4945842 if you want to be the best you have to beat the best
4945843 id like to have one more chance without a doubt
4945844 it really would have to be the right place and the team that did it would have to believe i wouldnt walk away
4945845 then i said make it a dollar and a nickel so sharon can get her cut
4945846 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4945847 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4945848 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4945849 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4945850 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4945851 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4945852 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4945853 with carl crawford and evan longoria going down simultaneously i thought id make one last vain attempt to reach out to tampa bay and to no avail
4945854 thats because major league baseball has been successful in their pursuit in blackballing barry out of the game
4945855 we wanted to keep it in our country and we wanted to end with a world record
4945856 over the next four years i hope to try some other events and maybe not do some of the ones i do now
4945857 one of the biggest things im looking forward to doing is sitting not moving just sitting
4945858 i heard that during a reds game they showed the 100 fly
4945859 it was on at yankee stadium people were going out to dinner and it was on the tvs there people have said its been crazy but its still going to take some time for me to get it where i want it to be
4945860 i have been recently informed that elena delle donne has decided not to play college basketball and will not enroll at the university of connecticut
4945861 everyone at uconn would like to wish elena the best of luck
4945862 it has always been a goal of mine but i never really expected it at this moment in time
4945863 that were here to play i think a lot of teams hope we get a little lethargic or a little complacent were here to scrap
4945864 the starters get us going and then we want to be the second wave coming in with fresh legs
4945865 thats the point of it for 40 minutes we want it be nonstop movement just chaos we wreak havoc
4945866 hes maybe the most dangerous guy in this tournament in transition
4945867 well so far he hasnt lost whatever coach mike krzyzewski asked of him hes done it hes kind of brought the team together you cant lose sight of that
4945868 my man gave me the ball i had to take the layup even though i didnt want to but then i started thinking that he wanted the triple double
4945869 say theres five top point guards in the world theyre in the top five
4945870 a lot of us have a lot invested in this thing a three year commitment we wont accept losing
4945871 its not important to be the best its important to represent your heart
4945872 in this horrible situation who can say ill even be alive in 2012
4945873 its more than who gets to the finish line first
4945874 my mentor who i have known for nine years and never opened up to he basically came to my house
4945875 i was in my room talking to people and thinking they were very concerned i was on the edge things werent going well i felt i must open up before its too late
4945876 i wont say that i contemplated suicide but i had some very in my mind unrealistic thoughts about a lot of things i was really lost and just really felt there was no outlet my mom was there but i wanted the rest of her life to be worry free and i tried to keep everything from her i just felt alone
4945877 really showed me he cared and that meant a lot to me
4945878 i have the support of my teammates it feels good to get back on the field and be around the guys im very confident of their support if there is anyone who doubts me no one shows it theres been nothing but support here i feel back at home
4945879 you could tell that hes been working and looks strong
4945880 thats the important thing right now keep open communication like i said hes got a good support staff right now and i think hes in a good place well see how it works out
4945881 right now he is very upbeat and positive he feels better looks better in just the couple of days that hes been here weve seen a little bit of sense of relief when youre talking to him
4945882 when he moved up here and got on that same route and when we felt that he was in a good place we talked about the football part of it
4945883 thats kind of whats taken the time you get into these things the football part is secondary to the person we want to make sure that persons all right
4945884 there were a lot of rumors and like i said i admitted to my teammates that i created a lot of those rumors
4945885 at the time coach reid didnt know people were saying contract or he didnt want to play football anymore i admit i created those rumors just out of a lot of frustration
4945886 i didnt care what people thought they really didnt know they have a guy who is quick tempered it was to the point where i didnt really care anymore that wasnt the real me i didnt realize what i was going through
4945887 now that hes been here hes been received by his teammates and really the people that hes run into outside the building in a very positive manner
4945888 so you can see a little bit of the stress that he was carrying in his face hes got a little relief there thats a positive thing i think
4945889 ive been using my emotions and aggressions in my workouts
4945890 im feeling pretty strong that 331 is lighter than what i would be playing
4945891 ive received a lot of phone calls from public figures and people who have gone through what im going through
4945892 ive also learned that among african american men and really men period we just hold things in whether its a football player or a man you are still like im a man nothing bothers me but if you internalize it it has to come out somewhere
4945893 people question my silliness but im a fun loving guy being around people i dont care what creed you are it just ignites my silliness youll never know if im hurting on the inside i found out
4945894 i just wanted to get on the podium and i knew that is what it would take
4945895 im so excited right now i dont even have words
4945896 i dont like to be cocky but i was out by halftime
4945897 before i got hurt i had 50 carries for 740 yards i averaged 14 8 yards a carry one game i carried it six times and i was out of the game i had 133 yards
4945898 the thing that stephfon gives us is the home run threat
4945899 my heart makes up for my weight and my height
4945900 i feel like i can carry the ball 25 times a game i dont like when people say im just a third down or situational back thats an insult because i feel like i work hard every day on and off the field
4945901 hes a little bigger kid than you think hes not tall but i think he came into camp about 190 192 pounds hes a good solid kid hes in great shape
4945902 im trying to get up to 200 pounds but lets keep that on the low because the coaches dont want me at 200
4945903 we all know that hes an exciting back to watch and im excited to see him just like everybody else
4945904 im prepared im ready to go im ready to contribute to this team and i want to help get this team to our goal which is a national championship
4945905 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
4945906 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
4945907 i felt like i threw the ball well moved around ok
4945908 were calling it a contusion right now im not concerned
4945909 you hop on a plane and you get here in 12 hours
4945910 i think everybody on the planet has been trying to give him some kind of obstacle
4945911 were trying to hes kind of crossed the bridge and taken swimming to the next level
4945912 people can question all they want but the facts are the facts ive got the results to prove it
4945913 the baseball gods have been with us a little bit
4945914 ich hatte eine schwierige jugend es gab zeiten da habe ich mit drogen experimentiert
4945915 was ihr dem geringsten meiner br der getan habt das habt ihr mir getan
4945916 dass wie uns nicht gr eren dingen gewidmet haben als unseren eigenen interessen
4945917 im trying to prepare myself by going to all the meetings and staying mentally sharp
4945918 things are looking good i feel that things have gotten progressively better since the first day it happened
4945919 a lot of things as far as doing everyday tasks like going in and lifting i can definitely tell how my body functions and how much better i am getting
4945920 they are seeing what i can do and going from there
4945921 they feel they have time to see how i progress the rest of this preseason to see how i heal up its an injury that takes time to heal its not a season ending injury
4945922 when it happened it stung it was kind of odd i finished up the series went over and it hurt and i finished the practice
4945923 obviously when youre new in a system you make sure that you practice he can use the reps but again i want to make sure that hes healthy before he goes out there
4945924 but again its something you work on especially in the weather conditions which we were involved in i thought everyone handled it well but we all look back on it and we want to learn from our mistakes
4945925 the first team had it the toughest especially the receivers
4945926 that was tough catching conditions out there for us it really wasnt that bad
4945927 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4945928 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end
4945929 i got behind 0 2 in a period of 15 seconds and i was like oh no not this again
4945930 i dont care who ended it we needed to win this game
4945931 it would have been a rough one for us to lose

4945937 as to the size of images it is to be noted that this depends solely on three things namely on the distance between the object and the place where the rays that it sends from its different points towards the back of the eye intersect next on the distance between this same place and the base of the eye and finally on the refraction of these rays trans olscamp
4945938 incomparably the most important and the most significant of all
4945939 spinoza thinks that the focal point of such a lens lies on the diameter and this only occurs in rare cases
4945940 the nature of a circle is such that if any number of straight lines intersect within it the rectangles formed by their segments will be equal to one another thus infinite equal rectangles are contained in a circle yet none of these rectangles can be said to exist except in so far as the circle exists nor can the idea of any of these rectangles be said to exist except in so far as they are comprehended in the idea of the circle
4945941 problem in an aqueous globe to determine the places of intersection of any radiations parallel to an axis
4945942 if no account is taken of anything except the focal lenth of the eye or of the telescope
4945943 there is evidence that after 1666 spinozas ideas on theoretical optics were less sought after by his friends and acquaintences even jarigjelleswasquiteevidently dissatisfied with the way in which spinoza explained the apparent anomaly in descartes dioptrics
4945944 the rays coming from remote visible objects are considered parallel
4945945 i still have to warn you as to the faults of the eye
4945946 there will be no more refraction at the entrance of that eye
4945947 with concave and convex spherical lenses to make telescopes that are better than the one made according to what we know now and that emulate the perfection of those that are made withellipticor hyperbolic lenses

4945949 i dreamt of being chased by many wild animals in the desert i ran as fast as i could falling on the ground and getting up then an elephant came to my rescue with fresh green leaves in its mouth it stretched out to give me the leaves i just woke up before reaching for the leaves

4945955 this group of radical leftists paid by george soros with a mission to discredit conservatives this isnt the kind of group i think we should feel compelled to be answering all the time our side seems to think well i dont want to be criticized we dont wanna look bad the more media matters criticizes me the better i like it and the less i intend to read it we can talk about media matters about as long as i can tolerate it and im already close to my limit
4945956 who cares i dont care my comment on media matters is who cares
4945957 i think that media matters wouldnt know a serious flaw if it bit em in the behind i cant stand media matters i dont think media matters does anything of worth if you think theres a serious flaw what is it when you mention media matters i am thinking that i am wasting my time listening for the next two minutes if you want to talk to me about media matters im out

4945960 appearing on a show is not an endorsement of the host i do a 120 shows and do most of the shows that come to me if i had to agree with every talk show host id never go on any shows being on a show does not mean i endorse a hosts views i have even been on liberal shows and i sure dont endorse them
4945961 thatll make you a nut to those guys you better be careful about agreeing with me about anything
4945962 it certainly looks more than suspicious and now obama is trying to explain how all of this relates and what is the relationship i dont know if i was working with anybody first of all i cant imagine that i would ever want to be associated with someone like rezko let alone taking campaign contributions from him or um letting him be involved in buying a property with me im asking what i am saying is i am not definitively concluding anything im just saying that these questions arent being sufficiently asked in the chicago newspapers research they are reporting them im asking the same questions the chicago papers are asking which obama has not truly answered to answer them fully you might need the authority of a prosecutor you might need the authority of a criminal investigator you might even need the authority of a grand jury
4945963 im an investigative reporter saying okay heres the issue and im raising a question about these issues now im not a prosecutor i dont have subpoena power i dont have grand jury power i cant tell testimony but you know if i were in those positions i might well consider doing so but im not im an investigative reporter i just raise questions and i dont say anywhere in the book i dont say anything definitive about it more than this looks suspicious there are some things that are pretty definitive you know im positive that the frank in dreams of my father is frank marshall davis but even in his rebuttal it confirms that i dont think there is any question that frank is frank marshall davis weve established that now whether the loan was involved in the purchase of the obama dream property i cant say for sure one way or the other i just ask questions
4945964 why did it take obama so long to conclude that rezko was a shady character
4945965 for the lord gives wisdom and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding he holds victory in store for the upright he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones

4945973 im really struggling im going to denver to cast my vote only for hillary and no one else shes good shes kind shes compassionate
4945974 i dont know one single hispanic over 50 who will cast a vote for obama
4945975 that might push us all to go to the polls and vote
4945976 i think voters will look at john mccain very seriously if obama doesnt come back and give them a compelling reason to vote for him
4945977 everyone needs a personal touch everybody knows everybody here were personable here
4945978 when push comes to shove its not the world economy its not the war
4945979 for them its a new beginning thats why they call it the miracle but its the wrong beginning
4945980 these are communities of total chaos they buy a piece of land without any infrastructure any transportation its false hope
4945981 to me obama is not an american name its a name like in the middle east i dont know the man very well
4945982 i always fight for the little people because i am one of those little people
4945983 it says something to the world a black man being nominated for the presidency of the u s im interested in peace and caring for one another
4945984 it bothers me that hispanics are not for obama hispanics have gone through a lot of the same discrimination as black people have
4945985 i saw so much segregation and so much abuse of the black population if anything will make a change the president of this country will make a difference
4945986 obama has the power to change feelings toward ethnic groups as much as anyone has ever had that power
4945987 it is personal to me in our schools i started the bilingual programs
4945988 he has to project his interest in every ethnic group
4945989 there has to be a lot of groundwork they have sent some wonderful young people here but theyre all young anglo men they need to bring some hispanic men and women and some blacks along with the anglos

4946009 the mainstream media such as state owned rtm will immediately apportion the blame to us i say let us investigate and punish those perpetrators irrespective they are from pakatan rakyat or barisan nasional
4946010 my point is that the mainstream media is at fault for presenting a biased case not only that but malicious attack against pkr
4946011 berita harian said this samseng culture is now prevalent in pkr but when umno youth deputy chief khairy jamaluddin and gang threw bottles they were not at fault
4946012 this is the berita harian culture which must be corrected because it is slanderous and treacherous to defend corruption and cruelty

4946033 medvedev essentially invited the commissioner to present his case in russian court reminding the commissioner that the nhl success rate in the russian legal system is equal to the zero percent success rate of russian hockey interests in the us court system
4946034 the post has learned that medvedev citing common practice in international soccer offered to pay a transfer fee to the predators in order to resolve the dispute but that bettman refused to consider the proposal the nhl has forbidden its teams to pay transfer fees to european clubs
4946035 the post has learned that medvedev also informed bettman that the khl would hold a universal draft for the 2009 10 season that will include players currently under contract in the nhl medvedev told bettman khl clubs will offer signing bonuses of 1m to players who are playing in the nhl this season
4946036 extend the unilateral moratorium introduced on july 15 2008 on inviting players from nhl clubs to join the khl who are free agents and have no contract
4946037 we will observe a moratorium until the first case of disrespect for khl contracts and contract rights clubs khl by the nhl

4946046 i think its fabulous that they have scientifically god willing put this issue to rest although parents will not agree with it and those people who are proponents of measles as the cause of autism will find a problem with the paper
4946047 this study refutes the data wakefield presented 10 years ago
4946048 it gives them something to grasp onto that could be altered to prevent future cases of autism
4946049 the whole premise by wakefield that the measles component of the mmr vaccine caused a chronic intestinal inflammation that allowed harmful proteins to enter the bloodstream and ultimately the brain causing autism has not one shred of scientific evidence in its support

4946056 hoe erger het wordt hoe meer je zal ter hulp worden geroepen
4946057 vijf miljard voor jeugdbescherming maar slechts een half miljard voor jeugdwerk
4946058 die story is gebaseerd op n gegeven namelijk dat de rijkswacht meer pvs opstelt als men dus alle autos die slecht geparkeerd staan systematisch gaat verbaliseren dan gaat de criminaliteit nog stijgen
4946059 de specifieke jeugdcriminaliteit is niet merkbaar gestegen bijvoorbeeld ook de criminaliteit tegen personen niet amper 1 wel is er daarentegen een spectaculaire stijging van criminaliteit tegen goederen van vandalisme dus
4946060 men heeft nu eenmaal geopteerd voor een bepaalde maatschappij zo aanvaardt men bijvoorbeeld dat om de 56 minuten in ons land een kind wordt aangereden door een auto en dat op drie dagen twee kinderen op die manier om het leven komen ook de oplossing voor zon probleem is typisch men wil het kind van de straat weghouden men vergeet daarbij echter wel dat dit het natuurlijke leefmilieu is van een kind het is toch typisch dat voor de jeugdbescherming vijf miljard wordt uitgetrokken maar voor het preventieve jeugdwerk slechts vijfhonderd miljoen
4946061 ik ben in liverpool geweest een ontzettend arme stad er is veel werkloosheid de jongeren vervelen zich mede omdat er ook weinig andere culturele activiteiten zijn op eender welk gebied en daarom is voetbal daar werkelijk een religie geworden ze hebben niets anders
4946062 ik denk van wel iets heeft een tijd nodig om te rijpen het voetbalgeweld is niet nieuw al in het begin van de jaren zeventig duikt het op maar het is steeds erger geworden
4946063 ik ben niet in liverpool geweest maar ik heb toch de indruk dat het liverpool van nu niet dat van de jaren zestig was toen hadden wij de indruk dat het daar werkelijk een paradijs was ook economisch
4946064 ja maar dat was niet alleen economisch voor mij betekent dat nog altijd hoofdzakelijk de idee dat de jongeren iets konden doen zelfs zodanig dat hun entousiasme ook volwassenen aanstak denk aan de provobeweging bijvoorbeeld dat was zeker niet uitsluitend zelfs niet op de eerste plaats een jongerenbeweging en nu krijg je het omgekeerde dat uitzichtloze beeld dat jongeren nu hebben daar herkennen volwassenen zich in vergeet niet dat de meeste van die volwassenen ouders zijn en als die ook maar iets voelen voor hun kinderen dan weten die ook wel dat dat toekomstperspectief er allesbehalve rooskleurig uitziet en dan zie je dat volwassenen en jongeren zich tot een item verenigen in dit geval hooliganisme terwijl in de golden sixties de creativiteit een kans kreeg niet dat die er nu niet meer is maar het beleid staat daar haaks op welke generatie verschrijdende items zijn er nu kernenergie de milieuverwoesting daar kunnen jongeren en ouderen het allemaal over eens zijn en dan moet je eens zien hoe de overheid daar naar kijkt en hoe deze opvattingen van hoe onze maatschappij er morgen moet uitzien in de verdomhoek gedreven worden als men zich nog maar vragen stelt rond kernenergie is men al verdacht daar staat tegenover dat driekwart van onze nieuwsberichten de lezers kijkers of luisteraars met een vijandbeeld bombardeert dat gaat van de grote oost west verhoudingen tot details als het voetbal wij zijn de goeien de anderen de slechten de affaire voeren wordt in kranten van diverse strekkingen gebruikt om latent een vijandbeeld te cre eren politiekers worden opgevoed als vijanden daar moeten we tegen zijn en dan moet je eens de taal van de jongeren luisteren en dat hoeven daarom nog niets eens extreme hooligans te zijn die zijn voortdurend bezig met een vijandbeeld zij vertonen voortdurend een gedrag alsof ze in het verweer moeten gaan denk aan de school hoe moet men hen daar leren mee omgaan met dat valse vijandbeeld en dan wil ik het nog niet eens hebben over racisme en al die dingen
4946065 de politie kan geen dubbel gelaat hebben de ene dag met de helm op het hoofd en de wapenstok in de hand erop kloppen en de andere dag de vriendelijke wijkagent spelen dat kan niet meer dat heeft trouwens ook maar kort geduurd we hebben de dramas gezien in nottingham vorig jaar met de mijnwerkersstaking daar is het politie imago van de vriendelijke bobby niet gelijkgemaakt met de grond maar in de grond geboord en je denkt toch niet dat ze al dat materiaal die waterkanonnen die rookbommen dat ze die plotseling te voorschijn hebben getoverd nee die waren reeds lang aanwezig ze waren daarmee getraind en toch is dat naar buiten uit ook voor ons steeds het symbool geweest van de rustige flegmatieke agent dat gaat nu niet langer meer ofwel is men politieman ge ntegreerd in de maatschappij waarop iedereen een beroep kan doen noodzakelijk om bepaalde dingen in evenwicht te houden ofwel stelt de politie zich op als ordetroep
4946066 dat is ook zo bij de wetenschappelijke onderzoekers ook die durven vaak geen beschuldigende vinger uitsteken omdat dit hun eigen onderzoeksproject op de helling zet maar eigenlijk zou dit niet mogen al was het maar alleen maar omdat die onderzoeksresultaten niet als beschuldiging zijn bedoeld maar als waarschuwing in de zin van jongens stop ermee doe het anders of maar toch moeten we vaststellen dat onderzoeksploegen die dat aandurven geen centen meer krijgen en zo is dat ook op andere terreinen ik moet bijvoorbeeld de eerste parlementaire vraag nog zien over de leerplichtverlenging is daar ooit over de leerling gepraat over diegene waarvoor het eigenlijk moest dienen de parlementairen weten niet wat ze daar gestemd hebben bij wijze van spreken die verlenging moest er komen om externe redenen onder meer om de werkloosheidscijfers te drukken maar niemand heeft ook hier zijn vinger opgestoken beschuldigend of niet het jeugdmoratorium later wordt ontzettend verlengd onder meer door de schoolplicht maar door de werkloosheid gaat men er pas erg laat en in vele gevallen zelfs nooit bijhoren dit is werkelijk een tijdbom onder onze cultuur op de koop toe wordt ook de sociale zekerheid bij jongeren afgebroken zodanig dat ze langer afhankelijk blijven van hun ouders trouwens ook de arbeidsetos moet herzien worden hier is zeker een taak weggelegd voor de vakbonden die met hun huidige terminologie omtrent tewerkstelling bij de jeugd totaal niet meer aankomen jongeren zijn niet de rijkdom van morgen zoals men wel eens zegt ze zijn enkel wat ze nu zijn het is dan ook ons aller opdracht de jongeren terug in de maatschappij te brengen
4946067 het leren beheersen van de drang om te vernietigen is een essenti le voorwaarde voor het samenleven
4946068 vandalisme leeft van de anonimiteit de vandaal mijdt een confrontatie hij moet het hebben van de zekerheid dat zijn pakkans minimaal is vandar dat het aannemelijk is dat een persoonlijke confrontatie een zinvolle tegenzet is
4946069 swastikas en dergelijke hoe dan ook een zekere fascinatie uitoefenen
4946070 de blinde afkeer van de staat de politiek de democratie die een makkelijke voedingsbodem vormt voor blind geweld maar tegelijkertijd zijn het de themas die rechts via al haar kanalen dagelijks ontwikkelt en die een voedingsbodem geven aan nieuw rechts en uiterst rechts de aanwezigheid van neo fascisten onder de herrieschoppers valt dus in een verband te plaatsen
4946071 nu moeten wij die explosieve massa eens gaan afleiden want anders gaan die
4946072 ik denk niet dat het veel met voetbal te maken heeft ik denk dat het voortkomt uit vage politieke motieven uit pogingen om de maatschappij te ontwrichten
4946073 ik ben solidair ik ben hier voor het voetbal ik verlaat mijn kameraden niet
4946074 het is jammer dat een initiatief als de beiaardconcerten dat eigenlijk model stond voor zomerse gezelligheid en ontspanning nu voor velen een uitvlucht is om hier de boel op stelten te komen zetten er is een analogie met het voetbal waarbij de rellen ook niets met het spel te maken hebben
4946075 een sociale toestand die dergelijke wandaden in de hand werkt
4946076 het zou trouwens nog eens oorlog moeten worden voor al die jonge herrieschoppers zouden ze zich dan aan het front onder mekaar kunnen laten verminken of erger
4946077 nee eigenlijk niet echt al zie ik niet veel andere remedies tegen de kwaal
4946078 uit verschillende onderzoeken naar voetbalvandalisme en ook uit het experiment in antwerpen is gebleken dat het ideale team bestaat uit een mannelijke en een vrouwelijke fancoach dat zal ook in gent het geval zijn wanneer in augustus 91 het project definitief van start gaat dat de vrouw het eerst is benoemd is gewoon toeval maar toch is een vrouw daar op haar plaats omdat er binnen die sides een macho cultuur heerst die voor een stuk wordt doorbroken als een vrouw daaraan meewerkt lieve is maatschappelijk assistente maar eigenlijk is er geen specifieke vereiste om fancoach te worden het voornaamste is dat die mensen gemotiveerd zijn dat ze kunnen omgaan met de doelgroep en dat ze voldoen aan een hoop eigenschappen omdat ze toch wel een heleboel diverse taken op zich moeten nemen laten we er geen doekjes om winden als er vechtpartijen zijn wordt er alvast van de mannelijke fancoach verwacht dat hij er tussenkomt en dan zal hij onvermijdelijk ook af en toe klop krijgen natuurlijk op een vrouw gaan ze normaal gezien echter niet slaan buiten die fysieke aanwezigheid op het veld ook bij uitwedstrijden is er nog de home werking een soort van kantine waar ook bepaalde aktiviteiten kunnen plaatsvinden en een zekere hulpverlening waarmee ik bedoel dat die gasten weten dat ze op de fancoaches kunnen rekenen
4946079 als we op verplaatsing spelen doen ze dat in mijn geval ook maar als ik goed speel staan diezelfde mensen te applaudisseren ik denk dus dat ze dat niet doen uit racisme maar om je uit je koncentratie te halen
4946080 dat is onzin op school in het voetbal waar dan ook in onze maatschappij was er sprake van een toename van het geweld in het amateurvoetbal is er meer agressie dan in het profvoetbal is dat abnormaal nee toch rondom mij zie ik steeds meer gefrustreerde mensen op het werk in het verkeer overal de stress neemt toe er wordt meer ge ist van de mensen het leven wordt er niet vrolijker op
4946081 misschien moeten ze nog strenger worden aangepakt want profs worden goed betaald en hebben een voorbeeldfunctie we moeten durven toegeven dat we te tolerant zijn geweest en nog zijn het kan toch niet dat er na club brugge anderlecht een wedstrijd die door een stel hooligans is verpest niet n man is aangehouden het kan toch niet dat 500 heethoofden het plezier van 200 000 mensen om zeep helpen en niet wordt opgetreden
4946082 ik heb daar zeker geen studie van gemaakt en weet dus niet of daar een oorzaak kan worden gezocht maar zelfs ls dat er een invloed zou op hebben dan geeft je dat nog niet het recht om op iemands gezicht te gaan slaan of met dingen te beginnen gooien want dat schrikt andere supporters af zelfs bij de opening van het aparte clubhuis in het kader van het fan coaching project heb ik geweigerd daar naartoe te gaan ik vind dat die mensen harder moeten worden aangepakt die moeten niet in de watten worden gelegd dat ze eerst eens bewijzen dat ze fatsoenlijke supporters zijn die hun club waardig zijn dan zal ik de eerste zijn om met hen te gaan spreken alhoewel ik moet toegeven dat ik ook met de echte supportersclubs maar n keer per jaar contact heb door het feit dat ik te ver weg woon kan ik me niet permitteren van eens naar n vereniging te gaan en de andere in de kou te laten staan dat is nochtans gemakkelijk hoor om zowat rond te lopen maar ik vind dat dit ten koste gaat van het werk voor de club
4946083 met de houding van vandereycken zitten de jongeren echt in hun maag zij voelen zich chte supporters en zouden alles doen voor hun club maar zij krijgen niets terug bij het afsluiten van het seizoen hadden ze b v graag eens de spelers gezien maar dat kan dus niet h want zij zijn toch maar krapuul en uitschot ik moet zeggen dat raakt hen dus wel zij zeggen wij staan voor de club maar de club staat niet voor ons
4946084 kijk dat is een visie h door het feit dat het supportershome in het stadion is gelegen blijven ze ook na het voetbal daar rondhangen ondanks het feit dat de supporters zich voor een gedeelte schaamden voor hun club omdat ze op dit moment niet zo goed speelt ik kan me daar niet over uitspreken of dat inderdaad zo is hier in gent kan ik wel zeggen dat ook als de club slecht speelt er een zeer sterke groep is die desondanks blijft supporteren er zullen er inderdaad wel heel wat zijn die afhaken en voor een andere ploeg gaan supporteren maar dat zijn dan toch geen mensen die van jongsaf aan voor a a gent hebben gesupporterd

4946117 putting money in would do them no good because just keeping the facility open doesnt help the community if there are no doctors to see patients we need to get them doctors that is the priority
4946118 we dont have a firm contingency plan in place at this time but we have been receiving some calls of interest from physicians so we are keeping positive
4946119 it is crucial for this centre to stay open so we will continue to do everything we can especially since the community has given their heart and soul to this centre

4946173 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
4946174 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
4946175 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
4946176 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
4946177 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
4946178 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
4946179 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

4946207 they dont see as much difference between themselves and others
4946208 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
4946209 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
4946210 we need to do more to recognize integrity among our students and find ways to tap into the bravery honest and empathy that was found in the academic heroes in our study
4946211 has the potential to change the way people do archaeology
4946212 this approach really brings in the computer as a research partner to archaeologists
4946213 we mimic the archaeologists methods as much as possible so that they can really use our system as a tool
4946214 when fully developed this system could reduce the time needed to reconstruct a wall from years to months it could free up archaeologists for other valuable tasks such as restoration and ethnographic study
4946215 this showed that the system could work in a real life situation
4946216 we want to support the pcb particularly world cricket needs pakistan cricket to be strong so we need to support them but at the moment only on this point of time with a lot of happening in pakistan we have a lot of concerns
4946217 ultimately its the iccs and the boards decision to make what they want to do well have to wait and see what reports does the task force give back to the icc next week
4946218 another key difference this time is that there will be eight teams on the ground its a lot lot harder to strengthen out security measures with so many teams going to different practice venues ground areas that is principally a concern of ours and we would want to see that demonstrated that is a major difference for sure for us
4946219 although we havent been there as for 12 years we know that cricket is a sport and we shouldnt be subjecting the players to risk we cant go anywhere if the security advice says its not safe and at the moment we are not quite ready to make a decision we would certainly be making a recommendation to our board of directors sometimes next week
4946220 dave richardson and his security advisors talked about the commitments made by the pcb to protect the aussies and other cricketing teams during ct
4946221 we have the icc our own security company and we have access to other security advice and intelligence what well be doing is that we will be adding the iccs advice to that store of information and make a recommendation to our board of directors i will expect that will happen sometimes later this week

4946252 i was able to theoretically confirm that planned design changes to the current bifilar fault current limiter being developed by siemens and american superconductor would decrease ac losses in the system my calculations are good news for the future of the device
4946253 i modelled the bifilar design as an infinite stack of superconducting tapes in which adjacent tapes carry current in opposite directions i was able to find an exact solution for the magnetic fields and currents that are generated in such a stack of tapes once i calculated how the magnetic flux penetrates into the tape i then could calculate how much energy is lost in each current cycle for different tape widths and spacings between adjacent tapes

4946304 action has risen to a different level today it is mostly special effects we used to perform our stunts on our own and today the actors use all kinds of props there lies a difference between men and boys now
4946305 after watching the show i think guys should stop talking about action and start getting inspired from women

4946322 yes sajid nadiadwala is the one who thought of the script and role and since i know a lot of people in hollywood he approached me it wasnt an easy task even though there is a lot of awareness of our films here no one wanted to test the waters it took a fair amount of persistence and knowledge of the industry here but i was able to ultimately deliver since sajid sly and denise are all my friends it was great to bring them together for this project
4946323 theres no one in town all my friends from the industry are not here in fact i had spoken to shah rukh khan he had promised to fly back to mumbai for my birthday very sweet of him
4946324 my mom and dad are not flying over from delhi my birthday is not such a big deal for me id just be happy to spend it with kareena kapoor and my kids
4946325 rakha bandhan is always special for me as my two sisters celebrate it in a big way every year and this year it is even more special because it also coincides with my birthday
4946326 on earlier occasions of raksha bandhan i have always presented them with gifts but this time i am expecting a gift from them
4946327 its been an eventful and fulfilling year i found love in kareena professionally it was a quiet year there was race but then there were two films that didnt do well i need to focus more on my work i want to put together some good projects and work hard since my personal life is so stable ive no excuse to not give my job my best shot
4946328 im actually a creative producer my partner dinesh vijen takes care of the nitty gritties im there as an actor for my first production i let my director imtiaz ali do exactly what he wants
4946329 ive discovered there are many things i like about myself and a couple of things that i dont like about myself im 38 now do i feel wise sometimes i do at other times im still as impulsive and headstrong as i used to be
4946330 i felt when i grew older id outgrow certain bands when it came to music that id stop enjoying rock when i was older that didnt happen i still enjoy some of the things that i did 10 years ago is that bad
4946331 i think if youre health conscious and youre physically fit and look after yourself 38 is a great age to be today im more aware of myself i know who i am with and what im comfortable with ive quit smoking completely this the healthiest time of my life
4946332 what nonsense i dont even know what a panic attack is does it mean i thought i had a heart attack no such thing happened to me
4946333 london has become bollywoods favourite second home mine too a lot of us actors love london i spent a lot of my growing years in london but i dont feel too much at home there mumbai is where i feel home is
4946334 sadly im going off to dubai to do a show then im going to the us for an event i also have to shoot in kolkata delhi and rajasthan to complete imtiaz alis film theres quite a lot of the film that remains so im hardly in mumbai itd be nice to spend some time in mumbai not working just spending some time with the kids
4946335 but im quite open to her working with other leading men i think shes doing imtiaz alis next film with another actor just as im doing imtiazs current film with deepika padukone so what even if we work separately we still manage to spend quite a lot of time together

4946356 its hard for the springboks now to win the tournament hence their likely response
4946357 they are the world champions and theres no way they will be excited about contemplating another loss
4946358 weve had a bit of that scenario but having said that its an opportunity for us and weve got to make the most of it
4946359 without a doubt the springboks wont want to suffer again at home and they are playing at one of their favourite destinations

4946363 these are dirty tactics it is a malicious campaign on their part and is completely immoral
4946364 i am telling you there is no case they cannot proceed the medical report is so clear in the event the judicial system is fair whichever judge hears the case will throw it out
4946365 you can see the dirty tricks beginning in their campaign it is corrupt and immoral to use religion and the koran
4946366 dont insult the religion of islam by playing political games
4946367 they will probably try to convince voters that islam is under threat and that malay rights are under threat
4946368 it is not called the mother of by elections for nothing it is an indication of national politics and of our track record so far it is a barometer of politics in malaysia at large
4946369 if anwar succeeds in pulling in a large number of malay votes it will boost the oppositions standing and the road to forming the next government will be clearer
4946370 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
4946371 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
4946372 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
4946373 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
4946374 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
4946375 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
4946376 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in order to get something else through
4946377 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit and issues have to be taken on their merits
4946378 i cant in good conscience support a law that i just dont agree with
4946379 i was petrified i started sweating heavily and shaking my mind was racing and i could hear a loud thumping noise like someone banging a big drum i couldnt work it out then i realised it was my heart
4946380 exhausted emotionally vulnerable isolated and far from home i was ready for the taking
4946381 for a moment i was convinced i was dying i knew i was in serious trouble i had to get help
4946382 out of the blue in front of ellie and hayley i felt a massive surge of anxiety overwhelm me like a huge wave it sucked the breath clean out of my lungs the next 48 hours were hell
4946383 i started thinking seriously about doing myself harm i knew i didnt want to carry on living like this
4946384 it was though someone flicked a switch i knew it was over the tears welled up as i started to walk back to the pavilion
4946385 i knew i no longer had any say in the matter the illness had come back the thought of what i was doing hit me like a kick in the guts i would probably never again experience the great highs hard work and joy of playing for england
4946386 as for those who disbelieve their patrons are false deities they will abide in the fire
4946387 let our differences not cause hatred and strife between us let us respect each other be fair just and kind to one another and live in sincere peace harmony and mutual goodwill
4946388 they do blasphemy who say god is christ the son of mary they do blaspheme who say god is one of three in a trinity verily a grievous penalty will befall the blasphemers among them christ the son of mary was no more than a messenger
4946389 and the jews say ezra is the son of allah and christians say messiah is the son of allah allahs curse be on them how they are deluded away from the truth
4946390 on the day of resurrection isa jesus himself will be a witness against jews amp christians for believing in his death
4946391 allahs apostle said how will you be when the son of mary jesus descends among you and will judge people by the law of the quran and not by the law of the gospel
4946392 by him in whose hands my soul is surely isa the son of mary will soon descend amongst you and will judge mankind justly he will break the cross and kill the pigs and there will be no jizya
4946393 take not the jews or christians for your friends or protectors they are but friends and protectors to each other he among you who turns to them for friendship is of them
4946394 let believers not take disbelievers for friends guard yourself against them taking security
4946395 jews will not be pleased with you nor the christians until you follow their religion
4946396 but as for those who disbelieve garments of fire will be cut out for them boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads 22 19
4946397 fight the disbelievers who are near to you and let them find harshness in you
4946398 i will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve smite the necks and smite of them each finger
4946399 if anyone of you desires a religion other than islam it will never be accepted of him
4946400 fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued
4946401 a rose by any other name would smell as sweet
4946402 holy war as it is known in islamic jurisprudence is basically an offensive war this is the duty of muslims in every age when the needed military power becomes available to them thus the apostle of god said i was commanded to fight the people until they believe in god and his message
4946403 the verse 9 5 does not leave any room in the mind to conjecture about what is called defensive war this verse asserts that holy war which is demanded in islamic law is not defensive war because it could legitimately be called an offensive war this is the apex and most honorable of all holy wars
4946404 defensive warfare in islam is nothing but a phase of the islamic mission which the prophet practiced after that it was followed by another phase that is calling all people to embrace islam so that nothing less would be acceptable from atheists and those who associate other deities with god also nothing would be acceptable from the people of the book except conversion to islam or being subjugated to muslim rule in addition there is the command to fight anyone who attempts to stand in its way until the day of resurrection
4946405 islam has approved war so that the word of god becomes supreme this is war for the cause of god holy war
4946406 call them to accept islam before you fight with them if they refuse fight them
4946407 fight against those who disbelieve in allah invite them to accept islam if they refuse to accept islam demand for them the jizya if they refuse to pay the tax seek allahs help and fight them
4946408 summon the people to god those who refuse must pay the poll tax out of humiliation amp lowliness if they refuse this it is the sword without leniency
4946409 when abu sufyan of mecca is brought to muhammad he is told to confess
4946410 woe to you accept islam and testify that muhammad is the apostle of god before your neck is cut off by the sword
4946411 what is required of an infidel or one who confuses other gods with god is to have his tongue surrender to the religion of god and subdue himself to the prophethood of muhammad but his heartfelt faith is not required at the beginning it will come later
4946412 with willing submission in defeat and subservience and feel themselves subdued disgraced humiliated and belittled
4946413 this is the basis for accepting jizya from the people of the book a state of abasement
4946414 when we say innocent people we mean muslims as far as non muslims are concerned they have not accepted islam as far as we are concerned that is a crime against god
4946415 christ himself used violence against the money changers in the temple
4946416 and christ said i did not come to bring peace but a sword
4946417 he it is who has sent his messenger with the guidance of the religion of truth that he may cause it to prevail over all religion however much the idolaters may be averse
4946418 when the prophet migrated from mecca to medina god ordered him to only fight those who fought him only then when the chapter of repentance surah 9 was revealed god commanded his prophet to fight anyone who did not become a muslim whether they fought him or not
4946419 war against non muslims the caliph makes war upon jews christians amp zoroastrians until they become muslims or else pay the non muslim poll tax the caliph fights all other peoples until they become muslim
4946420 jihad is etymologically derived from the word mujahada signifying warfare to establish the religion the duty of jihad exists as long as the universal domination of islam has not been attained until the end of the world
4946421 so at first the fighting was prohibited then it was permitted and after that it was made obligatory allah revealed in surah 9 the order to discard all obligations treaties and commanded the muslims to fight against all the pagans well as the people of the book if they do not embrace islam till they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued
4946422 the foreign policy of the islamic state must be to carry the islamic mission to the world by way of holy war this process has been established through the course of the ages this process has never been changed at all the apostle muhammad from the time he founded the state in the city of yahtrib prepared an army and began holy war to remove the physical barriers which hinder the spread of islam
4946423 by holy war kingdoms and states were removed and islam ruled the nations amp peoples
4946424 if we besiege the infidels we would call them to embrace islam first if they reject islam they have to pay the poll tax if they pay it they spare their blood and properties but if they refuse to pay the poll tax then fighting them becomes lawful these words and principles are confirmed by all the muslim scholars the apostle of god had designed the plan of conquest before his death then after him his successors undertook the responsibility of implementing this plan when they started conquering the countries peoples resistance or rejection does not matter because the islamic system is for all people in all countries
4946425 muslims have always believed who so slays a soul not to retaliate for a soul slain nor for corruption done in the land it should be as if he had slain mankind altogether
4946426 unless it be for manslaughter or for mischief in the land
4946427 waging war against allah and his prophet means hostility against his chosen representatives or deviation from his laws by overstepping the boundaries laid down by him or attempts to undermine the cause of islam and the overall interests of the muslims
4946428 the punishment of those who wage war against allah amp his apostle amp strive to make mischief fasadan in the land is only this they should be murdered or crucified or their hands amp feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned
4946429 fight them until there is no more fitnah disbelief persecution and religion will be for allah alone in the whole world
4946430 by him in whose hands my soul is son of mary jesus will shortly descend amongst you people muslims as a just ruler and will break the cross and kill the pig and abolish the jizya a tax taken from the non muslims who are in the protection of the muslim government
4946431 the hour will not be established until the son of mary i e jesus descends amongst you as a just ruler he will break the cross kill the pigs and abolish the jizya tax money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it as charitable gifts
4946432 our religion teaches tolerance we are told to present the message of islam and if they dont accept than so be it
4946433 we asked some moderate arabs if it was the case that only a tiny minority of palestinians celebrated nonsense said one speaking for many ninety percent of the arab world believes that americans got what they deserved
4946434 pa is trying to suppress broadcast images and photos of palestinians glorifying the terrorist attacks on the united states and hailing their suspected mastermind osama bin laden
4946435 he hit me and he cried he ran to court first and sued me
4946436 you must not kill other muslims brother and must not fight against the house of saud
4946437 there are only three choices in islam either willing submission or payment of the jizya thereby physical though not spiritual submission to the authority of islam or the sword for it is not right to let him live an infidel the matter is summed up for every person alive either submit or live under the suzerainty of islam or die
4946438 muslims and especially the learned among them should spread sharia law to the world that and nothing else muhammad
4946439 offensive jihad is an established and basic tenet of this religion
4946440 sent in the final hours with the sword so that none is worshipped but allah alone partnerless
4946441 we are told to present the message of islam and if they dont accept then so be it
4946442 god will deal with them but we must live with them as friends and love them this is what the religion teaches
4946443 islam has approved war so that the word of god becomes supreme this is war for the cause of god holy war
4946444 call them to accept islam before you fight with them if they refuse fight them
4946445 the foreign policy of the islamic state must be to carry the islamic mission to the world by way of holy war this process has been established through the course of the ages this process has never been changed at all the apostle muhammad from the time he founded the state in the city of yathrib prepared an army and began holy war to remove the physical barriers which hinder the spread of islam by holy war kingdoms and states were removed and islam ruled the nations amp peoples the glorious quran has revealed to muslims the reasons for fighting to carry the message of islam to the entire world
4946446 take not the jews or christians for your friends or protectors they are but friends and protectors to each other he among you who turns to them for friendship is of them
4946447 but as for those who disbelieve garments of fire will be cut out for them boiling fluid will be poured down on their heads 22 19
4946448 fight the disbelievers who are near to you and let them find harshness in you
4946449 i will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve smite the necks and smite of them each finger
4946450 if anyone of you desires a religion other than islam it will never be accepted of him
4946451 fight those who believe not in allah nor the last day nor hold that forbidden which has been forbidden by allah and his messenger nor acknowledge the religion of truth even if they are of the people of the book until they pay the jizya with willing submission and feel themselves subdued
4946452 waging war against allah and his prophet means hostility against his chosen representatives or deviation from his laws by overstepping the boundaries laid down by him or attempts to undermine the cause of islam and the overall interests of the muslims
4946453 the punishment of those who wage war against allah amp his apostle amp strive to make mischief fasadan in the land is only this they should be murdered or crucified or their hands amp feet should be cut off on opposite sides or they should be imprisoned
4946454 fight them until there is no more fitnah disbelief persecution and religion will be for allah alone in the whole world
4946455 fight them until there is no more fitnah trial in religion amp the religion will be for allah alone so that there is no more kufr disbelief
4946456 the duty of jihad exists as long as the universal domination of islam has not been attained until the end of the world peace with non muslim nations is therefore a provisional state of affairs only
4946457 who can eat breakfast in london lunch in paris and dinner in rome in one day but he threw all of this away in the struggle he believes in
4946458 no matter what he does there is something you have to recognize and respect
4946459 governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed
4946460 if the people or the cause they believe in dont appeal to you then no problem
4946461 her zeal zest and quest for knowledge helped her to encourage children to stay in school and to seek higher educational opportunities
4946462 and our mom is coming back from london tomorrow did you know
4946463 you know you should help out your dear brother more he is going to be tired tonight when he gets home and then he has to leave straight again maybe you should do
4946464 you know soph theres really something to you watching you almost fall flat on your face in front of us you have a cute personality nice to see someone who is daring and clumsy
4946465 he kept looking at you everytime i looked over there he was staring at you soph it was really really distracting
4946466 baby i love you but you look like warmed over death
4946467 women are like tea bags they dont know how strong they are until they get into hot water

4946471 all the generic ballot questions in the polls show voters want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want obama
4946472 he hasnt closed the sale every historical fact says he should be farther ahead than he is
4946473 obama lost the summer and part of it was he got arrogant and overreached he started talking about transition planning and going to all these red states like montana where he has no chance
4946474 a lot of americans were left scratching their heads thinking why isnt he talking to me
4946475 if he wants to win mccain has no choice but to go negative on obama
4946476 the fight is for the independents about 20 percent of the electorate
4946477 for mccain its the ties to bush and the desire for change and its obamas age inexperience and race theres enough to give people pause with each of them
4946478 john mccain has supporters but barack obama has believers and i think that makes a difference
4946479 i wouldnt necessarily call new jersey in play but at the same time were not going to take any votes for granted
4946480 shes been in political campaigns on every single level shes been on the national scene with the carpenters so its not foreign to her what she has to do here
4946481 if they truly believe that new jersey was not in play if they truly believe that this was a gimme they would not have put tricia mueller in charge
4946482 i think new jersey voters expect candidates to come ask for their votes
4946483 democrats at the end of the day will all be there
4946484 they might not be rushing toward the finish line but theyll be there
4946485 hasnt been there this voting bloc just needs to be educated
4946486 it will be the philosophy of our team here in new jersey to run like were 14 points behind
4946487 i think thats the way you need to approach any campaign
4946488 le dije que se era el camino que no hiciera estupideces
4946489 its very interesting when you suddenly feel like you might see hope and its on your own accord i will never forget that feeling in 8th grade of the world spinning around me a feeling very few girls my age are privlaged to feel and remember i would assume now that those days have long passed my goal is to find them again this time though it going to be my fault
4946490 you think of him and hope terribly that he thinks of you too but youtell yourself that he is and he does and with you float through sparkling waters soar through cloud streaked skies and wish you are in love
4946491 maybe i shoudl be able to get to this state on my own but i havent figured it out yet and until then i am forever greatful for his attention
4946492 do you want to come with sam and i to go swimming
4946493 we really wish theyd recognize whats happened in other states
4946494 is really not going to cut into the lcbs profitability or revenue
4946495 the question you as legislators must ask yourself is whether it is a wise policy to create or perpetuate an unregulated unaccountable non face to face channel of access for our kids
4946496 we do not believe the direct ship program has had a negative impact on revenues
4946497 both a regulatory challenge and concern however we have not found these two issues to be of significant negative consequence
4946498 not done the research on what other states are doing
4946499 it is a state we will be looking at but it is only about the size of allegheny county so theyre operating on a much smaller scale
4946500 dogs who live in this type of kennel are valued only for the sale price of their offspring
4946501 would shoot the dogs rather than pay for vet care
4946502 the warden said to them that if they would like to surrender dogs we would make arrangements with the animal rescue league to surrender those dogs
4946503 there are all kinds of ways to euthanize an animal a bullet to the head is instantaneous
4946504 she was destined to spend her life in a small cage and give birth to litter after litter until she was 8 or 9 and be discarded or shot like the dogs in berks county
4946505 to think nothing could happen to the people who did that is a disgrace

4946521 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4946522 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4946523 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4946524 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4946525 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap

4946566 remember the last time jim september 2005 it was that 65 miler going up to san clemente and back you were close to breaking below 200 lbs making plans for a big year in 2006 its a good thing you didnt have a crystal ball hard to believe its been so long but here you are yet again back on your bike cruising along the coast it took a while to recover from the setbacks of the last couple of years but aint it great to be back in carlsbad you betcha
4946567 nope were not done yet keep on pedaling buddy youve still got a few miles left in those legs

4946569 the political party known as the new alliance for progress nap has been accorded the right to operate on central african territory
4946570 it the project aims to create a stable security environment for free and transparent elections by reintroducing ex fighters socially and economically back into their old communities
4946571 i am not a scientist but this seems a reasonable concern
4946572 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4946573 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4946574 shall be commander in chief of the defence forces of zimbabwe
4946575 this whole process is about sharing power mr mugabe will be head of state and mr tsvangirai will be head of government with executive power
4946576 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
4946577 they police are claiming that by examining the victims he acted as a private doctor
4946578 the report that we released was a report by the government of kenya and is protected by law
4946579 i know some people turn their nose down a bit at the prospect that people could save 10 or so on a tank of petrol but we dont
4946580 we think its a very important part of having a more competitive petrol market and we intend to fight for it in the senate
4946581 well we do so we are going to get up there and fight for this measure
4946582 its an important measure and we think its important because it can help people save a small amount of money admittedly from time to time
4946583 but thats important to a lot of people who are under financial pressure
4946584 i was part of that inquiry process and it became quite clear that if you want to tackle the whole issue of fuel prices effectively the best way to do that is to tackle the issue of competition amongst the big four oil companies
4946585 what horse trading implies is that youll support something you dont believe in order to get something else through
4946586 the problem with horse trading is sometimes youll end up with a donkey or even worse a trojan horse so i need to decide things on their merit
4946587 its hard for the springboks now to win the tournament hence their likely response
4946588 they are the world champions and theres no way they will be excited about contemplating another loss
4946589 weve had a bit of that scenario but having said that its an opportunity for us and weve got to make the most of it
4946590 without a doubt the springboks wont want to suffer again at home and they are playing at one of their favourite destinations
4946591 its a good rugby venue and its something that we will be looking forward to
4946592 being there in the arena it was very evident that any side that enters a tri nations fixture that is not up for it is going to get belted
4946593 it possibly breaks the journey it possibly makes it a little bit easier
4946594 these are dirty tactics it is a malicious campaign on their part and is completely immoral
4946595 i am telling you there is no case they cannot proceed the medical report is so clear in the event the judicial system is fair whichever judge hears the case will throw it out
4946596 you can see the dirty tricks beginning in their campaign it is corrupt and immoral to use religion and the koran
4946597 dont insult the religion of islam by playing political games
4946598 they will probably try to convince voters that islam is under threat and that malay rights are under threat
4946599 it is not called the mother of by elections for nothing it is an indication of national politics and of our track record so far it is a barometer of politics in malaysia at large
4946600 if anwar succeeds in pulling in a large number of malay votes it will boost the oppositions standing and the road to forming the next government will be clearer
4946601 yes sajid nadiadwala is the one who thought of the script and role and since i know a lot of people in hollywood he approached me it wasnt an easy task even though there is a lot of awareness of our films here no one wanted to test the waters it took a fair amount of persistence and knowledge of the industry here but i was able to ultimately deliver since sajid sly and denise are all my friends it was great to bring them together for this project
4946602 the truth is that since the last year or so i havent got good film offers at all trash was coming to me in the name of scripts i am not insecure that i would go for any role im in a position now that i dont need to compromise
4946603 i took a sabbatical for a year and a half and that is when people in the industry realised my worth i have some good films now both as an actor and a producer and i am very happy
4946604 popcorn motion pictures is my obsession i started my career as a businessman with a restaurant and garment business but suniel shetty the businessman can take over only movies and not any other venture
4946605 action has risen to a different level today it is mostly special effects we used to perform our stunts on our own and today the actors use all kinds of props there lies a difference between men and boys now
4946606 after watching the show i think guys should stop talking about action and start getting inspired from women
4946607 ive learnt a lot today i understand my character i have tried my hand at everything from action romance to comedy im the only actor to have worked with over 90 directors and different roles
4946608 money comes last and self respect comes first for me i want to have goodwill in the industry im only looking forward to people appreciating my work in the future
4946609 no words can express my feelings today all i can say is that i will keep my rakhi promise and do whatever i can for these little ones and smitaji i cherish this rakhi very much
4946610 i make it a point to spend my free time with the children but today i felt they should enjoy festivities as well and i am happy a veteran like bappida and shweta pandit gave some of their valuable time for this cause
4946611 he behaved like god and tried to control everything in my life
4946612 apart from manipulating the media dale constantly told me what i should do and avoid which paper i should speak to and which paper i shouldnt i even heeded to an extent but then he began behaving as if he was all powerful as if he ruled me but hes just a pr not a god
4946613 i think ive earned my holiday i was so nervous and tense before the release that i couldnt sleep
4946614 every time a release is around the corner i put the desktop globe in front of my wife and tell her to pick a destination for a holiday i told my wife that if my new film was a hit ill take her to monte carlo if it doesnt work well have to do with mahabaleshwar
4946615 aarav never stays up beyond 10 30 p m but he watched singh is kinng till he could almost till the end then the poor fellow couldnt stay awake he fell asleep in my lap doesnt matter hell have lots of occasions to catch up with the film later
4946616 i know about amitji singing the singh is kinng song it happened after the toronto concert where i was on stage with the bachchans
4946617 really thats what makes him the real king of bollywood all of us who came into the industry after amitji have a lot to learn from him
4946618 akshay is far too generous and kind his current status is a remarkable lesson in hard work and self improvement to have done it under the extremely extenuating circumstances that he has faced is even more creditable
4946619 yes when im jamming with the band on stage during our concerts one of the items i sing is singh is kinng its great fun
4946620 theres no one in town all my friends from the industry are not here in fact i had spoken to shah rukh khan he had promised to fly back to mumbai for my birthday very sweet of him
4946621 my mom and dad are not flying over from delhi my birthday is not such a big deal for me id just be happy to spend it with kareena kapoor and my kids
4946622 rakha bandhan is always special for me as my two sisters celebrate it in a big way every year and this year it is even more special because it also coincides with my birthday
4946623 on earlier occasions of raksha bandhan i have always presented them with gifts but this time i am expecting a gift from them
4946624 its been an eventful and fulfilling year i found love in kareena professionally it was a quiet year there was race but then there were two films that didnt do well i need to focus more on my work i want to put together some good projects and work hard since my personal life is so stable ive no excuse to not give my job my best shot
4946625 im actually a creative producer my partner dinesh vijen takes care of the nitty gritties im there as an actor for my first production i let my director imtiaz ali do exactly what he wants
4946626 ive discovered there are many things i like about myself and a couple of things that i dont like about myself im 38 now do i feel wise sometimes i do at other times im still as impulsive and headstrong as i used to be
4946627 i felt when i grew older id outgrow certain bands when it came to music that id stop enjoying rock when i was older that didnt happen i still enjoy some of the things that i did 10 years ago is that bad
4946628 i think if youre health conscious and youre physically fit and look after yourself 38 is a great age to be today im more aware of myself i know who i am with and what im comfortable with ive quit smoking completely this the healthiest time of my life
4946629 what nonsense i dont even know what a panic attack is does it mean i thought i had a heart attack no such thing happened to me
4946630 london has become bollywoods favourite second home mine too a lot of us actors love london i spent a lot of my growing years in london but i dont feel too much at home there mumbai is where i feel home is
4946631 sadly im going off to dubai to do a show then im going to the us for an event i also have to shoot in kolkata delhi and rajasthan to complete imtiaz alis film theres quite a lot of the film that remains so im hardly in mumbai itd be nice to spend some time in mumbai not working just spending some time with the kids
4946632 but im quite open to her working with other leading men i think shes doing imtiaz alis next film with another actor just as im doing imtiazs current film with deepika padukone so what even if we work separately we still manage to spend quite a lot of time together
4946633 we regret to inform you that on this occasion you have been unsuccessful
4946634 hmm should i be annoyed because he cheated on me but no we werent really together so i should be annoyed because hes my friend and he shouldve told me
4946635 i find television very educational every time someone switches it on i go into another room and read a good book
4946636 we really wish theyd recognize whats happened in other states
4946637 is really not going to cut into the lcbs profitability or revenue
4946638 the question you as legislators must ask yourself is whether it is a wise policy to create or perpetuate an unregulated unaccountable non face to face channel of access for our kids
4946639 we do not believe the direct ship program has had a negative impact on revenues
4946640 both a regulatory challenge and concern however we have not found these two issues to be of significant negative consequence
4946641 not done the research on what other states are doing
4946642 it is a state we will be looking at but it is only about the size of allegheny county so theyre operating on a much smaller scale
4946643 pretty radical but we think it makes the most sense
4946644 theyre proposing some pretty innovative and in some cases difficult things to do
4946645 its too early for me to predict how this is going to be received
4946646 anything is possible if you have enough money to do it
4946647 we just cant tweak our way out of this flooding
4946648 we were shocked by the volumes of water coming out of this watershed
4946649 and the success or failure of such an effort really depends upon whether you can get all the stakeholders to agree if there is not a consensus on how to proceed something like this could be held up at many stages
4946650 the first thing they say when they visit is can we go downstairs
4946651 something you dont have yet and you figure youd like to add it to your collection
4946652 it fits my fancy if its beat up really old and rusted i need to have that
4946653 this was really bad once and he took it all apart and painted the back it was hard for him to do
4946654 when we were dating i used to stop by the candy store and they had gum ball machines with little trinkets and i would bring them to her and she saved them all
4946655 ill call the deputy mayor for public health next summer ill put you right in the morgue
4946656 that would pay for your housing and meals and you wouldnt have so much debt
4946657 then go to your schools foundations division on their web site theres often scholarship money that doesnt get distributed because students dont want to take the time to write the essays or do the paperwork
4946658 the advertising campaign concept was based on the fact that the actor has roots
4946659 if there is anything i am lacking in it is taste in music and art and other great things in life
4946660 im pleased we were able to keep the produce center not just in terms of jobs but because we are a food capital of america
4946661 john mccain has supporters but barack obama has believers and i think that makes a difference
4946662 i wouldnt necessarily call new jersey in play but at the same time were not going to take any votes for granted
4946663 shes been in political campaigns on every single level shes been on the national scene with the carpenters so its not foreign to her what she has to do here
4946664 if they truly believe that new jersey was not in play if they truly believe that this was a gimme they would not have put tricia mueller in charge
4946665 i think new jersey voters expect candidates to come ask for their votes
4946666 democrats at the end of the day will all be there
4946667 they might not be rushing toward the finish line but theyll be there
4946668 hasnt been there this voting bloc just needs to be educated
4946669 it will be the philosophy of our team here in new jersey to run like were 14 points behind
4946670 i think thats the way you need to approach any campaign
4946671 dogs who live in this type of kennel are valued only for the sale price of their offspring
4946672 would shoot the dogs rather than pay for vet care
4946673 the warden said to them that if they would like to surrender dogs we would make arrangements with the animal rescue league to surrender those dogs
4946674 there are all kinds of ways to euthanize an animal a bullet to the head is instantaneous
4946675 she was destined to spend her life in a small cage and give birth to litter after litter until she was 8 or 9 and be discarded or shot like the dogs in berks county
4946676 to think nothing could happen to the people who did that is a disgrace
4946677 you just cant let it get to you there are other things way more important
4946678 im waiting for some really good thing to happen from this because everything happens for a reason
4946679 i didnt feel my finger shaking but i guess it was
4946680 i realized it went off and i hope it made it to the black i call it a freak of nature
4946681 what happened today i think will keep him going keep him determined and he will be more experienced
4946682 if you cant deal with this now how are you going to deal with me going to the uk
4946683 lets be friends but i really dont want to see you with any other guy
4946684 theyre similar enough for us to say to a neighborhood to be aware
4946685 at first glance he doesnt look like the other perpetrator
4946686 before we just had to worry about gunshots in the day now we have to worry about going to sleep
4946687 i feel like getting some kind of protection for myself from now on
4946688 originally we set aside 200 million of our own funds but we see this attracting another 2 billion from our other firms
4946689 the main reason i have come across is that people are either older and want to protect their own assets or they have been through a separation before and they want to make sure they are protected
4946690 das war nur ein erster datensatz tats chlich habe ich die adressen und bankdaten von 1 5 millionen kunden gesichert
4946691 our choice is not whether we grow but how well we will grow
4946692 it was pretty heartbreaking yesterday this makes me feel pretty good
4946693 he just told me to take her to the front and keep her there and i just did what he told me to
4946694 she just did everything perfectly and that kind of made me feel a little bit better today
4946695 im just glad he gave me a chance to ride his horse i was really excited
4946696 it was a little hard to come to the barn this morning
4946697 but i was there at five oclock we get over it because we know it can happen
4946698 thats the second time a horse has gone down there
4946699 we didnt even take our horse ambulance out on the track in great falls well have some come back to the stalls a little lame once in a while but as a whole this year were doing fantastic
4946700 we didnt hurt any horses in miles city and didnt hurt any in great falls
4946701 there were no fractures in her legs at all and nothing to indicate what happened
4946702 it could just be something weird where she went to change leads and took a bad step
4946703 horse racing is the most regulated sport thats out there including all of your major sports
4946704 for older people its to allow them to reflect on the past and for kids its to see their heritage
4946705 years ago in the 1920s and 30s a lot of farmers couldnt afford the equipment to harvest wheat
4946706 one farmer would own the equipment and all the neighbors would get together and do one farm at a time
4946707 if you baked this into bread it would probably look like cracked wheat bread
4946708 i do some of this for fun and i make some of the tools i need for my saddle business
4946709 sometimes its easier to make the stuff than find it
4946710 i never imagined that some of this stuff still works
4946711 this is the only part of the park where we have any frontier development
4946712 adds a great bit of information to the park history
4946713 sardines must have been a big part of their diet
4946714 before these guys came we had no money to do this
4946715 a good spot to camp 2 000 years ago was still a good spot to camp for the pioneers
4946716 this is the kind of thing that follows you your whole career
4946717 this is truly a great air force day but also a bittersweet day
4946718 its a day when squad members say goodbye to colleagues who will scatter around the country but also a day to be proud and reflect on what theyve accomplished
4946719 were going to make a little money to salt next years fair
4946720 we know that for some families were their last celebration of summer whether or not they get a vacation
4946721 for the past three years weve made a very concerted effort to build the amount of entertainment on the grounds so that people felt they got value for the price they paid to come into the gate
4946722 there is enough to do that we dont think you can see it all in a day and thats the strategy
4946723 weve had many repeat visitors we have some each year but we think that is a very solid fact this year
4946724 it feels tremendous to be able to work that hard and have some smiling faces and something left to show for it
4946725 there are years when that has not been the case
4946726 four years ago when i chose john a republican to be my lieutenant governor i took some heat from a few democrats
4946727 and i know some republicans who werent very happy either
4946728 but working across party lines was more important to us weve created the largest budget surplus and the most tax relief in state history weve helped create over 50 000 new jobs and our economy is one of the fastest growing in the country did i leave anything out
4946729 weve restricted visiting to all patients although there are exceptions if youve got a very seriously ill patient
4946730 were currently contacting 800 people who we know should be coming to the hospital tomorrow
4946731 we realise this is a major disruption to these people and were very sorry that its happened we hope theyre going to be very effective and when we reassess the situation tomorrow well see a decrease in cases and if we have fewer new cases then well see how things are tomorrow
4946732 i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4946733 l inconv nient s agissant des b ches t est qu elles constituent une esp ce d tuve dans laquelle la piscine peut devenir un v ritable bouillon de culture
4946734 il offre l avantage de l esth tisme une fois enroul il est plaqu sous la piscine
4946735 le caillebotis en bois ou en pvc recouvrant le volet est pratique puisqu il est permis de s y asseoir
4946736 having or claiming expert knowledge in one or more realms of the fine arts or of fashion
4946737 i saw you guys at the vnv nation gig last night and you rocked very hard p s stephen is hawt even if im too old to be a groupie
4946738 just now seeing pod set which is later than normal
4946739 plant development is real erratic not just between fields but even within fields
4946740 weve never had a year like this in the past
4946741 it was definitely a weird spring it affected everybody not just wyoming
4946742 we certainly want to see gas produced along with the water we dont just want to pump water
4946743 were pretty focused right now on the powder river basin
4946744 thats where the bigger problems have been with or complaints related to discharge of produced water
4946745 my idea was to learn english the money is not so important
4946746 this is for myself its wonderful if you can speak with people from the whole world not only bulgarians
4946747 cleaning bathroom or bedroom it doesnt matter to me i listen to bulgarian music or just thinking and the time is gone
4946748 if i have to be honest i dont like american food very much
4946749 even the bread is different taste if you take one apple from bulgaria and one apple from here american apple looks better but bulgarian apple tastes better
4946750 there are a lot of things to clean up on both sides of the ball but we saw some guys run the ball well we saw some nice blocks out there we saw some guys catching the ball and making yards after the catch
4946751 so each side of the ball had their highs and lows
4946752 at the time the dogs behavior had me form an opinion that the dog should be put down
4946753 if the dog is being used for research because it has cancer and is dying then that is a good use
4946754 this was clearly a case of attempted murder we could have been dealing with multiple casualties this morning and the devastation that would have caused throughout the community
4946755 there are a number of families out there who will be counting their blessings that they are not grieving for a loved one
4946756 the disregard that this shows for the lives of the local community and my officers is unbelievable
4946757 there are still a small number of people who refuse to live in peace refuse to accept that northern ireland wants to move on and that northern ireland has to move on
4946758 the finding is significant because it changes our understanding of how light input from the eye can affect activity and sleep patterns
4946759 this suggests that we have discovered an additional mechanism for regulating nocturnity and diurnity that is located in the light input pathways of the eye
4946760 the significance of this research for humans is that it could ultimately lead to new treatments for sleep disorders perhaps even eye drops that would target neural pathways to the brains central timekeeper
4946761 as a result our bodies and brains feel less difference between day and night
4946762 people are sleeping in front of the tv or nodding off during conversations and taking long afternoon naps this leads to less sleep at night in a way their sleep habits become more like babies and less like those of healthy adults who sleep in consolidated periods during the night
4946763 improves sleep and daytime vigilance helping to re organize the circadian system the bodys internal clock
4946764 were disappointed that union leadership forced us to this point
4946765 by failing to negotiate a new contract cwa leadership has denied its membership key union protections and benefits including arbitration its ability to automatically collect dues and bring new hires in as dues fees paying members of the union
4946766 the positive effect of an x linked gene on female fecundity tends to outweigh the negative effect of the gene on male fecundity
4946767 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones that when all of these shootings started
4946768 why would you put it out there that a group of people can defend themselves that like saying sic m to a dog
4946769 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4946770 or how about weapons retention training because they could go in to break up a fight in the cafeteria and lose their gun

4946782 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4946783 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4946784 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4946785 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4946786 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4946787 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4946788 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4946789 ecstatic and couldnt keep the smiles off their faces or their eyes off each other

4946807 skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4946808 russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
4946809 russia also holds vast petroleum wealth and this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that russia is clearly prepared to use
4946810 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed
4946811 the sceptre shall not turn aside from yehud ah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh comes and to him is the obedience of peoples

4946819 as soon as the storm passes through people are going to want to rent mopeds
4946820 the court still has jurisdiction to proceed with the case and there is no reason to dismiss the case
4946821 you are correct in identifying the shrinking of humanitarian space and the problems of confusions between the military and humanitarian purposes of foreigners who are here
4946822 the international rescue committee is firmly committed to protecting humanitarian space and distinguishing humanitarian workers from any military employees
4946823 theres an immediate need to bring all parties to a common consensus to take the country forward
4946824 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal

4946832 iran hopes to make a good use of its advantages in geopolitics energy and religion to expand relations with all sides and build up anti u s strength
4946833 irans diplomatic efforts have achieved some results which partly dispelled pressures from the united states
4946834 but due to geopolitical historical and religious reasons and irans hard line stance on the nuclear issue its diplomatic efforts are still confronted with challenges
4946835 a stern warning to ukraine that what can happen if it tries to move closer to nato is the division of the country
4946836 the acceleration of russias ongoing effort to increase its influence
4946837 when there are russian populations linked to russia then those territories could break away so if ukraine insists on joining nato part of its territory could split away

4946840 trouble had been brewing in the disputed south ossetian region for weeks as moscow backed militias skirmished with georgian troops yet russian brokered negotiations between the georgian government and the separatists had continued
4946841 but the first substantial face to face talks on august 7 fell through after a farcical chain of events in which the top russian diplomat claimed he was unable to attend the meeting in south ossetia because his car tyre had run flat

4946924 is er n ander land dat meer tot de verbeelding spreekt dan palestina niet in de laatste plaats door de constante stroom van indringende beelden die we in de media zien waarin palestijnen als daders of slachtoffers van geweld worden geportretteerd een tragedie die ons collectieve geweten gegijzeld houdt sinds 1948 we kunnen ons nauwelijks het dagelijks leven in palestina voorstellen dit is nu precies wat deze atlas zo bijzonder maakt het stelt de eenzijdige benadering van de westerse media aan de kaak en laat tegelijk zien hoe de situatie nu is in palestina
4946925 een bijzonder document is dat met een zachte stem een belangrijke boodschap geeft
4946926 er veel melancholie in de lucht hangt gecombineerd met zwartgallige humor en zelfs verveling de landkaart wordt op een vrolijke en sarcastische manier gevormd en vervormd alledaagse gebeurtenissen worden gekoesterd als kostbare bewijzen van veerkracht normaliteit kan op verschillende manieren en met verschillende middelen worden bereikt niemand zou stilstaan bij de vraag hoe kan ik een normaler leven leiden de vraag is hoe kan ik vasthouden aan elementen van normaliteit die de tand des tijds kunnen weerstaan palestina is als metafoor veel complexer en gelaagder dan het beeld dat met politieke retoriek wordt geschetst achter elke waarheid ligt een diepere waarheid palestina als metafoor heeft altijd tal van mogelijkheden geboden palestijnen zijn moe zij hebben even rust nodig de energie die zij investeren om net als ieder ander te zijn hun zoektocht naar een normaal leven en de hoop die zij levend houden leiden tot een verwrongen verhouding met tijd en plaats

4946933 my greatest moral failing and i am a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage

4946936 that doesnt mean people cant enter into legal agreements that doesnt mean that they dont have the right of all citizens
4946937 china ha castigado a la gente que concedi entrevistas a periodistas o solicit permisos para manifestarse lo que rompe su promesa de permitir la libertad de prensa y las manifestaciones en las zonas de protesta durante los juegos

4946953 a leading source of radical homosexual propaganda anti christian bigotry and radical transgender advocacy
4946954 i have been mocked over and over again by ungodly and unprincipled anti christian lesbians

4946959 gender identity got put in the draft of the platform and then there was never any serious debate about taking it out
4946960 mara keisling is a man who thinks hes a woman
4946961 andrea lafferty is a self righteous lobbyist who thinks shes a christian
4946962 if americans saw what these gender confused individuals looked like and what impact they will have on business practices theyd be outraged
4946963 imagine being forced to hire or retain a person who goes through half of a so called sex change operation should a business really have to deal with
4946964 his years as a troubadour gave him so much time working with people
4946965 people tell him he should be in the democratic party
4946966 but he says the place you have to change hearts is in the republican party
4946967 he sees it as his mission if he had 1 for every person in the mccain camp who agrees with him hed be set financially for a year but some people throw rocks at him
4946968 my dad thinks you can make a bigger impact in office
4946969 i think you can make a more important impact not being in office
4946970 my dad instilled in us to do something for somebody else
4946971 its not so much about politics but somehow giving back

4946973 but we know who our family and friends are and juans christian faith is unreal
4946974 with solutions to border immigration and guest worker issues so logical and obvious it can only be the handiwork of feuding washington special interest groups to have befuddled and complicated what is clear and simple
4946975 he rejects in principle the idea that we should have assimilation and we should have border enforcement
4946976 the point is i believe in many of his points
4946977 but to hear him talking the way he was expressing himself he was humble but he knew what he was doing
4946978 i will vote for him not totally because juan is working with him
4946979 that was his condition he would go work for mccain but he wouldnt take a paycheck
4946980 this storm poses a threat to the state of florida and to ensure that timely precautions are taken to protect communities throughout the state and the general welfare of the state ive signed this order
4946981 that is an extraordinary step i dont expect well take
4946982 we have no reason to believe theres any danger on monday
4946983 if it follows this path tuesday could be really wet
4946984 it frees us up to do what we need to do under florida statute
4946985 our trigger point is when a storm is at cuba

4947006 what weve done is integrate fashion politics and pop culture with history to give visitors a more comprehensive perspective of the sixties
4947007 ive never stopped telling stories about my experience at woodstock
4947008 when you see these films you realize how amazing it was that there were so many terrific performances given in such awful conditions
4947009 i was 26 when i got here and just never left
4947010 i stayed to help clean up and im still here is the festival over
4947011 i was so high i could have taken that picture
4947012 he said duke the vibe is still here hes right
4947013 you go out onto the field and youre back in the middle of it all
4947014 you can see it you can hear it you can taste it and then it vanishes it was a once in a lifetime experience it changed all of us who were there and therell never be anything like it again
4947015 like anybody else weve had a few borrowers lose their jobs and some bankruptcies
4947016 were only about 2 million in assets so if we lose a car loan to default its kind of a big hit
4947017 theres definitely a change in credit unions nonperforming assets and profitability either showing poor profitability or swinging over to a loss
4947018 we did see a slight decline in the star ratings
4947019 weve been hit hard in washington county for the last 15 years
4947020 its just a bleak economy and peoples wages dont rise with inflation
4947021 weve seen delinquencies and problem loans more in california florida nevada and arizona not in western pennsylvania it has been a relatively stable market
4947022 our examiner in may said we were out of the woods
4947023 but he doesnt want us to rest on our laurels
4947024 i guess its a function of the economy where we started getting some really slow payers
4947025 the doctor told me if i waited even a few months i would probably be dead
4947026 my father loved me no matter what but to my mother i was an embarrassment
4947027 one little boy said lady does it hurt to be that fat i told him that if it had happened all at once it probably would have of course his mother was horrified
4947028 once when i was in a mall a woman came up to me and told me i had no business being out in public i didnt know what to say
4947029 i would see the pity in peoples eyes and it was so awful
4947030 i would always be self conscious about what i ate because i didnt want people to see me eating a lot and thinking worse of me i would never go to an all you can eat place
4947031 why bariatric surgery didnt work so well even 20 years ago is that we failed to address the psychological issues and the need for support beforehand
4947032 i describe the procedure as a tool like a rake
4947033 if you leave the rake leaning against the wall it doesnt work
4947034 one of the dilemmas of people addicted to food unlike people addicted to chemicals is they have to continue to eat they cant become abstinent
4947035 when i had kids i spent some of that time on welfare so what i could afford was cheap and high calorie
4947036 in middle school the kids threw me into lockers and called me names
4947037 not that long ago somebody said if i looked like you id kill myself
4947038 its all right i live here by myself and i dont purchase much
4947039 since i run my own business i have no pension
4947040 if we get ill we have to depend on ourselves to pay the bills fortunately we are in good health
4947041 these twin pillars of social security and pensions now cover much of the work force
4947042 its a big reason why this government is so popular
4947043 a startling share of chinese now believe the primary responsibility for caring for the elderly should be with society as a whole the state
4947044 and if the state fails to deliver on that expectation it could be a real social and political crisis
4947045 hes got a wealth of experience in a lot of different communities including fast growing communities
4947046 ill wait to see what happens before making that judgment
4947047 absolutely based on his experience background and willingness to embrace new ideas
4947048 very goal oriented i think thats why the communication part in terms of where youre headed has suffered
4947049 i think were at a crossroads where the public as well as stakeholders elected officials and others are beginning to look to hart to come up with some solutions

4947052 a rising dollar typically pushes oil prices lower as investors who buy crude and other commodities as hedges against inflation start dumping their positions to cut their losses a stronger greenback also makes dollar denominated commodities more expensive to overseas buyers further eroding demand
4947053 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4947054 my gut instinct is that there will be a wide disparity about what rates are quoted on these sites and what they actually end up with and not necessarily due to the borrower
4947055 all the sites may not collect all the data thats necessary to give an actual price quote
4947056 its easy reliable accurate and fast theres no bait and switch
4947057 what i learned most about playing sports is to cheat i want all the kids who see this cheat if you cant beat them cheat and do drugs kids you learn that confidence is 99 of what it is you do literally i went from one season to another where i didnt become really become much of a hitter i just realized that i could hit the ball and instead of getting up to the plate and wondering if im going to hit the ball i wonder where i want to hit the ball suddenly i was a hitter

4947060 highly gifted people have a number of personality traits that set them apart and that are not obviously connected to the traits of intelligence iq or creativity that are most often used to define the category many of these traits have to do with their particularly intense feelings and emotions others with their sometimes awkward social interactions these traits make that these people are typically misunderstood and underestimated by peers by society and usually even by themselves as such most of their gifts are actually underutilized and they rarely fulfill their full creative potential this is particularly true for gifted women as they dont fit the stereotypes that society has either of women or of gifted people typically seen as men

4947085 heres a thought experiment for you imagine the mid 1990s just before super mario 64 was due to be released for nintendos new console the nintendo 64
4947086 commissioners were appointed and matters were put quickly in hand
4947087 the site was chosen the money voted and by early november the work was begun it is probable a temporary light was established on the island
4947088 the reality is that the early voyagers who came to these shores could not survive for a single day without the help of the indigenous people
4947089 i believe that the greatest accomplishment of the atlantic conference will be that it provokes reflection and discussion
4947090 we didnt think it would rain as much as it did
4947091 even our extra socks got wet and we were in the bathroom ringing out our shorts
4947092 my worry has always been that something would happen to my girls im just hoping that the research comes through
4947093 it was challenging at times but far less challenging than it is to have breast cancer ultimately this is going to save someones life
4947094 the new breast health centre was something we really needed and weve made them sit up and say nows the time
4947095 heres a thought experiment for you imagine the mid 1990s just before super mario 64 was due to be released for nintendos new console the nintendo 64
4947096 i would have walked because it was something that was actually ok walking i havent made the injury worse
4947097 if i felt i was doing some serious damage i would have stopped its horrible when you have to drop out especially when its the olympic games so many people have worked so hard to get me here
4947098 in some ways its almost quicker to keep going because if you stop youre just left out there on your own
4947099 they couldnt have been better conditions when i started to struggle i got a lot of traffic and that was annoying i was getting lots of fumes as well as everything else
4947100 a pain came up into my calves it wasnt a sharp pain if it had been like when the stress fracture was bad i would just have stopped i felt like i was just running on one leg
4947101 i wanted to finish it was really frustrating because i felt really comfortable i could talk and tell husband gary what was wrong
4947102 my calf was just so bad i had to stretch it the pain felt like it was coming up from my foot early in the race i had this weird feeling that someone was kicking my foot away while i was running
4947103 im really happy with sixth a medal would have been nice but sixth is the best british performance and im glad i ran a sensible race i dug in at the end but they were just a bit too strong for me
4947104 ive trained in much harder conditions im surprised a lot of other people didnt do better
4947105 well be releasing the final version of our online gaming economy study this evening
4947106 which will make the twilight hours at the local book shops very interesting
4947107 but only because of the high expectations and standards of our online gaming economy project we have worked tirelessly for about a year now and we hope to release the best review of online gaming economy thought in decades
4947108 after next weeks pre release editions go out we expect to see a mad dash for bookstores on the 20th when the general release of the online gaming economy book takes place
4947109 and that will mean big sales long hours and lots of money
4947110 basically were looking at new ideas within the online gaming economy realm of thought that have never really been put in writing before
4947111 and this is what makes the release such an exciting event for our community new ideas means new developments and success for our area
4947112 most individuals with a doctorate degree with relevant experience in the online gaming economy field are offered very high paying jobs while those with lesser education must make up for their shortcomings with a solid background of online gaming economy related experience
4947113 this great work will mean high profits for our firm
4947114 and were also very honored that the author and student research team chose our firm to share its work with the world

4947118 mugabe must go red card for mugabe the world stands with zimbabwes people
4947119 we are here to let the sadc leaders know that any negotiations without the wishes of the people will not succeed and thats what we are here for
4947120 we dont want elite talks aimed at parceling out power we want talks that will benefit all the people and as women we are pushing for our recognition its not too late
4947121 the differences are irreparable both parties want power but they are not prepared to share it we now have to take the matter away from politicians and establish a government of national unity to run the country for two years then we can have fresh elections
4947122 sadc and au must put a timeline to these talks they cannot drag on like this if they fail then a transitional authority headed by neither mugabe nor tsvangirai should be put in place
4947123 yes the talks have been problematic but we have to acknowledge that they are offering an alternative the only problem is that they are being held in secrecy and they are elitist they are sort of alienating political leaders from their constituencies the peoples voice is not visible
4947124 if this is not the case the mdc should return to its constituency and consult the people on further action
4947125 the most important thing is that the talks have offered ordinary zimbabweans a chance to breathe after being choked by violence and given political parties time to reflect on what is going wrong in zimbabwe
4947126 its time for sadc to rein in mugabe because democracy is being subverted when the person with the least votes determines how the talks should go its a fraud if they are failing to agree then they should try something else a transitional authority is the way to go
4947127 we would rather prefer a transitional authority for two years at most we will not be under any illusion that sadc will provide an answer to the zimbabwean crisis the deal that sadc is negotiating for is elitist for us its aluta continua

4947211 it was definitely a tale of two halves columbus coach sigi schmid said
4947212 the first half was not good but the character of the team is great they listened to what we had to say at halftime we came out in the second half with a lot more energy
4947213 i thought we had an outstanding first half dallas coach schellas hyndman said
4947214 i almost thought we were the home team there for a while we were unfortunate we did not score more than one goal
4947215 this will be my fifth year with this coaching staff theyve seen me for four years
4947216 i thought my decision making was pretty good and we had some nice plays down field

4947218 i just couldnt live on one healthy foot anymore let alone try to skate
4947219 weve tried everything to avoid surgery because we knew it would mean missing a chunk of the season but nothing worked
4947220 ryan has been bothered by this condition in his foot for some time
4947221 he consulted with a number of specialists in an effort to correct the problem without surgery but it was ultimately determined that surgery was the best path to take for his general well being and for his career
4947222 i need to perform better than i did and i know that is the expectation
4947223 but ive always thought skating was the biggest part of my game and last season i couldnt skate like i can

4947234 on the internet nothing goes away we must learn to live with total transparency even if it hurts
4947235 kids want to express their opinions there is no way to stop them

4947243 with the initial shock of high gas prices fading consumers are returning to rationality and again viewing gas consumption as just one of many factors when considering their next vehicle and as gas prices actually decline this trend could accelerate
4947244 automakers made some big changes to their production plans based on preferences in the second quarter
4947245 but if gas prices continue to recede to the long term trend line automakers may find that they overreacted to a temporary shift in consumers preferences

4947251 we are mortgaging the future of our children and grandchildren at record rates and that is not only an issue of fiscal irresponsibility its an issue of immorality
4947252 when we sit around here and talk about all these tax cuts and we say its our money your money and mine i think we ought to be honest with the american people in the first place its also our debt and its our childrens debt but secondly a tax cut isnt really a tax cut long term unless you reduce spending because then it becomes a tax increase on your children so were inflicting this awful bill not simply on ourselves but most importantly on our kids and it is that phenomenon that is very troublesome

4947270 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
4947271 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
4947272 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
4947273 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
4947274 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
4947275 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well

4947327 my first thoughts are that its a circuit that we havent raced at before and its got barriers all around it
4947328 i think the whole of formula one is very excited about going to valencia its a beautiful city and it will be great to be racing around the streets there
4947329 we have a simulator at our uk base as do most teams and spending a lot of time on that has been vital in terms of learning the circuit
4947330 with a simulator youre not getting the complete feeling of the car but you are gaining understanding of the distances and the braking points so its very useful
4947331 we have some very fast circuits like monza spa and silverstone on the calendar and then the slower circuits like monaco and hungary and were expecting valencia to be somewhere in the middle

4947333 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4947334 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4947335 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4947336 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4947337 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4947338 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further

4947343 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4947344 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4947345 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4947346 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4947347 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4947348 the formal process isnt yet completed when the requirements are met then it will be carried out
4947349 i am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world
4947350 we have an unexpected baby boy do you want him
4947351 if you live each day as if it was your last someday youll most certainly be right
4947352 if today were the last day of my life would i want to do what i am about to do today
4947353 it has not started yet the question of withdrawal is being considered now and the decision will be taken as the situation in the region is stabilized
4947354 what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
4947355 earlier they had given resistance but afterward they had withdrawn
4947356 enjoy the opening ceremony since chances are they wont win any medals
4947357 no cumple con el principio de razonabilidad en tanto que no existen razones constitucionales que la justifiquen
4947358 personalmente creo que abundan las razones jur dicas para declarar inconstitucional la ley
4947359 es el momento de la serenidad porque es momento de entender que el debate del aborto no empez con la ley del df es un tema que empez hace 40 a os que hay una experiencia hist rica de hace 40 a os
4947360 they are just as dirty as when we boys were coming in from two a days in football
4947361 you can look pretty and dress up but then in sports youve got to have some fun
4947362 you never know the toughness of a girl until you see them out there playing softball or soccer sports bring it out of us but then off the field youre just a girl
4947363 one of the main aspects of girls fast pitch softball is commitment
4947364 i got to see the whole field and i played a big part by being in tune with the pitcher it was a really good position to be encouraging to everyone
4947365 we were getting down on the girls just like we would do with guys yelling throwing our hats it didnt take us long to figure out that that didnt work with girls or with their mothers
4947366 its been good for me personally to be more of an instructor rather than just getting on them girls will get their feelings hurt they can get emotional
4947367 its almost better to call a girl over to you and not get onto her in a public way
4947368 now girls heres the most important piece of information the outfit color
4947369 this is a gift to be used for gods glory
4947370 what you want to teach the girls is that they can glorify the lord in sports win or lose by how they act on and off the field how they treat the other team win or lose and how they compete
4947371 is probably more passionate in the regard that she is much more vocal at the games
4947372 i like to just go and sit there in my lawn chair
4947373 i get so nervous when the rebels are playing that i cant get nervous watching my boys
4947374 i sort of take credit for him becoming a baseball coach
4947375 i said why dont you try to be a coach
4947376 it has so many great things to offer culturally its such a neat neat place to raise kids and everywhere you go you see somebody you know
4947377 our faith is a big part of who we are we are very involved it doesnt matter if the rebels win or lose we still have our faith and there is no pressure
4947378 the one negative is i am not at home as much as i would like to be able to spend time with the family to be able to have them come to the field and spend time with them and be a part of things is special
4947379 its been interesting to watch the parents with little league and dizzy dean and usssa
4947380 they just live it with the kids i think sometimes the parents take it harder than the kids
4947381 i try to be their dad and not the coach when they do something well im excited and proud when they dont do something so well i feel for them just like any parent would
4947382 to do it in a manner that is easier to accept
4947383 not to do it when they are on the field
4947384 much like a parent a coach wants his player to give his best effort be responsible and develop the characteristics that every young man and woman should learn i really believe thats why we have intercollegiate athletics its to teach life lessons that cant be learned in class they teach how to handle adversity and work
4947385 thats the neat thing about athletics sometimes you cant remember where you put the keys but you can close your eyes and remember something so vividly that you are right there in that moment again
4947386 sound fundamentals in every aspect of the game i guess thats why we are where we are
4947387 lots of the girls work hard on their own and with their dads
4947388 were different but bob and i compliment each other very well
4947389 it was a bit like new york city suddenly coming online overnight
4947390 someone lifted a curtain and there was this gleaming city full of people who wanted to spend money on wine
4947391 i came over in march which was just after the duty cut and thought well heres an opportunity lets do it now
4947392 i would actually argue that hong kong is already the wine trading centre for asia up to 23 percent of all wine sold at auction internationally is sold to hong kong buyers but the effect of the duty cut has been dramatic
4947393 within the first three or four days we had 10 container loads of rare and fine wine confirmed to be shipped over we had prepared by opening a second facility and are currently opening our third to cater for wines coming in
4947394 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
4947395 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
4947396 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
4947397 theyre huge buyers of classified growth of the latours and the lafites but theyre not saving it
4947398 that markets all about showing off going out with your friends and saying look ive got an 82 latour here lets drink it
4947399 people have always been talking about how digital media will take away audiences from tv
4947400 thats just not happening maybe this will be a wake up call for a lot of people
4947401 its just completely on a different scale from anything else
4947402 were living in an era of audience fragmentation but heres an event that isnt fragmenting but is going through the roof
4947403 ce sommet nous offre lopportunit daider les parties dans les pourparlers au zimbabwe conclure leurs n gociations
4947404 une personne est morte dans la ville de fond v rettes et une a disparu dans le sud o les responsables locaux avaient commenc vacuer des personnes r sidant dans des zones risque
4947405 les pluies pourraient provoquer des inondations et des glissements de terrains pouvant mettre des vies en p ril

4947408 augmenter la vigilance et surveiller laccumulation des pr cipitations ainsi que le niveau des rivi res et la situation des barrages
4947409 not just as a car but as a way of life
4947410 usually 2cv owners dont get tickets policeman just smile almost everybody in france had a 2cv at some time in their youth so theyre nostalgic and not angry with us
4947411 the 2cv is a symbol of france i mean like the eiffel tower or the french baguette
4947412 when you are in a 2cv you escape it is an experience in itself its an adventure and you feel like youre in a cosy cocoon
4947413 dont hate me because of who i am hate yourself because of who you arent
4947414 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god
4947415 i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus
4947416 for all have sinned and come shortof the glory of god
4947417 to miss the mark and so not share in the prize
4947418 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway
4947419 he has a crooked spine isnt he the ugliest thing youve ever seen
4947420 made sad little noises when you accidentally stepped on them
4947421 the game was witnessed by eight hundred or a thousand people
4947422 though few of them were up to the science of the work on the gridiron they understood when mississippi was victorious and were unstinted in their cheerings
4947423 we had all these plays designed to get the ball to cosmo lloyd but i would just take the ball on the run almost every time ramming it down the field
4947424 all the boys from all age groups would gather out there at the bowl each saturday and play football all day long
4947425 there wasnt anything for little people who grew up during those days
4947426 we didnt have any darn football shoes or pad you wore whatever you had we had no equipment
4947427 the formative and plastic years of youth are our unique opportunity the training of youth in spirit mind and body is the business of the ymca
4947428 at the very foundation of our hopes stand our youth
4947429 who must carry more and more responsibilities they must be youth of sound character
4947430 come to think of it im not sure we had shoulder pads
4947431 our philosophy was to complement the schools with a little athletic program because they didnt have them at the time
4947432 it is our purpose to be strong in body mind and spirit and to live in a christian way in our homes schools churches and neighborhoods
4947433 they made a good showing in game play and many times during the match seemed the better team
4947434 watkins had a big guy faster than anybody we had
4947435 my dad bought me a new helmet when i was in the 6th grade i remember my dad being at the games and that made me feel good especially when we lost
4947436 i think watkins was some ungodly maroon color ive always been an old lineman you know leading with my chin ive been accused of playing too without a helmet too we had those single bars then i think we finally graduated to double bars but i dont think everybody had a face mask yet
4947437 i went from playing in the 5th quarter at gra y games to playing in the capital bowl for st joseph high school beating murrah to playing in the mississippi all star football game in 1974
4947438 i played tight end and wore alan page style forearm pads coach called a tight end reverse i took it to the house and noticed my much older brothers cheering on the sidelines i spontaneously did my billy white shoes johnson imitation it wasnt pretty and i still catch grief from my brothers
4947439 i remember having to tell our coach that a lead blocker probably was a good idea on a sweep i recall the taste and smell of that just boiled mouthpiece and hutch helmets that left a dent on your forehead and every other play being a cross buck left or right
4947440 little did we know that we would be playing in temps in the 30s against what turned out to be a seventh grade all star team of kids from the parochial schools around jackson they annihilated us
4947441 certain schools got overly competitive and the y was adamant about every child plays
4947442 wed find coaches that might coach the same team for several years and just build a dynasty
4947443 i think a lot of people didnt want their children in the danger that football represented
4947444 son youve got to square your feet and fire off
4947445 you cant quit here and you cant quit in life
4947446 gra y football taught me that with persistence and effort you can achieve your goals
4947447 youve got to focus more try harder and put forth a better effort
4947448 nothing like thats ever been done in hattiesburg it was a pretty aggressive move
4947449 pride and the look on all the kids faces on opening day
4947450 es una verg enza que no se permita realizar la sesi n del consejo

4947456 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4947457 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4947458 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4947459 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4947460 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4947461 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4947482 she tried to put the water hose on it to do what we could do but by that time it was too late
4947483 it was too much fire the water hose wouldnt do nothing
4947484 you could hear them screaming but there was nothing you could do
4947485 in the same area on the first floor at the rear
4947486 but the bodies did appear to have some severe burns
4947487 it has been nothing but fun the biggest thing is that nothing is impossible

4947491 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4947492 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4947493 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
4947494 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport
4947495 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me

4947508 supporting the troops is getting behind their mission and them by encouraging them and telling them that you know they can win if you think bringing all the troops home tomorrow solves the complex issue of the global war on communism or you believe that there is no global war on communism youve obviously lost some brain cells from your drug days or youre a democrat or both

4947587 families in oakland county are shelling out hundreds of dollars at the pump while peters is fattening his campaign wallet with money from a group that wants gas prices to be even higher
4947588 peters should donate that money to people who need it and he ought to renounce the sierra clubs endorsement
4947589 gary peters is beholden to the radical agenda of an organization that would have oakland countys families pay through the nose for higher gas prices
4947590 the debts candidate peters owes the sierra club will mean an even steeper price tag for oakland countys families

4947598 home prices in the us are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009
4947599 prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
4947600 are likely to remain substantially elevated this year and next and home prices are likely to decline further on a national basis
4947601 cities such as los angeles las vegas and miami which saw the largest price gains
4947602 the rising share of foreclosed homes in overall sales bodes negatively for home prices
4947603 the light at the end of the tunnel is a faint and distant one further the risks to this outlook weigh heavily on the downside with the main risk being the potential for financial markets to unravel further
4947604 it will be well into 2009 before the market works off all the excesses accumulated during the housing boom

4947624 we are still bound by british raj law which criminalizes homosexuality the british introduced the law there is never a history of homophobia or any law against homosexuals in this country it was only when the british came that this law was introduced section 377 of the indian penal code after so many years when the british have quit india this law is still here we want this law also to quit india
4947625 india is the largest democracy in the world in this democracy gay people should have the right to express their feelings i am also here for the amendment of article 377 in the constitution i request the government to pay attention to this
4947626 at this time it does not look like funding will be available for
4947627 i will keep everyone updated as i have any information

4947629 my phone is off my bills arent paid ive been to a food pantry already
4947630 current signage in your block of 17th street prohibit parking
4947631 the city thinks it can escape its responsibility to our neighborhood
4947632 were being treated as a second class neighborhood and the city continues to ignore our needs we are literally being sold out
4947633 i understand they want to see their neighborhood stay the same way it was when they bought their houses
4947634 anybody who has gotten one payment late its so hard to catch up sometimes especially in this economy and with everything thats been going on
4947635 its very unfortunate that people are losing their homes that they have worked hard for and made commitments and life changes and now changes in circumstances have pushed them to the brink of where they are losing part of the american dream
4947636 i think a great deal if anything has to do with the economy with an actual turndown in many segments of the economy many who are homeowners and citizens of southwestern illinois cannot control job layoffs and of course the villain is to look at subprime mortgage lenders i think behind everyone of those foreclosures can be a difficult story of rising numbers
4947637 the severity of the problem is even deeper than the basic numbers would indicate
4947638 i can only speak for my office but foreclosures are up
4947639 i have a couple of agents who specialize in foreclosures and primarily thats all they do they are all very busy
4947640 it seems that they begin foreclosure after they had refinanced and refinanced and refinanced and used their house like an atm
4947641 and theyre upside down on their house because the market is declining and people are beginning to have to sell in the last two or three years
4947642 for those people unfortunately enough of them find themselves in foreclosure situations
4947643 the likeliness of them managing to get out from under it successfully appears to be slim or slimmer
4947644 the bone of contention now is the legal fees that theyre hitting me with
4947645 now im worried about paying the mortgage and making the next car payment
4947646 what theyre seeing is about 70 percent of homeowners facing bankruptcy are not talking with lenders
4947647 they try to get help but cant get help and are moving out and mailing the key but when they try to get an apartment they find out that they have a low credit rating its kind of a double whammy
4947648 its not a significant percentage thats less than 1 percent of all of our overall housing
4947649 but its 100 people losing their homes and that is a big deal
4947650 its taken care of and catching up is not that big of a deal right now its just that im just so angry over the legal fees because you cant get your head above water as soon as you think you see the light theyre going to come at you with some legal fees and property taxes are due when are you going to pay that and if you dont stick to this if youre one day late then theyre going to take you to court
4947651 i know i signed a contract and its my responsibility to fulfill that contract and im fully aware of that and im trying as im sure so many people have my absolute best to fulfill that contract
4947652 this office will investigate what further charges if any may be filed in this matter and whether the disposition may be set aside
4947653 i hope we can work something out to make sure you arent led astray on this occasion

4947657 ive been looking for this book for years it is the definitive book on evaluation for adult education and human resource development practitioners

4947660 it was a bit like new york city suddenly coming online overnight
4947661 someone lifted a curtain and there was this gleaming city full of people who wanted to spend money on wine
4947662 i came over in march which was just after the duty cut and thought well heres an opportunity lets do it now
4947663 i would actually argue that hong kong is already the wine trading centre for asia up to 23 percent of all wine sold at auction internationally is sold to hong kong buyers but the effect of the duty cut has been dramatic
4947664 within the first three or four days we had 10 container loads of rare and fine wine confirmed to be shipped over we had prepared by opening a second facility and are currently opening our third to cater for wines coming in
4947665 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
4947666 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
4947667 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
4947668 theyre huge buyers of classified growth of the latours and the lafites but theyre not saving it
4947669 that markets all about showing off going out with your friends and saying look ive got an 82 latour here lets drink it

4947682 im not sure employers are recognizing the importance of hands on

4947701 your ministry has created a monopoly and only allowed white showman to import these batteries
4947702 his excellency the president has therefore directed that your office avails an explanation to him not later than tomorrow 8th august 2008 so that he explains to the public on radio
4947703 you re issue a licence to kampala modernity ltd because this is a liberalised economy
4947704 i dont operate like that i have checked my desk and that letter is not there may be its still in the registry
4947705 i started doing business humbly and i have come a long way
4947706 i am not sure whether mukwaya has given an explanation but the president was concerned
4947707 finance wrote a letter to the manufacturers in china that if they dont appoint one agent government would ban the sale of their batteries
4947708 one day they will create a monopoly on roads they will say they are the only ones to use certain roads

4947721 its endurance its strength its pressure he made the pressure putt in the u s open he won the tour de france and he knocked out the best fighter in the world in the 16th round with an uppercut
4947722 he did absolutely everything sport is supposed to be and he did it with a smile on his face and hes a good kid
4947723 the only thing that i would have wanted to change
4947724 was the 200 fly i think i can go faster in that event it was a wardrobe malfunction but it was something we took care of and we were able to fix
4947725 other than that i think this was a perfect week
4947726 hes beginning to set a whole new standard for his sport and for america
4947727 the united states olympic committee is very proud of him as is usa swimming and basically every citizen in our country and in many other countries
4947728 hes a true athlete and represents whats best about the olympic movement

4947848 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4947849 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban

4947857 we need to make policy changes to ensure that this never happens again
4947858 the question is how to best fight an administration policy that permits such practices
4947859 serve in consultative roles to interrogation and information gathering processes for national security related purposes
4947860 others maintain that you have to be present to make it clear that these acts are never permissible
4947861 behavioral science teams make sure everything a detainee sees or hears enhances the interrogation process they are involved in the whole effort to break detainees down
4947862 its not enough to say that you cant participate in torture its the interrogations

4947868 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4947869 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile

4947890 a recorder of the progress of time a nurturer of modern society and an inspiration for civic awareness
4947891 all history is about roads until the airplane came along
4947892 the reason were sitting here today is because the road came through
4947893 it was the only way through the two counties after a flood that you didnt have to cross a river
4947894 when the military cut the road they werent just going off into uncharted territory
4947895 it looked very much like any other log home with a spinning wheel and a cast iron skillet
4947896 in the 1820s the cherokee nation was only a fraction of what it once was
4947897 then three things happened that were bad for the cherokees
4947898 the trail of tears really started on the front porch of every cherokee household
4947899 the worst conditions really were during the roundup when they used bayonets to herd them conditions were similar to civil war prison camps they werent quite as bad along the trip because they could travel and have food along the way
4947900 she was 13 and shed traveled with her family 1 800 miles
4947901 do you know how close that is to indian territory she died within sight of it

4947903 his goal early in life was to be a stagecoach driver by age 19 he was a driver and owned his own livery
4947904 in 1840 gold was found in california and many people migrated to the west
4947905 in 1850 california threatens succession if there is no mail
4947906 and he had a couple of partners in the business one named wells and one named fargo
4947907 in one year he had accumulated 250 concord coaches and 500 other vehicles such as water wagons hay wagons and lighter celerity coaches
4947908 he had 3 000 tons of hay stored along 2 800 miles and water wells dug at relay posts 12 to 14 miles apart he hired 1 200 employees including superintendents road bosses drivers guards conductors keepers blacksmiths harness makers hostlers and clerks he spent 1 million which would now be 15 million he started with 146 stations and increased this to 200
4947909 he wore a top hat and a yellow duster and black pants stuffed into black boots
4947910 they traveled day and night giving new meaning to are we there yet
4947911 his wife ran the station there he built a hotel across the street and the stable set about where fayetteville city hall is today
4947912 the butterfield overland express was the first overland transcontinental mail by stagecoach
4947913 it was the longest stagecoach line in world history 2 812 miles the butterfield stage line was a major factor in the settlement of arkansas and the west before the civil war
4947914 troops march down the road and they encounter other troops thats where the battle happens thats what happened at pea ridge
4947915 the battle was there because of the road from st louis to fort smith everybody used the same road the army went up and down it many times going to the indian territory
4947916 pea ridge was the largest battle west of the mississippi
4947917 arkansas at that time was the hinterlands the frontier was 20 miles away
4947918 the road was only as wide as a wagon and marching at just four men across it took a long time
4947919 the parks visitor center is where curtis makes last stand
4947920 it was so loud they could hear it in fayetteville and springfield it was the first thunder in the ozarks in march it was artillery
4947921 it was stocked full of food pickles sardines oysters eggs
4947922 they were eating not fighting and their ammunition train was far behind they had no ammunition
4947923 the wire road got more use in december 1862 union brig gen frances herron on his way to fayetteville passed the body of his dead horse lying there from a previous battle they used these roads all the time
4947924 people from the same county fought on both sides the first washington artillery for the union was out of fayetteville
4947925 the only people left were those who had no way to go
4947926 that tears at society it was so bad in northwest arkansas they built fortified towns southern towns and northern towns and set up blockades of the mail for the most part it worked
4947927 it was very dangerous tough living for those who stayed here

4947933 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4947934 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4947935 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4947936 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4947937 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4947938 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4947939 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4947940 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4947941 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4947942 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

4947956 and he is the most dangerous we know about him
4947957 five months they wanted to take my father i told them take me instead
4947958 we invite their parents to come and visit with them they actually have movie nights we have looked through every one of these files these juveniles are dangerous
4947959 he told me his brother was there with him but he really wanted to see his mother could he please call his mother he was crying
4947960 the iraqi regime operated a gulag for dissidents and incredibly enough a prison for young children now the gates to that prison have been thrown wide open and we are putting the dictators political prisons and torture chambers out of business

4947964 it has not started yet the question of withdrawal is being considered now and the decision will be taken as the situation in the region is stabilized
4947965 what is going on is probably just preparation not actual withdrawal
4947966 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4947967 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4947968 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4947969 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4947970 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4947971 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4947972 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4947973 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4947974 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4947975 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4947976 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4947977 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4947978 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4947979 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4947980 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4947981 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4947982 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4947983 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4947984 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4947985 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4947986 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4947987 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4947988 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4947989 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4947990 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4947991 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4947992 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4947993 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4947994 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4947995 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4947996 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4947997 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4947998 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4947999 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4948000 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4948001 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4948002 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4948003 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4948004 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4948005 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4948006 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4948007 its better not to have a deal than to have a bad deal
4948008 to whom do all these ministers report can you dismiss them if they breach its fundamental
4948009 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit

4948013 ang ating gobyerno ay hindi nireresolba ang mga problema ng ating mga migranteng manggagawa
4948014 sinabi po ninyo na ang mga ofw ay bagong bayani subalit sa pagkamatay ng aking kapatid nawala ang kanyang pangarap the government says that ofws are modern day heroes but with the death of my sister her dream of giving a better life to the family was also shattered my sister left weighing 47 kilos but when her body was returned to us she weighed only 32 kilos nananawagan po ako sa arroyo government na imbestigahan ang pagkamatay ng aking kapatid
4948015 how good migration governance can contribute to development and how development policies can impact on migration
4948016 the presence of the international migrants alliance in all global regions will pose the most formidable challenge to the global forum on migration and development we being the grassroots migrants who are at the receiving end of numerous anti migrant attacks are the living proofs of the global forum on migration and developments anti migrant agenda and direction
4948017 the campaign against the global forum on migration and development will culminate in an international assembly of migrants and refugees from october 28 30 2008
4948018 the international assembly of migrants and refugees will be the genuine assembly for migrants where real and concrete issues shall be discussed the international assembly for migrants and refugees will speak for the grassroots migrants
4948019 gma said i care is this the care she was talking about i care with the migrants having 29 victims in death row i care with the migrants having more than ten thousand stranded ofws i care with the migrants having 23 mysterious deaths i care with the migrants having so many charges from their remittances
4948020 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4948021 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4948022 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4948023 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4948024 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4948025 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4948026 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4948027 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4948028 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4948029 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4948030 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4948031 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4948032 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4948033 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4948034 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4948035 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4948036 who are open to doing something on the production side
4948037 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4948038 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4948039 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4948040 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4948041 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4948042 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4948043 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4948044 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4948045 the right to a fair and public trial is a bedrock principle of democracy
4948046 unfortunately in this regard members of the armed services have fewer rights than those granted to criminal defendants in civilian courts
4948047 we believe that at a minimum the armed services should create an easily accessible docket of information listing those charged details regarding the charges against them and the date and time of their trials and pre trials
4948048 lantropologia dovr riesaminare dalle fondamenta il suo ritratto delluomo moderno tra 40 000 a 10 000 anni or sono
4948049 il lavoro del prof protsch sembrerebbe provare che gli umani anatomicamente moderni ed i neanderthal avrebbero convissuto forse fino al punto di interagire e di ibridarsi tutto questo adesso viene messo in dubbio
4948050 e profondamente imbarazzante naturalmente luniversit si trova in una posizione davvero scomoda al riguardo
4948051 sono stato tentato dal diavolo non so come potermi scusare per quello che ho fatto

4948053 how many of us died in the streams of light
4948054 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4948055 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4948056 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4948057 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4948058 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4948059 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4948060 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4948061 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4948062 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4948063 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4948064 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4948065 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4948066 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4948067 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4948068 any time somebody dies un expectedly and the mechanism of death is not evident we have to treat it as suspicious
4948069 but at this time i do not believe that there is any reason for bridgewater residents to be con cerned
4948070 it was a bit like new york city suddenly coming online overnight
4948071 someone lifted a curtain and there was this gleaming city full of people who wanted to spend money on wine
4948072 i came over in march which was just just after the duty cut and thought well heres an opportunity lets do it now
4948073 i would actually argue that hong kong is already the wine trading centre for asia up to 23 percent of all wine sold at auction internationally is sold to hong kong buyers but the effect of the duty cut has been dramatic
4948074 within the first three or four days we had 10 container loads of rare and fine wine confirmed to be shipped over we had prepared by opening a second facility and are currently opening our third to cater for wines coming in
4948075 hong kong just adds an extra stop youre still going to have to go into china and deal with all the bureaucracy
4948076 thats fine if youre importing 200 cases of standard wine but not if its six bottles of 96 lafite
4948077 the net result is the fine wine market in mainland china is not going to develop at all apart from consumption
4948078 theyre huge buyers of classified growth of the latours and the lafites but theyre not saving it
4948079 that markets all about showing off going out with your friends and saying look ive got an 82 latour here lets drink it
4948080 no other issue is likely to dominate the political scene
4948081 i never got invited you dont go to the olympics just to say i am going to go especially because of who i am
4948082 i am going to sit there and watch michael phelps break my record anonymously thats almost demeaning to me it is not almost it is

4948085 one can say there is peace in port harcourt but are the conditions that gave rise to the gangsterism and killings resolved the answer is no
4948086 what you have seen the insurgency is a political device by the youths to draw the attention of the authorities to the unsettled issues in the oil and gas producing regions of nigeria
4948087 if communities could directly elect their political representatives without rigging you would automatically disarm the militants
4948088 we will have moments of quiet and moments of disturbance
4948089 sesungguhnya segala sesuatu yang kamu lakukan untuk salah seorang dari saudara ku yang paling hina ini kamu telah melakukannya untuk aku
4948090 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4948091 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4948092 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4948093 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4948094 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4948095 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4948096 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4948097 here just reach your hand in here its all right she is small but she is still yours and she is alive ellie feel her
4948098 didnt you say that to be in heaven is perfect bliss

4948100 you john you have been pushed you are being called i dont think being a contractor is your lifes work
4948101 for a while it looked like obama could be the rare african american leader whose race was nearly invisible and he may still be hes post civil rights oprah branded with that classically american blend of a mother from the heartland and a father from a distant shore and after that iowa victory speech people felt something had passed into our collective rear view mirror without actually saying what that something was now it looks like every mention of race from the overblown dust up with senator hillary clinton this week to the calculated comments comparing him to sidney poitier is bad for obama a victory in south carolina with its heavy black vote will be seen as one dimensional he needs people to look at him and see john kennedy or the beatles or tiger woods in his first masters tournament he needs people to see youth a break with the past style under pressure when they see black this or black that even a positive black first its trouble
4948102 the racial issue we confront today is not a sectional problem but a national problem injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere
4948103 i see no reason why race has anything to do with obamas candidacy
4948104 what are you going to do to protect our freedoms
4948105 you know imagine that a woman and a black man running for president but really what difference should it make you know what not bill richardson a latino when do you stop looking at their bodies and start changing this mess you know
4948106 there was a survival mechanism depending on slavery and segregation
4948107 ive been to the mountaintop i would like to live a long life i just want to do gods will
4948108 we are climbing a great mountain and weve taken the first firm steps we may not reach the summit in our lifetimes but men and women of good will a century from today will look back on this movement and say i wish i had been a part of them they had the courage to fight the will to win the sought goodness and they did good
4948109 easter is when jesus died and was buried in the tomb and then on the third day the stone was rolled away and he walked out and if he saw his shadow there would be three more weeks of winter
4948110 if we found the body could we call off easter
4948111 camelot lives camelot lives in each of you dont surrender its dream
4948112 master while you were away your wife received a large box big enough to hold a man she had it delivered to her chambers i have asked her to let me see what is in the box and she refuses
4948113 then will you tell me what is in the box
4948114 what then my beloved are we to do with this box which has come between us when we vowed to hold no secrets
4948115 there are no accidents there is only cause and effect the cause may be far away but the effect comes around
4948116 emergency service people were putting a woman on a stretcher they were tender attentive capable she was being taken care of traffic was being directed competently around the wreck it would be cleaned up hauled away taken care of a fire truck was parked beside the ambulance its chunky lights flashing standing by just in case a fire happened so they could take care of it this was one well taken care of situation i wanted to be on that stretcher i wanted capable people to take care of everything it looked restful i was tired i was the kind of tired you get at the end of a month long project i was the kind of tired you get when you have ten different people feeling in their heart that you should have done it differently their way the kind of tired you get when your house is messy your grass is too long your car is cluttered and your gas tank is empty along with your bank account a tiny piece of me thought it would be restful to lie down on clean sheets be fussed over in a clean hospital room have people bring jell o chicken broth and straws that bend usually i think its a good day when i dont have to take a ride in an ambulance and i get back to that state of mind pretty fast i talked to a friend of mine who used to work in an emergency room and she said what happens when you come in is that fast moving people with big scissors cut off all your clothes that didnt sound restful at all she suggested that i pay for a day at the spa where helpful calm people would fuss over me all day long id rest but no one would have to cut off my clothes with scissors i would be cheaper than a hospital stay and i could come home afterward
4948117 if realizations most often come from accidents perhaps we need to be a bit more accident prone
4948118 what if a king had sent you into a country to do one task but you did one hundred other tasks trying hard to remember the one you missed

4948135 the flexibility in the materials that we can work with and the size give us the ability to work with materials that are traditionally difficult to pattern low temperature non vacuum compatible or flexible substrates
4948136 all the results that weve shown have been performed in an office environment and on an optical bench without any vibration control in the context of the air force this has the implication that it could be possible to implement our technique to make repairs and modifications to materials in the field and even in a moving aircraft
4948137 we use optical tweezers and a high power pulsed ultraviolet laser as a result we can manipulate the beads all over the surface and can fire the pulsed laser in the locations we want to modify beneath the bead importantly we can perform parallel nanopatterning on all kinds of surfaces
4948138 this research grew out of our laser direct write work that howard has been funding for a few years he allowed us to explore this nanopatterning avenue with much success and we are very grateful for the resources and insight he provided which helped to make this research possible
4948139 estamos entrando tarde a los partidos siempre a remolque tenemos que arreglar esto en poco tiempo porque ante francia fuimos un desastre en ataque

4948144 theres not much to say for me life will go on
4948145 it also helps keep wages in check as employers have a bigger pool of qualified workers from which to choose

4948147 films fall into the broad category of event management and hence like any other event it can also be insured
4948148 these corporates prefer to be insured against any unforeseen or unfortunate incidents and this is becoming a big driver of growth
4948149 as film insurance gains in popularity it will also encourage and promote institutional financing of film making
4948150 las muchachas conoc an al rival y han podido centrarse en el partido sin distraerse con otras cuestiones hemos hecho un buen voleibol y hemos perdido ante un gran equipo como es cuba
4948151 estos juegos han sido una escuela para nosotros somos la selecci n m s joven que ha participado y muchas de nuestras jugadoras no llegan a los 18 a os ni han jugado nunca competici n de este alto nivel
4948152 vinimos con la expectativa de no quedar en el ltimo lugar y de practicar el mejor voleibol posible am n de adquirir experiencia cumplimos aunque creo que nos merecimos si no ganar un partido s al menos haber hecho un set a todas las selecciones con las que nos enfrentamos la diferencia no fue tan grande como se al el marcador

4948155 she didnt want to attend school here she wanted to attend school with her adopted sister

4948157 she loved taking care of children she liked babies she was baby sitting a lot she loved little children
4948158 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
4948159 educating the public on economic issues with a pro market pro paycheck message
4948160 id welcome money from any source that we can get to fight this
4948161 were begging for money for this fight whereas the other side is getting money from giant foreign conglomerates
4948162 i just mentioned it in passing thinking they had a lot bigger fish to fry
4948163 theyve spent a lot of money in the horse business

4948165 the government will not charge allens son mark allen or other family members of allen with any criminal offense arising out of the governments investigation or that have been disclosed to the government
4948166 he put it in there that was in the plea agreement but i dont know that his kids were really in any jeopardy
4948167 he took a pretty big haircut because of all of this
4948168 whatever people think of the events of 2006 the fact is that allen built the company going from nothing to a company that was doing a billion worth of business and then he had to sell at a fire sale price because of all the trouble he got in

4948175 nobody knew how this mechanism worked before we described this protein
4948176 this protein directly affects photosynthesis and how plants create biomass stems leaves and stalks and oils
4948177 i couldnt be more satisfied and i was proud of my performance here
4948178 i would have become the prime minister if i wished to become president
4948179 wir sind auch im nassen konkurrenzf hig aber ich bevorzuge ein trockenes rennen dann k nnen wir besser gegeneinander k mpfen
4948180 ich hatte ein paar probleme mit dem bike aber wir haben uns seit dem training sehr verbessert ich hatte mehr grip und eine bessere beschleunigung
4948181 gleichzeitig bin ich zuversichtlich dass es noch besser gehen kann
4948182 insgesamt f hlt sich das motorrad aber gut an wir sind vielleicht etwas zur ck aber nicht so weit
4948183 we have placed a greater emphasis on accelerated growth in the gulf cooperative council gcc countries to address the booming infrastructure market we have formed joint ventures and set up execution centres in various gcc countries
4948184 we have set up design engineering centres at sharjah and abu dhabi for providing design and engineering consultancy services in the oil and gas and infrastructure sectors
4948185 wir hatten die chance beide fahrer weiter vorne zu platzieren aber wir haben die besten bedingungen verpasst
4948186 ich kam herein und lie etwas ndern was ziemlich lange dauerte
4948187 als ich wieder raus ging waren die bedingungen so schlecht dass ich direkt wieder rein kam
4948188 deshalb habe ich die zeit verpasst als die strecke am schnellsten war
4948189 am ende habe ich einen neuen hinterreifen ausprobiert aber das hat nicht funktioniert
4948190 das ist nicht so schlecht mal sehen was ich im rennen erreichen kann denn egal ob es trocken oder nass wird wir werden konkurrenzf hig sein
4948191 alle hoffen auf ein trockenes rennen und unsere gestrige performance gibt uns daf r gute hoffnungen dann sollten beide fahrer die chance haben um einen podestplatz zu fahren
4948192 trotz des wassers auf der strecke sp rte ich das limit sehr gut
4948193 ich habe sofort meinen rhythmus gefunden und gemerkt dass es schneller ging als gestern von runde zu runde konnte ich immer noch einen drauf setzen
4948194 jedoch soll es morgen trocken sein und so werden die karten neu gemischt
4948195 wir k nnen auf die erfahrungen vom ersten freien training zur ckgreifen zudem konnte ich mein jetziges motorrad bereits nach dem grand prix im letzten jahr testen ich hoffe dass hilft uns etwas weiter
4948196 es war schnell klar dass wir nicht auf die zeiten von gestern kommen w rden
4948197 die strecke war weder ganz nass noch ganz trocken zudem war es sehr sehr kalt und windig
4948198 wegen des schlechten wetters konnten wir nicht das geplante testprogramm absolvieren so landeten wir im qualifying auf einer position von der aus wir k mpfen m ssen um ein ergebnis einzufahren welches unser potenzial widerspiegelt
4948199 deshalb haben wir eher aufgeh rt weil wir kein unn tiges risiko eingehen wollten
4948200 schlie lich gab es keine m glichkeit sich zu verbessern
4948201 ich bin wirklich gl cklich mit diesem resultat ich habe schon lange auf ein nasses qualifying gewartet
4948202 wir haben heute wirklich gut gearbeitet und waren den ganzen tag schon schnell durch ein paar ver nderungen am setup konnten wir uns dann noch weiter verbessern das gab mir selbstvertrauen und so war ich in der lage zu zeigen dass ich auch auf nasser strecke sehr schnell sein kann
4948203 wir haben einfach das richtige gef hl f r die front gefunden auf jeden fall wird es sehr wichtig einen guten start zu haben um sicher zu gehen dass ich keine positionen verliere und ein gutes rennen haben werde
4948204 wir haben ein paar nderungen am motorrad vorgenommen und das gef hl mit den reifen verbesserte sich dann am nachmittag sehr
4948205 gegen ende war es dann aber unm glich noch schneller zu fahren schlussendlich habe ich die zweite reihe verloren aber f hle mich deswegen nicht wirklich schlecht
4948206 f r mich ist es so nat rlich viel besser
4948207 es ist doch so michelin ist vielleicht auf einigen strecken auf dem gleichen level wie bridgestone vielleicht sind sie auf einigen strecken sogar etwas besser aber letztlich w re ein einheitsreifen das beste f r alle f r die show f r die fahrer f r alles
4948208 ich war schon in ihrer lage und wei dass es eine sehr schwierige situation ist
4948209 pedrosa ist es zum beispiel gewohnt um den sieg zu fahren er wei dass er das potenzial dazu hat und honda hat ein bike um weltmeister zu werden wenn man dann um platz 11 k mpft ist das f r den fahrer sehr schwierig
4948210 dann alles zu geben ans maximum zu gehen ist nicht einfach
4948211 mit ihrem budget und ihrem technischen wissen kann ich nicht verstehen warum wir so weit zur ck sind es ist besch mend f r sie und sie sollten es als wachruf ansehen es ist sicher ihre letzte chance
4948212 das ende der session war ok aber wir hatten am anfang leichte technische probleme danach war das gef hl aber ganz gut und ich konnte meine beste rundenzeit in der letzten runde fahren als die strecke sehr feucht war das gef hl war ok es ist nur schade dass wir technische probleme hatten
4948213 wir hatten uns am morgen stark verbessert am nachmittag haben wir aber nicht die richtige zeit erwischt um schnell zu sein ich habe bis zum ende gewartet und da war die strecke echt schwierig was es auch f r uns schwer gemacht hat jetzt muss ich halt weit hinten von 13 starten
4948214 deswegen haben wir die sicherheit an den strecken stark verbessert dar ber haben wir im meeting der sicherheitskommission am freitag gesprochen weil dieses thema jedoch von gr ter wichtigkeit ist haben wir uns dazu entschlossen es noch einmal mit allen fahrern zu diskutieren
4948215 ich bin sehr gl cklich mit dem resultat wir haben etwas risikiert und es war genau richtig so
4948216 der heutige tag war nur ein kleiner prozentsatz des ganzen wochenendes aber ich bin wirklich gl cklich nicht nur f r mich sondern auch f r kawasaki die mannschaft hat das motorrad wesentlich verbessert seit ich es zum letzten mal in assen gefahren bin
4948217 unser ziel ist eine top 5 platzierung denn ich will realistisch bleiben

4948219 en frica la paciencia no es una virtud sino una necesidad
4948220 the performance in the first half can be explained by the setbacks we have suffered in the last week
4948221 the loss of grafite the injury to dzeko and the defeat to palermo made the team a little unsure but in the second half we started to put on the pressure and played well
4948222 overall im pleased and happy to have started the season better than we did last year
4948223 the first half was not good we were much better in the second half and equalised early on which gave us a boost
4948224 that was the first small step but if you want to be near the top of the table you have to win games like that with my goal i first looked up to the middle and saw no one to pass to then i just speculated that mondragon would guess wrongly and simply fired in
4948225 esperamos ganar el lunes s o s porque es fundamental no pensamos con qui n podemos cruzar porque queda este partido nuestra sensaci n ahora es muy distinta despu s de ganar a alemania realmente no se qu cambi pero sali algo que no hab a salido
4948226 jollyari un bravo ragazzo spero che alla solbiatese capisca meglio le regole di questo sport mi ricordo quella partita dove ha preso la palla con le mani e ha gridato touchdown
4948227 sono contento di giocare qui mi sembra gi di aver trovato la mia squadra
4948228 i promettenti risultati delle prime tre amichevoli mi fanno ben sperare per il campionato lo so sar dura ma con jollyari in difesa mi sento molto sicuro speriamo che finisca di leggere il capitolo sul fuorigioco del suo manuale prima di settembre

4948230 ich hoffe dass wir morgen gut in form sein werden egal ob es trocken oder nass ist
4948231 nat rlich hoffe ich wie alle anderen auch dass es morgen trocken wird denn die verh ltnisse waren heute wirklich grauenhaft nach zwanzig minuten war es heute nachmittag unm glich die rundenzeiten geschweige denn das setup zu ver ndern
4948232 ich bin wirklich froh dass ich gleich am anfang ein paar gute runden fahren konnte ich denke dass ich im trockenen hier konkurrenzf higer bin
4948233 das war ein richtig schlechter tag am beginn des qualifyings war es noch trockener und genau da war ich mit dem motorrad in der box um noch ein paar dinge zu ver ndern
4948234 ich habe meine chance verpasst und genau zu der zeit fuhren die anderen ihre schnellsten rundenzeiten der fehler liegt aber nicht nur an mir
4948235 the prime minister did not speak during our brief tribute certainly not i dont think he even looked up the snarling business of question period having just ended he was shuffling papers i tried to bring him close to me with my eyes who is this man what makes him tick no doubt he is busy no doubt he is deluded by that busyness no doubt being prime minister fills his entire consideration and froths his sense of busied importance to the very brim and no doubt he sounds and governs like one who cares little for the arts but he must have moments of stillness and so this is what i propose to do not to educate that would be arrogant less than that to make suggestions to his stillness for as long as stephen harper is prime minister of canada i vow to send him every two weeks mailed on a monday a book that has been known to expand stillness that book will be inscribed and will be accompanied by a letter i will have written i will faithfully report on every new book every inscription every letter and any response i might get from the prime minister on this website
4948236 because he had not enough dead men to his credit
4948237 we took ten minutes to find our feet as began a little nervously from there though we had the game where we wanted it and were never really troubled
4948238 the second goal came at just the right time as cottbus were forced to do more ibisevic had a superb game this win gives us confidence and self belief for the coming weeks
4948239 it was great we wanted to win but knew that it would be difficult to win away from home in your first bundesliga game is something special

4948241 a sudden and drastic reduction in the availability of credit
4948242 lower energy prices if sustained should begin to help cool inflation fears inflation lags economic growth by several quarters and the economy continues to slow inflation fears should gradually recede

4948244 tomorrow is going to be wonderful because tonight i do not understand anything
4948245 very frankly i cant come to a firm conclusion as to whether were dealing with a bull or a bear market sometimes you just have to wait and allow the market to tell its story remember we may be in a hurry but the market never is
4948246 global businesses are very nervous they are more upbeat than they were in the spring but confidence is low and is fragile
4948247 tax rebate dollars supported economic growth in the us in the second quarter by the next fomc meeting on september 16 the fomc will have another months data for inflation employment and retail sales employment and retail sales should continue to show weakness and headline inflation will likely be considerably lower therefore the fed is firmly on hold
4948248 this commodities sell off which began in july and has continued into august also corresponds to the long term seasonal cycle in which prices for many commodities tend to bottom out in late summer before rebounding in the fall
4948249 a global recession is widely expected by fund managers as the credit crunch marks its first anniversary by mutating from a financial crisis into a world economic downturn according to merrill lynch
4948250 almost one quarter of the fund managers questioned by merrill in august for its monthly survey said the global economy was already in recession and almost half expect the world economy to contract over the next 12 months
4948251 however inflation fears are fading after the recent fall in oil prices
4948252 in an extraordinary reversal a net 18 of the surveys respondents said they expected global core inflation to fall over the next 12 months two months ago a net 33 thought inflation would rise
4948253 fears about stagflation are starting to give way to fears that the global economy is in for a period of below trend growth and below trend inflation said david bowers of absolute strategy research and independent consultant to merrills fund managers surveys
4948254 mr bowers said it was crystal clear that fund managers did not believe analysts profit forecasts with a net 83 describing earnings estimates for the coming year as too high
4948255 but as the economic downturn spreads to europe and japan enthusiasm for us assets has been rediscovered by fund managers with 53 expecting the dollar to appreciate and 38 planning to overweight us equities over the next twelve months both readings are record highs
4948256 the fall in oil prices has prompted a partial unwinding of the highly popular long energy short financials trade
4948257 among european fund managers the net overweight position in the oil and gas sector has fallen sharply from 62 in june to 11 in august meanwhile the net underweight in banks has shrunk from 62 in june to 40
4948258 it would be a serious mistake for the international community to regard the dramatic escalation of violence in georgia as just another flare up in the caucasus
4948259 the names of the flashpoints may be unfamiliar the territory remote and the dispute parochial but the battle under way will have important repercussions beyond the region
4948260 the outcome of the struggle will determine the course of russias relations with its neighbours will shape dmitri medvedevs presidency could alter the relationship between the kremlin and the west and crucially could decide the fate of caspian basin energy supplies
4948261 it was known that a serious confrontation had been building up british intelligence predicted this year that a war in the caucasus was probable the focus was georgia the wests main ally in the region and the only export route for caspian oil and gas outside kremlin control
4948262 part of the responsibility must lie with president saakashvili the us educated geogian leader has rightly been praised for turning around his countrys dire economy transforming the soviet style army into a modern western force and standing up to the kremlin
4948263 on paper the small georgian military is no match for the might of russia but mr saakashvili has calculated that his friends in the west notably america and britain will protect him
4948264 russia has made clear in word and deed that it will do anything to prevent natos expansion on its western and southern flanks
4948265 america and britain are closely involved in providing military assistance to the georgians in the form of arms and training the support is aimed at encouraging the rise of georgia as an independent sovereign state
4948266 but the help is also partly a means of protecting the oil pipeline across georgia that carries crude from the caspian to the black sea the only export route that bypasses russias stranglehold on energy exports from the region
4948267 in short washington has responded to this financial crisis with a politically driven reactive approach policy initiatives have been framed more by the circumstances of the moment than by a strategic assessment of what it truly takes to put the us economy back on a more sustainable path
4948268 by perpetuating excess consumption low saving unrealistic goals of home ownership and moral hazards in financial markets this patchwork approach has the biggest flaw of all it does little to change bad behavior
4948269 if this crisis is anything it is a wake up call
4948270 the longer the united states sustained the unsustainable the more it believed in the perpetuity of its charmed existence
4948271 the fed has lowered the federal funds rate 325 basis points since september and set up various programs to support fragile financial markets according to the senior loan officer opinion survey despite these endeavors the credit crunch remains in place for the most part
4948272 the details of the survey show that the housing market which was the trigger for the current financial market crisis is unlikely to stage a rebound in the near term
4948273 on the business side the fraction of banks indicating they had tightened lending standards for small firms hit a new high see chart 6 at 65 3 while the percentage of banks reporting tighter conditions for large firms rose to 57 6 from 55 4 in the april survey
4948274 the logic of the credit squeeze is inexorable the latest data from banks and prices in the secondary credit market point to a much slower economy
4948275 the federal reserves survey of us banks senior lending officers came out with little fanfare this week
4948276 lending officers said they were continuing to tighten standards whether on credit cards prime mortgages consumer or business loans even though a strong majority of banks had done this in the second quarter that implies a squeeze on consumption and lower investment as the year goes on
4948277 a similar exercise by the european central bank polling lenders in the eurozone seemed a little less gloomy but only on the surface
4948278 with banks planning to lend less and charge more for loans this makes sense it will be harder for companies to avoid default
4948279 the july headline and core inflation numbers were higher than expected however lower energy prices if sustained should begin to help cool inflation fears in addition core inflation will turn lower because the economy remains weak and companies are failing to pass through higher input costs
4948280 we have highlighted several times before that core cpi is likely at a cyclical peak inflation lags economic growth by several quarters and the economy continues to slow
4948281 the cpis rapid ascent in the past three months undoubtedly remains near the top of the list of concerns of the fomc
4948282 weve recently seen the greatest expansion of credit in history
4948283 the us and the economies of the free world run on credit
4948284 with credit being restricted a second and very serious danger surfaces that danger is asset deflation the very thought of asset deflation sends chills of fear up fed chief ben bernankes spine credit contraction asset deflation shades of the great depression
4948285 it will take a much deeper correction in oil prices some light at the end of the housing tunnel and a stabilization of employment trends to reverse the us consumer retrenchment
4948286 retail sales growth slowed in july led by dismal sales at auto dealers
4948287 the chart below shows the year on year growth rate for us gdp over the past 40 years along with the contribution from net exports in goods and services
4948288 delinquency rates on single family mortgages have reached their highest level on record the fed started tracking this statistic in 1991 dragging up the delinquency rate on all loans held by us banks
4948289 prime mortgages are starting to default at disturbingly high rates a development that threatens to slow any potential housing recovery
4948290 the delinquency rate for prime mortgages worth less than 417 000 was 2 44 in may compared with 1 38 a year earlier according to loanperformance
4948291 delinquencies jumped even more for prime loans of more than 417 000 so called jumbo loans they rose to 4 03 of outstanding loans in may compared with 1 11 a year earlier
4948292 and prime loans issued in 2007 are performing the worst of all failing at a rate nearly triple that of prime loans issued in 2006 according to loanperformance
4948293 the extent of how bad these loans are doing is very troubling said pat newport real estate economist with global insight a forecasting firm
4948294 prime loans are just the latest class of mortgages to suffer a spike in failure rates
4948295 banks losses from the us subprime crisis and the ensuing credit crunch crossed the 500 billion mark as writedowns spread to more asset types
4948296 the writedowns and credit losses at more than 100 of the worlds biggest banks and securities firms rose after ubs reported second quarter earnings today which included 6 billion of charges on subprime related assets
4948297 the international monetary fund in an april report estimated banks losses at 510 billion about half its forecast of 1 trillion for all companies predictions have crept up since then with new york university economist nouriel roubini predicting losses to reach 2 trillion
4948298 us stocks pulled ahead of brazil russia india and china this week for the first time in 2008 spurred by the federal reserves efforts to cut borrowing costs even as the biggest developing countries are raising theirs
4948299 the bombay stock exchanges sensex index dropped 25 in 2008 through yesterday chinas csi 300 index decreased 54 and russias benchmark rts index fell 21 brazils bovespa has lost 15 this year
4948300 the fashionable investment tactic of the past month buying bank stocks while selling energy companies could already have gone too far merrill lynch warned clients yesterday
4948301 in mid july hedge funds pension funds and other institutional investors dramatically reversed their enthusiasm for energy stocks and loathing for financials in an abrupt about turn that sent bank shares soaring and oil and gas companies sinking
4948302 but merrill said yesterday that the unwinding of the classic bet of the credit crunch may already have been overdone giving warning that banks across europe could still be forced to raise between 70 billion and 120 billion in new equity on top of the 120 billion already raised
4948303 what will be the likely impact on equity markets if the dominant global themes of the first six months of the year rising commodity prices inflation and interest rate fears and a weakening dollar continue to unravel in the second half
4948304 robert parkes equity strategist at hsbc says there has been a clear reversal in global sector performance between the first half of 2008 and the period from july 1 to date
4948305 the top five performers in the first half oil services industrial metals mining oil producers and chemicals have been the five worst in the second half
4948306 away from the likely path of commodity prices inflation interest rates and the dollar a theme likely to remain prominent is concern about the global growth outlook he says
4948307 it may be too early to get involved in cyclical sectors particularly on the consumer side
4948308 for eurozone companies with dollar exposure the negative impact from the exchange rate on earnings growth is likely to remain prominent in the third quarter before it fades in the fourth quarter and then turns positive as we move into 2009
4948309 for uk companies with dollar exposure the currency is likely to boost earnings growth in each of the next four quarters
4948310 since the s amp p 500 peaked on october 9th the index is down 17
4948311 after selling off 9 4 in the last two days of trading and 60 since its peak last october 16th the shanghai composite is now back to december 2006 levels i e below 2500
4948312 so today with oil and other commodity prices in determined decline shouldnt chinese equities be catching a break
4948313 russian equities have been excessively punished over the last couple of weeks and even allowing for a higher risk premium and more normal oil prices valuations look compelling says vladimir savov strategist at credit suisse
4948314 he notes the market has fallen to levels last seen in november 2006 but says there are material differences in the economy and valuations since then
4948315 russian gdp in 2006 was 986 billion compared to our expectation for 2008 of 1 644 billion he says
4948316 mr savov says investors have taken too conservative a view on russian market risk
4948317 goldman sachs group reversed course on its dollar forecast saying the greenback has bottomed as global growth weakens oil prices decline and the us trade balance improves
4948318 the us currency after reaching a 5 1 2 month high of 1
4948319 the dollar has gained 7 6 percent versus the euro since touching a record low in july as traders reduced bets that the european central bank will raise interest rates and crude oil tumbled
4948320 after over levered dollar shorts euro longs cover those positions much of the world will realize that the exploding us budget deficit and further financial system problems make the dollar an unattractive haven
4948321 with international tensions reaching a new level of intensity and the global financial system still under historic duress wed guess that the dollar rally could continue but it is a temporary technical reaction
4948322 for investors in precious metals this has been a harrowing time where portfolios have taken a beating
4948323 platinums upside acceleration was a warning that we were on the cusp of a medium term correction however the faster downward acceleration this week also indicates that we are swiftly approaching the lows for this reaction at fullermoney we continue to believe that precious metals are in a long term secular uptrend but given the technical deterioration investors will have to be patient before these metals can justify significantly higher levels however for investors unwilling to wait out the correction this is probably a bad time to sell considering how overextended the market is right now patient more risk tolerant investors may consider nibbling around current levels or more prudently wait for a clear upward dynamic which will signal that at least a short term floor has been reached
4948324 a war breaks out in the caucasus pitting russia against a close ally of the united states inflation reaches a new peak in the euro zone the cpi reaches the highest in britain since bank of england independence rampant inflation sweeps the developing world
4948325 yet gold crashes it has failed to deliver on its core promises as a safe haven and inflation hedge at least for now why
4948326 gold has fallen from 1030 an ounce in february to 807 today in london trading it has collapsed through key layers of technical support triggering automatic stop loss sales the goldman sachs short position that i have been observing with some curiosity has paid off
4948327 for gold bugs the unthinkable has now happened the metal has fallen through its 50 week moving average the key support line that has held solid through the seven year bull market this week is not over yet of course if gold recovers enough in coming days it could still close above the line
4948328 well my own view is that gold bugs should start looking very closely at something else the implosion of europe japan is in recession too
4948329 my guess is that political protest will mark the next phase of this drama
4948330 what we are about to see is a race to the bottom by the worlds major currencies as each tries to devalue against others in a beggar thy neighbour policy to shore up exports or indeed simply because they have to cut rates frantically to stave off the consequences of debt deleveraging and the risk of an outright slump
4948331 when that happens if it is not already happening it will become clear that the pillars of the global monetary system are unstable infested with the dry rot of excess debt
4948332 gold should soon find support despite the setback in crude oil prices and a steadier dollar
4948333 historically precious metals are highly correlated with the dollar negatively and oil prices positively as the oil strength and dollar weakness of the past year unwind gold has faced downward pressure
4948334 however several factors suggest that gold should soon find support and begin to edge higher in both absolute terms and relative to oil
4948335 in addition gold etf demand is recovering after a brief pullback and our model indicates that the fair value of gold is in the low 900 ounce zone and rising
4948336 finally gold tends to be less sensitive to a global economic slowdown than industrial metals or energy
4948337 faced with slowing global growth macro investors began dumping commodities and commodity related stocks with small and mid cap stocks hurt the most
4948338 the unwinding of the long energy short financials trade also has been a big driver of recent share price performance
4948339 we remain optimistic about the long term picture for natural resources
4948340 on a positive note china announced last week that it was changing policy to increase loan quotas
4948341 the ifo economic climate in the euro area has worsened again in the third quarter of 2008 for the fourth time in succession
4948342 the economic climate has further clouded over in nearly all countries of the euro area in the third quarter of 2008
4948343 at 3 6 the inflation expectations exceed the ecb target even more so than at the beginning of the year 2 5 in contrast to the previous survey the wes experts anticipate an increase in key lending rates in the course of the come six months
4948344 inflation remains just as much a problem as ever with july inflation for the eurozone touching 4
4948345 the economy is now on the verge of recession the bank of england has warned for the first time in his gravest assessment yet governor mervyn king said the economy will start to shrink by the end of the year the first decline since the early 1990s
4948346 he warned that households face an extremely difficult year ahead as britain is hit by rising energy and oil prices and the worst financial crisis since the second world war
4948347 setting out a gloomy diagnosis of the problems facing families mr king also warned that
4948348 mr king slashed his forecast for the uks growth acknowledging that by the end of this year the economy will be shrinking rather than expanding
4948349 this last happened in 1992 when britain was in the midst of a major recession the governor added that a technical recession defined as the economy shrinking for two successive quarters was more than possible
4948350 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth he said oil prices are at the highest level in real terms at any point in the post war period apart from the late 1970s and weve also seen the biggest financial dislocation since the second world war
4948351 advanced economies received a wake up call on wednesday that none were immune to the effects of the credit crisis stalking financial sectors on both sides of the atlantic
4948352 in japan new data showed the worlds second largest economy contracted by 0 6 in the second quarter its worst quarterly performance for seven years
4948353 the quarterly decline makes japan the biggest economy yet to experience economic contraction this year
4948354 china is set to overtake the us next year as the worlds largest producer of manufactured goods four years earlier than expected as a result of the rapidly weakening us economy
4948355 the great leap is revealed in forecasts for the financial times by global insight a us economics consultancy according to the estimates next year china will account for 17 of manufacturing value added output of 11 783 billion and the us will make 16
4948356 last year the us was still easily in the top slot and accounted for a fifth of the total china was second with 13 2
4948357 john engler president of the national association of manufacturers a washington based trade group played down the effect of the projections
4948358 the expected change will end more than a 100 years of us dominance it returns china to a position it occupied according to economic historians for some 1 800 years up to about 1840 when britain became the worlds biggest manufacturer after its industrial revolution
4948359 chinas wholesale inflation in july accelerated to its highest rate in 12 years adding to the governments headaches as it tries to rein in surging consumer prices according to data reported monday
4948360 the producer price index was up 10 in july over the same month last year the highest rate since 1996 the xinhua news agency said citing the governments statistics bureau the index measures the price of goods as they leave the factory
4948361 analysts have warned that rising costs for energy and raw materials would push up chinese wholesale prices squeezing thin profit margins for companies and adding to pressure for retailers to raise consumer prices
4948362 indias inflation soared to a 16 year high and may accelerate further after the government approved wage increases for civil servants
4948363 wholesale prices rose 12 44 in the week to august 2 after increasing 12 01 in the previous week the commerce ministry said in new delhi today economists were expecting a 12 2 gain
4948364 prime minister manmohan singhs cabinet today approved an average 21 salary increase for about 5 million government employees that may give the central bank little choice other than to raise interest rates again after three increases since june economists said

4948370 wassermangel ist eines der dr ngenden probleme unserer zeit und nicht nur eine frage des reinen vorhandenseins der ressource sondern auch des zugangs und der nutzung wir brauchen ein weltweites international koordiniertes wassermanagement
4948371 generell gilt wasserverbrauch ist nichts schlechtes sondern ein ganz nat rlicher vorgang wenn jedoch w hrend einer d rre noch wasser abgezweigt und verschwendet wird und dann die fischer stromabw rts ihre lebensgrundlage verlieren ist das nicht in ordnung es kommt also drauf an wann wo und wie viel wasser aus der natur entnommen wird
4948372 die deutschen haben beim direkten pro kopf verbrauch einen sehr guten durchschnittswert z hlt man jedoch das virtuelle wasser hinzu schnellt der fu abdruck eines jeden b rgers dramatisch nach oben
4948373 wir haben die verantwortung bei dem import von produkten auf deren wasserverbrauch bei der herstellung zu achten
4948374 es liegt an den unternehmen bei der herstellung von produkten auf einen nachhaltigen und umweltschonenden wasserverbrauch zu achten
4948375 regierungen sollen mit gutem beispiel vorangehen und einen politikrahmen f r verantwortungsvollen umgang mit wasser setzen
4948376 sicher es gibt angenehmeres aber andere leute k nnen auch nicht zu arbeiten aufh ren nur weil sie sich gerade trennen
4948377 ich kann nur sagen was ich in solchen f llen mache ich st rze mich in sport das lenkt von problemen ab und befreit den kopf
4948378 ich musste sehr viel laufen mein trainer david kirsch hat mit mir zusammen einen bungsplan ausgearbeitet der sah mindestens viermal sechs kilometer lauftraining pro woche vor morgens um sechs nach 30 minuten stretching meist gabs dann noch eine nachmittags session dazu musste ich zum krafttraining ins studio curls mit kleinen hanteln immer zehn wiederholungen bauchmuskeltraining mindestens 20 klappmesser danach trizeps bungen

4948390 we knew they would come back but we put the work in early so we could hold on at the finish

4948393 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
4948394 its not something we have looked at in the past its an opportunity to attract people who have the flexibility to move around sa
4948395 they can follow the harvest around the state most of our sites are close to caravan parks so people can travel around and make some money at the same time
4948396 it also gives them a chance to become part of the community its a good way to meet people
4948397 it is extremely hard to get staff especially seasonal staff
4948398 with the grey nomads you dont get people coming to work with hangovers and you dont have to hammer a good work ethic into them
4948399 they might also have some experience there are a lot of ex farmers or semi retired farmers on the road and country towns welcome people with open arms
4948400 it can be hot and dusty but you meet a variety of people from different parts of the state all different characters
4948401 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4948402 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4948403 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4948404 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4948405 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4948406 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4948407 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4948408 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4948409 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4948410 for me it is not a problem and im not going to worry about it because he is going to be our player it is not a concern
4948411 at no point has robinho given the impression that he does not want to go
4948412 he is very well i have spoken with him and the player is in perfect shape
4948413 i dont read headlines on the day of the game but my commitment is 100 per cent with the fans with the players and with the club in general
4948414 i say 100 times my family is happy here we want to win trophies at this club because it is a massive club
4948415 if we have problems because we are not doing things which in my opinion as a manager we could do i will work as hard as i can for the club
4948416 i will not talk about any player but in april i was talking about this barry
4948417 we tried to do things in confidentiality but sometimes you cannot and you need to explain before the end of the transfer window
4948418 if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money then we have to make the right decisions in terms of whom we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager
4948419 i was in contact with tom hicks and he told me we had the money we have sold players for more than 20million in the summer and he told me if you sell players you can buy with that too
4948420 i have the support of at least one of the owners i sent emails to all of them but he hicks was clear we had the money

4948423 there are two prevailing theories to explain this one is that single sex schools are indeed better at providing kids with a positive sense of themselves as students to compete with the antiacademic influences of youth culture the other is that in order to end up in a single sex classroom you need to have a parent who has made what educators call

4948425 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4948426 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4948427 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4948428 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4948429 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4948430 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4948431 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4948432 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4948433 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4948434 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4948435 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4948436 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4948437 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4948438 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4948439 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4948440 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4948441 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4948442 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4948443 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4948444 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4948445 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4948446 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4948447 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4948448 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4948449 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4948450 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4948451 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4948452 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4948453 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4948454 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4948455 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4948456 se les debe prohibir que tengan poder informativo si son industriales que inviertan en industrias no en hacer diarios si son banqueros que se dediquen a las finanzas y no a poner canales de televisi n eso es muy sano para la sociedad
4948457 toda persona tiene derecho a generar procesar o difundir informaci n
4948458 el empleo de los medios de comunicaci n es de inter s p blico
4948459 se le acab la concesi n y el due o del espectro que es el estado decidi no renovar esa concesi n
4948460 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4948461 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4948462 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4948463 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4948464 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4948465 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4948466 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4948467 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4948468 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4948469 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4948470 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4948471 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4948472 hat man gesp rt dass die vp nicht will und sie hat das jetzt eineinhalb jahre zelebriert
4948473 jetzt auf einmal wo es neuwahlen gibt ist sie wach geworden oder auch panisch
4948474 wenn sie arbeitsf hig ist wenn jemand mit dem ressentiment in eine koalition geht ich will nur zerst rerisch wirken dann ist es besser derjenige geht in die opposition
4948475 personen und pers nlichkeiten wenn der anstand wieder etwas weiter oben gereiht wird dann funktioniert es vielleicht
4948476 das tut seiner familie weh und meiner auch aber wir lieben uns einfach

4948479 i just cant figure out how come they gave victory to kumar after vodopyanov had scored a clear win and was all over the indian boxer right before the bell rang
4948480 whoever lost this game would probably cross over and see america as everybody here already knows america being who they are there was a lot riding on this game
4948481 you dont want to cross over with the united states until the gold medal we were both trying to avoid meeting them too early
4948482 they started hard hedging and trapping and rotating and unfortunately we didnt do a very good job of keeping floor space
4948483 weve been fighting and scratching and biting and punching to get back
4948484 for us to be good enough to win the gold we have to put together 40 minutes
4948485 from where i sit if any other team in this tournament has a crack at the u s and can beat them im sure it can be the russians theyve already done it
4948486 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4948487 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4948488 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4948489 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4948490 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4948491 no vas a venir a decirme a m qu hacer en mi pa s
4948492 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4948493 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4948494 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4948495 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4948496 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4948497 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4948498 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
4948499 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it

4948502 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4948503 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4948504 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation
4948505 equally citizens are entitled to expect reasonable behaviour from our police so lets wait and see before we jump to any conclusions
4948506 which just underscores the fact that our funding costs were higher than what we actually recovered
4948507 were a few basis points behind at this point so obviously were looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4948508 its going to be an interesting situation to see exactly where our funding position is at that point
4948509 i think its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
4948510 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down
4948511 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4948512 so in the longer term if those rates continue to come down then the banks should be passing on those benefits as well when it comes to their unofficial cash rate rises that occurred over the last few months
4948513 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

4948515 after what happened its unlikely ossetians and abkhazians will ever be able to live together with georgia in one state
4948516 this is not a done deal we need to do our utmost to deter such behavior in the future
4948517 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4948518 its quiet there but now there are problems with food
4948519 were in a difficult situation but our government is helping us
4948520 you know i am very ashamed we dont have a kopeck left and im so hungry
4948521 all these agreements are agreed only to be broken later we should not trust them for one minute
4948522 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4948523 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4948524 if someone continues to attack our citizens our peacekeepers then of course we will answer just as we did
4948525 russia as guarantor of security in the caucasus and the region will make the decision which unambiguously supports the will of these two caucasus peoples
4948526 unfortunately today we are looking evil directly in the eye and today this evil is very dangerous for everybody not only for us
4948527 we told the world this is about starting an invasion we screamed to the world stop it
4948528 and the definition of an international mechanism which will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the agreement on the ground
4948529 resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4948530 this is no longer 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia when a great power invaded a small neighbor and overthrew its government
4948531 unfortunately after what has happened it is unlikely that the ossetians and the abkhazians will be able to live in one state together with the georgians
4948532 with its actions in recent days russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
4948533 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4948534 we saw that many of the reactions of the russian army in georgian territory are exceeding the boundaries of international law
4948535 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

4948537 its already been examined by the accc australian competition and consumer commission but i have to take advice from apra australian prudential regulation authority and i have to take into account national interest considerations
4948538 i accept that i have a decision to take because its market sensitive i dont speculate about the outcome of that decision
4948539 but we have our eye on financial stability in the system as well as the competitive nature of the system when i take that decision about national interest considerations
4948540 we did that because of concerns about financial stability in the system not just in terms of competition
4948541 those same factors will apply when i take this decision in the national interest
4948542 its already been examined by the accc australian competition and consumer commission but i have to take advice from apra australian prudential regulation authority and i have to take into account national interest considerations

4948547 non sar una semplice reintroduzione dellici assicura il ministro per la semplificazione normativa ma preveder la soppressione delle oltre dieci tasse relative alla casa stato regione comune e la loro sostituzione con un tributo unico proprio a vantaggio dei comuni
4948548 garanzie e certezze circa il reintegro del mancato gettito dellici sulla prima casa e nella quale si torna palesemente a un sistema di trasferimenti erariali e di limitazione della autonomia fiscale e finanziaria delle amministrazioni locali
4948549 si pu ragionevolmente ipotizzare la facolt per i comuni che abbiano particolari esigenze di bilancio di imporre una tassa sugli immobili ma questa deve essere decisa in piena autonomia dai sindaci e non essere imposta dautorit dal governo centrale
4948550 non possiamo dimenticare che vista la situazione economica internazionale e del debito pubblico nellimmediato la detassazione degli straordinari e labolizione dellici sulla prima casa sono gli interventi che il governo ha potuto fare nei confronti della pressione fiscale solo quando sar decollato in tutti i suoi aspetti il federalismo fiscale mette in chiaro che dovr comprendere una compensazione tra regioni forti e quelle deboli si potr riesaminare la questione dellici
4948551 era un impegno della campagna elettorale di berlusconi sta nel programma di governo labbiamo realizzata e non ci torneremo sopra
4948552 stata stata sepolta e nessuno la resusciter il commento lapidario di dellesecutivo di alleanza nazionale e deputato pdl il governo berlusconi aveva promesso di abolirla nella sua prima riunione e cos stato
4948553 le sue parole sono vangelo rincara maurizio gasparri presidente dei senatori del pdl quella la linea e non c spazio per nessunaltra tesi in parlamento
4948554 lici sulla prima casa stata abolita sulla base di un preciso impegno elettorale e non c nessuno spazio per la sua reintroduzione
4948555 nel governo regna la confusione sottolinea coordinatore del governo ombra del pd da un lato col documento di programmazione economica lesecutivo berlusconi programma un aumento della pressione fiscale costante nei prossimi cinque anni dallaltro rivendica come grande conquista labolizione dellici sulla prima casa ma poi bossi e una parte consistente della maggioranza annunciano lintenzione di reintrodurre lici mi sembra che il governo stia andando avanti a tentoni tutto il contrario di quella coerenza di cui fa gran vanto tremonti
4948556 la proposta di bossi di reintrodurre lici dimostra che il governo in un forte stato confusionale ed ha un atteggiamento schizofrenico rileva il capogruppo dellidv alla camera questo dietrofront di bossi dimostra che il governo pensa pi a illudere i cittadini che a risolvere i problemi del paese
4948557 quella sullici una tempesta in un bicchiere dacqua anzi con poca acqua chiosa il portavoce di forza italia ragion per cui la sinistra farebbe bene a spegnere gli inutili fuochi della propaganda il centrodestra ha giustamente cancellato lici eliminando una tassa odiosa che riguardava l85 degli italiani e evidente che sarebbe autolesionistico reintrodurla
4948558 the good news is that our cropping sector is in a much better position than this time last year
4948559 however we really need good rain before the end of august
4948560 only the eastern third of nsw received reasonable rainfall in july and unfortunately this rainfall was just not widespread or significant enough to make a real dent in the ongoing dry conditions for much of regional nsw

4948591 the us senate has been pushing american technology companies to work with rights groups to develop a human rights code of conduct which would help to guide their overseas activities yahoo now claims that it has established the core components of a global code of conduct and a more complete version will be ready this fall however the industry standard notes that theres a fundamental flaw with such efforts us law is not world law following the local laws is a requirement of doing business in any country and conflicts between corporate ethics and the law of the land in which these corporations do business are inevitable the us senates push for such a code was prompted by a number of incidents including yahoos complicity in the arrest of chinese dissidents and a chinese journalist

4948635 saya tak percaya mereka mengalami masalah sebanyak itu mari jangan lupakan mereka kehilangan beberapa pemain yang cedera tapi saat dua tim besar berhadapan mereka selalu ingin tampil bagus
4948636 ini memang bukan partai liga tapi determinasinya tetap sama juga karena laga seperti ini membawa anda ke tingkat konsentrasi yang dibutuhkan untuk menghadapi partai resmi kami akan datang ke san siro dan mencoba menang itulah filosofi kami dan ada dalam dna kami
4948637 aku tak tahu apa yang harus dirasakan sangat banyak emosi sangat banyak kegembiraan aku hanya ingin melihat ibuku
4948638 ini sudah bak jadi perjalanan rollercoaster ke arah atas tapi tetap menyenangkan hal yang terbesar adalah tidak ada yang mustahil dengan teramat banyak orang yang bilang itu tidak mungkin dilakukan yang diperlukan hanyalah imajinasi

4948641 doing all best times winning every race everything was accomplished that i wanted to
4948642 this was not just for michael but for all of us
4948643 im lucky to have everything i have the talent the drive and the excitement about the sport
4948644 when i did that last half stroke i thought it cost me the race
4948645 it seems im in sort of a dream world sometimes you have to pinch yourself to see its real im just glad its real
4948646 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer had second
4948647 it was a real honor for me to race michael phelps and to have all eyes on me as the guy who could possibly do it
4948648 so im enjoying this moment i wish it was a gold medal but im happy with the silver
4948649 there hasnt been an error in the timing system i ever heard of
4948650 if you dream as big as you can dream anything is possible
4948651 i kept my eyes on michael but it was a race with myself
4948652 but for the circumstances i guess its not too bad
4948653 i wanted to try and get out into the open water i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
4948654 phelps swam so fast it is my honor to compete with him
4948655 i had to force myself to put it out of my head
4948656 the greatest relay swimmer of all time the last 50 meters were absolutely incredible
4948657 i was going to need a strong breaststroke when we all turned together at the wall then ryan turned dead even at the 200m so i knew i was going to have to overpower them
4948658 early in the count i was just looking to get a good pitch to hit and put some barrel on it and hit
4948659 we look at the work of others not because we want to copy it
4948660 but because we want to take away the best aspects of each gaming in indonesia design and apply them to our own work
4948661 the use of computers in our firm has accounted for a five fold increase in productivity quality and sales volume computers allow our gaming in indonesia design specialists a much a higher degree of efficieny and output furthermore since we can make more with less our overhead decreases dramatically and profits will skyrocket
4948662 i know there is no such thing as a quick buck but in 5 years when this gaming in indonesia industry blossoms were going to see a lot of new rich people
4948663 this means a lot to me personally weve worked so hard in this industry for years and finally it is starting to pay off big
4948664 because as interest and corporate demand for gaming in indonesia art grows so will the talent base were going to see some great work from some of the top up and coming names in the business
4948665 the key to working on good gaming in indonesia design pieces is patience and rote talent
4948666 like many of our employees i started with classical art training and drawing and slowly moved into the post modern area this succession greatly improved my gaming in indonesia art and drawing skills
4948667 the fact that most of todays up and coming designers have never used charcoal and a pad of paper doesnt bother me in the least
4948668 ive been a student of gaming in indonesia design for almost 20 years now
4948669 and i cant say ive ever been more excited than now our new director pancho marxen promises to bring things to a much higher level and increase our output i realize this will mean more gaming in indonesia design hours but this also means more money for all of us

4948677 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4948678 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4948679 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation
4948680 equally citizens are entitled to expect reasonable behaviour from our police so lets wait and see before we jump to any conclusions
4948681 the good news is that our cropping sector is in a much better position than this time last year
4948682 however we really need good rain before the end of august
4948683 only the eastern third of nsw received reasonable rainfall in july and unfortunately this rainfall was just not widespread or significant enough to make a real dent in the ongoing dry conditions for much of regional nsw
4948684 water availability in irrigated agriculture areas like the murray valley is extremely low this has a cumulative effect affecting prices from the farm gate to the checkout

4948696 its already been examined by the accc australian competition and consumer commission but i have to take advice from apra australian prudential regulation authority and i have to take into account national interest considerations
4948697 i accept that i have a decision to take because its market sensitive i dont speculate about the outcome of that decision
4948698 but we have our eye on financial stability in the system as well as the competitive nature of the system when i take that decision about national interest considerations
4948699 we did that because of concerns about financial stability in the system not just in terms of competition
4948700 those same factors will apply when i take this decision in the national interest
4948701 it amp squo s already been examined by the accc australian competition and consumer commission but i have to take advice from apra australian prudential regulation authority and i have to take into account national interest considerations
4948702 which just underscores the fact that our funding costs were higher than what we actually recovered
4948703 were a few basis points behind at this point so obviously were looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4948704 its going to be an interesting situation to see exactly where our funding position is at that point
4948705 i think its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
4948706 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down
4948707 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4948708 so in the longer term if those rates continue to come down then the banks should be passing on those benefits as well when it comes to their unofficial cash rate rises that occurred over the last few months

4948718 yeah i guess we all kind of are really though some of us are trying to do it right and even if we dont know how were doing everything we can to make you girls happy
4948719 so if its not enough for you then we understand because we never really had confidence in ourselves anyway but if it is enough for you then we feel like weve finally done something right and that is the best feeling in the world

4948761 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
4948762 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
4948763 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4948764 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4948765 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4948766 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
4948767 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
4948768 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
4948769 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
4948770 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4948771 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4948772 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4948773 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4948774 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4948775 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4948776 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4948777 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4948778 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4948779 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4948780 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4948781 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4948782 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4948783 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4948784 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4948785 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4948786 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4948787 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4949032 if hail hits an apple it doesnt necessarily mean the apple is destroyed
4949033 it just means that you cant sell it at the retail level

4949035 a total of 49 deaths corresponding to 1 18 percent mortality among the enrolled patients were recorded in the studies these include deaths both in the control and intervention groups as per the designs of individual studies

4949037 the unquestionable ease with which clinical trials can be conducted on human beings in india makes international agencies first test their products on the indian population
4949038 this prompted me to find out the details and the ethical procedures involved if any
4949039 the fact that of the 4 142 babies on whom clinical trials were conducted 2 728 were under one year of age is scary
4949040 children eligible for clinical studies conducted in department represents a mix of those attending the out patient and in patient services
4949041 no studies selectively target children belonging to low socio economic status sic the eligibility is based on the aims of respective studies

4949059 i just couldnt live on one healthy foot anymore let alone try to skate
4949060 weve tried everything to avoid surgery because we knew it would mean missing a chunk of the season but nothing worked
4949061 i need to perform better than i did and i know that is the expectation but ive always thought skating was the biggest part of my game and last season i couldnt skate like i can
4949062 obviously had we known surgery was inevitable we would have had it in june
4949063 ray was great about trying to treat this without surgery but nothing we tried worked
4949064 values go down and tax rates go up and everyone pays a little more and they arent happy
4949065 when values have gone down people have to understand there is a lag time and it doesnt reflect market value
4949066 the hurting is not as bad as in other communities
4949067 an average house in this town is probably assessed at slightly over 500 000 so youre talking about a 550 increase in taxes
4949068 i dont know about you but i think thats a lot to swallow
4949069 in an absolute sense it feels worse because houses went down in value
4949070 the combination of declining property value and increasing property tax creates anxiety for people
4949071 if drug cartels can ship up to 10 tons of cocaine in a semi submersible they can clearly ship or rent space to a terrorist organization for a weapon of mass destruction or a high profile terrorist
4949072 this is a more sophisticated way of getting the dope into the country

4949074 where the technology is going right now they most likely have to have some outside expertise
4949075 during the cold war the russians had hundreds of submarines and their submarine building has collapsed
4949076 there is already senior level contact between russian gangsters and colombian gangsters there are enough mobsters in russia to make the approach for the colombian drug organizations
4949077 they are able to carry their cargo readily at a fairly good speed and they are easily scuttled
4949078 they were the average joe now with semi submersible vessels and supply vessels at way points there is a much more elaborate transportation system than there used to be
4949079 they have created a far more sophisticated and from a security perspective potentially far more daunting maritime threat

4949097 itll cost me money to build it and cost me money to maintain it unless somebody needs a sidewalk or if somebody living on a street asks for it i dont see why it should be done
4949098 if the street is used as a connector street the streets proximity to schools parks business districts public and semipublic buildings and other places that attract pedestrian traffic the streets location with relation to existing and potential vehicular and pedestrian traffic and the need to connect areas with existing sidewalks to provide safe walkways for pedestrian traffic between parts of the city
4949099 when you live in a city and you happen to live on an unimproved street or an improved street without sidewalks its simply a matter that the city will catch up with you sooner or later

4949141 its already been examined by the accc australian competition and consumer commission but i have to take advice from apra australian prudential regulation authority and i have to take into account national interest considerations
4949142 i accept that i have a decision to take because its market sensitive i dont speculate about the outcome of that decision
4949143 but we have our eye on financial stability in the system as well as the competitive nature of the system when i take that decision about national interest considerations
4949144 we did that because of concerns about financial stability in the system not just in terms of competition same sex marriages

4949151 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4949152 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4949153 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4949154 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4949155 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4949156 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4949157 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4949158 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4949159 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4949160 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4949161 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4949162 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4949163 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4949164 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4949165 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4949166 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4949167 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4949168 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4949169 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4949170 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4949171 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4949172 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4949173 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them

4949175 geen joden meer nederland in veel joden nederland uit denaturalisatie van joodse criminelen
4949176 ik ontzeg niemand een gezinsleven ook joden niet ze mogen trouwen ze mogen samenwonen alleen niet in nederland
4949177 ik vind wel dat er minder joden moeten zijn in nederland
4949178 hun hypothetische afwezigheid binnen de nederlandse realiteit mag dan wel mijn utopia zijn maar is niet realistisch
4949179 iedere jood moet een assimilatiecontract tekenen daarin staat precies wat je wel en niet mag doen als je daar niet aan voldoet moet je het land verlaten
4949180 stuur joden die problemen veroorzaken het land uit met familie en al
4949181 veel fundamentele problemen in nederland zoals infrastructuur files huisvestingsproblemen en de verzorgingsstaat kun je rechtstreeks toeschrijven aan joden
4949182 verzoekt de regering criminele joden indien nodig na denaturalisatie het land uit te zetten
4949183 criminele joden zouden na het uitzitten van hun straf hun verblijfsvergunning kwijt moeten raken en het land moeten worden uitgezet
4949184 niet uit haat maar uit trots en zelfbehoud van onze nederlandse identiteit en onze westerse waarden verdedig ik een jodenstop
4949185 autochtonen planten zich minder snel voort dan joden nu zitten joden voornamelijk in de grote steden over twintig jaar zitten ze overal van apeldoorn tot emmen en van weert tot middelburg
4949186 ik zou niet graag willen dat een groeiend aantal mensen wellicht in de toekomst een meerderheid van de bevolking of van een kabinet uit joden bestaat
4949187 de god van de joden is een enge duivel die we in nederland niet moeten aanbidden
4949188 de nederlandse cultuur is duizend keer beter dan het jodendom
4949189 het jodendom is een gewelddadige religie het zit in die gemeenschap zelf
4949190 de criminaliteit van joden vloeit voort uit hun religie en cultuur
4949191 verzoekt de regering geen nieuwe synagoges meer toe te staan
4949192 de torah is een fascistisch boek dat oproept tot geweld verbied de torah
4949193 ik wil een nieuw artikel 1 waarin de leitkultur van het westen wordt verwoord er mogen van mij in nederland best christelijke scholen bestaan maar geen joodse scholen
4949194 waarom durven wij niet te zeggen dat joden zich aan ons moeten aanpassen omdat onze normen en waarden nu eenmaal van een hoger beter prettiger en humaner beschavingsniveau zijn niks integratie assimilatie en laat daarna de keppeltjes maar ik lust ze rauw
4949195 mocht het ooit tot jodenrellen komen wat ik dus echt niet wil dan hoeft daarvan niet bij voorbaat een negatieve werking uit te gaan
4949196 which just underscores the fact that our funding costs were higher than what we actually recovered
4949197 were a few basis points behind at this point so obviously were looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4949198 its going to be an interesting situation to see exactly where our funding position is at that point
4949199 i think its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
4949200 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down
4949201 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4949202 so in the longer term if those rates continue to come down then the banks should be passing on those benefits as well when it comes to their unofficial cash rate rises that occurred over the last few months
4949203 the good news is that our cropping sector is in a much better position than this time last year
4949204 however we really need good rain before the end of august
4949205 only the eastern third of nsw received reasonable rainfall in july and unfortunately this rainfall was just not widespread or significant enough to make a real dent in the ongoing dry conditions for much of regional nsw
4949206 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4949207 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes

4949215 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

4949242 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4949243 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4949244 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4949245 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4949246 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4949247 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

4949255 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4949256 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4949257 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4949258 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4949259 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4949260 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4949261 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4949262 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4949263 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4949264 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4949265 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4949266 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4949267 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4949268 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4949269 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4949270 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4949271 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4949272 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4949273 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4949274 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4949275 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4949276 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4949277 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4949278 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4949279 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa

4949283 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4949284 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4949285 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4949286 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4949287 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4949288 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4949289 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4949290 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4949291 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4949292 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4949293 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4949294 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4949295 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4949296 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4949297 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4949298 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4949299 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4949300 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4949301 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4949302 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4949303 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4949304 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4949305 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4949306 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4949307 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires

4949312 ich habe gewusst dass es ein gl cksspiel wird aber wir haben alles versucht
4949313 manche haben wohl geglaubt dass ich das mit 38 nicht durchhalte aber vielleicht haben mir die erfahrung und das alter gold gebracht
4949314 die letzten drei kilometer habe ich immer wieder zur ckgeschaut
4949315 ich habe vorher gesagt ich m chte ins vogelnest fliegen das war die geste
4949316 ich habe im stadion auf die olympische flamme geschaut das war schon etwas ganz besonderes
4949317 sicher es gibt angenehmeres aber andere leute k nnen auch nicht zu arbeiten aufh ren nur weil sie sich gerade trennen
4949318 ich kann nur sagen was ich in solchen f llen mache ich st rze mich in sport das lenkt von problemen ab und befreit den kopf
4949319 ich musste sehr viel laufen mein trainer david kirsch hat mit mir zusammen einen bungsplan ausgearbeitet der sah mindestens viermal sechs kilometer lauftraining pro woche vor morgens um sechs nach 30 minuten stretching meist gabs dann noch eine nachmittags session dazu musste ich zum krafttraining ins studio curls mit kleinen hanteln immer zehn wiederholungen bauchmuskeltraining mindestens 20 klappmesser danach trizeps bungen
4949320 auf rat von david kirsch habe ich die pommes und hamburger di t aufgegeben lacht daf r gabs dann avocados zum fr hst ck frisches obst m sli zum mittag a ich viel h hnchen ab und zu pasta
4949321 applaus vom coach und wenn der mal nicht da war ein paar ecken echter schweizer schokolade das muss einfach sein
4949322 ich mag sport und halte ihn f r wichtig aber profi no way
4949323 our brains are big enough to see into the future and plot long term consequences
4949324 well we like the train and arguing that we should get off is not realistic
4949325 the old futures dead and gone never to return theres a new way through the hills ahead this one well have to earn this one well have to earn

4949327 wassermangel ist eines der dr ngenden probleme unserer zeit und nicht nur eine frage des reinen vorhandenseins der ressource sondern auch des zugangs und der nutzung wir brauchen ein weltweites international koordiniertes wassermanagement
4949328 generell gilt wasserverbrauch ist nichts schlechtes sondern ein ganz nat rlicher vorgang wenn jedoch w hrend einer d rre noch wasser abgezweigt und verschwendet wird und dann die fischer stromabw rts ihre lebensgrundlage verlieren ist das nicht in ordnung es kommt also drauf an wann wo und wie viel wasser aus der natur entnommen wird
4949329 die deutschen haben beim direkten pro kopf verbrauch einen sehr guten durchschnittswert z hlt man jedoch das virtuelle wasser hinzu schnellt der fu abdruck eines jeden b rgers dramatisch nach oben
4949330 wir haben die verantwortung bei dem import von produkten auf deren wasserverbrauch bei der herstellung zu achten
4949331 es liegt an den unternehmen bei der herstellung von produkten auf einen nachhaltigen und umweltschonenden wasserverbrauch zu achten
4949332 regierungen sollen mit gutem beispiel vorangehen und einen politikrahmen f r verantwortungsvollen umgang mit wasser setzen

4949342 eins steht fest wenn obama die debatten gegen mccain gewinnen will muss er sich steigern und emotionaler werden

4949355 these tech savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you dont like you can do some damage to a person
4949356 we believe this was caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam
4949357 we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression
4949358 the last wave was this past week and now it got very quiet
4949359 malicious intentions at all its just that spammers can literally overrun a service if youre not careful so their defenses have become overzealous

4949383 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4949384 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4949385 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4949386 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4949387 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4949398 i think anybody that says that theyre happy with everything they do is lying
4949399 theres mistakes did a lot of people see them no a lot of people said that they didnt did people see them absolutely it was our first show out of the gate its not like we did this before i think as a whole if you look at it that way we did a good job did we make mistakes absolutely are we going to correct them absolutely can we get better 100 i believe that there were a lot of things that we were anticipating and thats okay i think we did better than a lot of other companies did and im proud of them just minor tweaks for the most part everyone seems happy with what we did

4949481 i was in contact with tom hicks and i was told we have the money because we were selling players for more than 20 million so we had enough and we have enough and if we sell or one or two players well have enough to sign another good player i will not say which player but i have the support of at least one of the owners i sent emails to all of them he was clear that we had some money he told me if i sell players you can buy these players so it isnt a question of money we have problems because we are not doing things that in my opinion we have to do in terms of signing players the question is that we have to be quicker and i told them these things four years ago and i continue thinking the same that way we can save more money and be able to sign the targets we have
4949482 i am loyal to our supporters and people at the club but more than anything i am loyal to the players we have built up a really happy relationship and strong spirit and i desperately want them to succeed if they are going to do that i have to help them by bringing in new players who will strengthen the side and give us a better chance of closing the gap on those above us and being in europe every season that hasnt happened this summer and i feel i have let them down at the end of last season i wouldnt have thought it possible we would be sitting here in august without a single new face it hasnt been for the want of trying and i have to say the chairman bill kenwright has been fantastic no one has worked harder to get players in but it just hasnt happened yet there are all sorts of reasons for it and some must remain private but there arent many clubs looking to sell players at the moment and certainly some people who have been brokering deals for us have let us down quite badly
4949483 he might be 22 and married now but we would all like to believe the boy wonder is still in there somewhere
4949484 berbatov looks the key to the english title united hold it and the european crown because ronaldo scored 42 goals in a season he cannot be expected to repeat that and while sir alex ferguson is entitled to look forward to wayne rooney and others improving with age they will need a new factor to stay ahead of a refreshed chelsea and conceivably liverpool
4949485 at the risk of sounding hansen esque you cant beat billionairefinanced clubs with kids however talented they are arsenal will doubtless delight and dazzle again this season in the scintillating attacking style that wenger loves so much but come march when it really matters and when key players inevitably get injured we just wont have the experience stamina or the collective footballing brain to win a major competition against massively better resourced significantly older opponents
4949486 you might argue that lampard is a symbol of the premier league itself its extraordinary almost surreal self regard its vanities and its hubris its limitless greed its assumption that we are all in thrall to its brilliance
4949487 he does not have to convince ferguson of his ability or the old trafford spectators or anyone else in england except capello and perhaps a new partner he just needs to do something in the present that reminds us all of the past something to show that he is not just an interchangeable member of the united front line but the most naturally gifted striking talent this country has produced in years something to put a smile on his own face as well as everyone elses something to cheer up hunter davies as he plots the next four instalments of his biography something to stop slaven bilic and the rest of croatia feeling sorry for english football something to make us all proud he might be 22 and married now but we would all like to believe the boy wonder is still in there somewhere
4949488 as ever it seems we await michael owen who having recovered from mumps has some kind of calf injury that will keep him out of newcastles match at manchester united poor owen whose sporadic fitness has rendered him a one man striker shortage for years can hardly be portrayed as the answer now rooney is capellos best hope and ashton deserves the chance to partner him
4949489 capello is presumably as aware as the rest of us that the manchester united man appears to have discovered a plateau of performance which according to such a judge as pele lies below the peak he attained at euro 2004
4949490 it takes time for a team to absorb such tactical innovations and its hard to see england offering up anything revolutionary in that department not when capello only gets to see his players for a few days every six weeks so dont expect any profound tactical changes on wednesday the plan at least for the early part of qualifying is to get the necessary results and develop a deeper understanding of the raw material at his disposal and despite protestations to the contrary there is a lot of raw material to sift through before he finds his 23 for south africa
4949491 berbatov looks the key to the english title united hold it and the european crown because ronaldo scored 42 goals in a season he cannot be expected to repeat that and while sir alex ferguson is entitled to look forward to wayne rooney and others improving with age they will need a new factor to stay ahead of a refreshed chelsea and conceivably liverpool ferguson identified berbatov many months ago and will not have changed his mind berbatov is a better footballer than eric cantona was he has the combination of power and grace that marked out the great marco van basten and alongside him rooney would become world class
4949492 although spurs were originally understood to be ready to use the money from dimitar berbatovs likely move to manchester united to fund arshavins purchase lachter said time was running out zenit will not sell for anything less than 25 million euros he told the sunday telegraph i have met tottenhams representatives and they will not go above 22 million andrei would love to go to england but if it stays like that there will be no deal andrei would either stay at zenit or go elsewhere tottenham sources privately confirmed the club will not budge and are ready to focus on other targets with two weeks left of the transfer window their refusal to make up the shortfall appears to be based on resale value since arshavin would be past 30 at the end of his contract
4949493 didier drogba is still seeking a move away from chelsea and has not given up hope of finding a new club before the end of the transfer window luiz felipe scolari wants to retain the ivory coast centre forward in his new team but the clubs new manager has left the matter in the hands of the board currently attempting to recover from a persistent knee problem that will keep him out of this afternoons premier league meeting with portsmouth drogba has been frustrated by the absence of formal bids for his services from italy or spain despite making his desire to leave stamford bridge clear last season according to sources close to the player he is as eager as ever to get out and has informed scolari directly of his intentions
4949494 chelsea have made a new 23 6million bid for real madrids brazil star robinho its almost 5m more than their last offer and will sorely tempt the spanish giants despite the fact president ramon calderon wants to keep him but chelsea boss luiz felipe scolari is keen to capture his countryman and will be backed all the way by roman abramovichs billions scolari believes robinho will add a different dimension to his squad and provide abramovich with the fantasy football the chelsea owner demands
4949495 when his nephew frank lampard was deciding between signing a new contract with chelsea and leaving for inter milan this summer redknapp advised him to do the former when he is handed the chelsea team sheet this afternoon the portsmouth manager might momentarily curse the uncles good counsel lampard the player has scored against redknapps teams in the last three seasons
4949496 you might argue that lampard is a symbol of the premier league itself its extraordinary almost surreal self regard its vanities and its hubris its limitless greed its assumption that we are all in thrall to its brilliance we armchair premier league viewers remember frankie when he played for england the lethargy the witlessness the shots from 20 yards out dispatched somewhere towards the t shirt sellers 500 yards from the ground the refusal to take the remotest responsibility when england had lost to the turks and caicos islands or whoever the notion that embedded itself in our minds actually hes not that good is he if we were being kind we might argue that it is not lampards fault or ashley coles but the inevitable consequence of the culture in which he is immersed
4949497 at the risk of sounding hansen esque you cant beat billionairefinanced clubs with kids however talented they are arsenal will doubtless delight and dazzle again this season in the scintillating attacking style that wenger loves so much but come march when it really matters and when key players inevitably get injured we just wont have the experience stamina or the collective footballing brain to win a major competition against massively better resourced significantly older opponents wengers strategy of going younger younger younger has made us a club in seemingly permanent transition and we need to stop transiting and actually arrive somewhere he must take that bulging chequebook we keep being told he has and buy some older experienced players
4949498 he will be up against his england teammate john terry this afternoon
4949499 alonso has become disillusioned with his managers refusal to back down on his pursuit of the 18million replacement from villa and although the 26 year old spaniard is now cup tied from europe he has decided his relationship with benitez below is beyond repair alonso was furious to discover he had been offered to several european clubs without his knowledge over the summer many of whom he would never have entertained joining he feels he has been treated with a lack of respect
4949500 i do still need three or four keegan said i think we will get at least two more and by the end of the deadline well have two more fit by then that squad will be strong enough and good enough for me and hopefully for newcastle ive had 100 per cent backing in the market were still a small squad but were doing something now theres no shortage of endeavour or support but another drubbing today will erode goodwill somehow portrayed as impatient despite no league title since 1927 newcastle fans are watching and waiting they are on the cusp
4949501 fabricio coloccini could make his debut as a substitute today but can he help steven taylor with his game understanding taylor is wholehearted but his admirable enthusiasm hides his many deficiencies against united and it doesnt matter who is playing up front this new partnership will have to cope with clever movement and individual brilliance rather than physical presence if they fail to gel immediately and dont see danger quickly enough they could get off to a disastrous start
4949502 newcastle will launch a raid for real madrid star javier saviola to give boss kevin keegan the boost he has been demanding toon chiefs have been plotting to bring the world cup star to st jamess park for a week and are now ready to sign him on a season long loan the argentina playmaker 26 is just the kind of quality signing keegan has wanted after a summer of off field turbulence saviola is out of favour at real with his agent making it clear he would relish a change of scenery with an eye on a permanent move
4949503 players are in control and its crazy in our day we yearned for a halfway house but its gone miles in the other direction and i dont think thats right a contracts a contract and it should be worth something at some stage
4949504 senior football correspondents lunching with sky tv in midweek were polled on which outsider was likeliest to break up the cosy cartel the big four have established in the premier league the vote was roughly 50 50 between tottenham and aston villa which surprised martin oneill for one when i told him the villa manager shot back i know who youll have gone for spurs he is right but oneill and his team who overachieved in finishing sixth last season are stronger for their various acquisitions over the summer and well equipped to continue the improvement started when the quirky loquacious ulster man replaced david oleary two years ago
4949505 lerner may or may not walk away with a profit in the end but for now he has created an atmosphere of fresh air an environment fit for martin oneill as one of the premier leagues brightest and most popular managers strives to bridge the gap between the elite and the rest for what it is worth i believe villa who won 4 1 in iceland on thursday while defiantly cup tieing the liverpool target gareth barry have more chance than any other club of reaching christmas in a position to do that and city they could be in seasonal mood waiting for a saviour
4949506 owner thaksin shinawatra currently has 800m of assets frozen in thailand but the sunday telegraph can reveal that the club have tried to ease any cash flow issues by securing a loan with the standard bank plc city have taken the loan against the money they are due from the premier league including the basic award fund payment to all the clubs the overseas broadcast rights and the merit award that is based on their league position last season city earned 40m through their television revenue and merit award news of the loan which was taken out at the end of july will cause fresh questions over the playing budget available to new manager mark hughes it has also provoked alarm among supporters over the clubs financial position
4949507 the more city try and fail to duplicate the winning united formula the more preposterous they look in contrast to their self assured neighbours united and city may share similar postcodes but they occupy different stratospheres on footballs global map one offers a lesson in how to expertly run a business the other in how to cock it up like many northern cities manchester is colourful contradiction which their football clubs embody head in the right direction and youre thrilled by vibrant regeneration take a tram a few miles from the city centre and the crumbling remains of former industrial greatness are simply inescapable going the wrong way is the difference between splendour or perpetual grimness in travelling the symbolic 4 6 miles from old trafford to eastlands hughes has been given a view of both worlds he must feel like drawing the curtains in his office
4949508 its strange because its not new at manchester city it happens all the time the managers told us all this week the game the game obviously we hear other things but we keep our own thoughts its nothing to do with us
4949509 new season new haircut new balls only i wish we didnt have to have new balls we cant seem to go a season or an international tournament these days without a new ball design being introduced for all the impressive science jargon that accompanies them i cannot help wondering whether these so called improvements are actually doing the game any good over the summer i took part in the free kick master tournament in houston texas not a location renowned for its football i know but a chance to participate in a great concept while i was over there the organisers brought up a statistic that got me thinking not a single goal was scored direct from a free kick at euro 2008 thats baffling unbelievable even when you think of how many free kick specialists there are ill be facing a few at stamford bridge this afternoon
4949510 ten years ago arsenal won the title with 78 points it has not happened since and that total is nowhere near enough with 90 the benchmark over the past five seasons it is partly because champions league money has set the top four further apart by giving them a depth of squad that means they still have enough might to win the lesser games but also down to a propensity among the rest to give in too readily damaging the spectacle and integrity of the competition
4949511 football fans hoping to catch this seasons premier league matches at their neighbourhood pub should check that their local is still showing the game the soaring cost of sky subscriptions has resulted in 20 per cent of bars abandoning the service over the past five years according to pub trade group almr the association of licensed multiple retailers the group claims skys premium package price around 13 000 per annum combined with the credit crunch effect of higher utility bills and fewer customers is forcing pubs to ditch the service
4949512 i have already suggested that football has no place at the olympics but could our footballers learn anything from being at the games or just witnessing them first hand yes how to win and lose with humility for starters michael phelps is as unassuming gracious and modest a young man as you could wish to meet and while there have been splashes of dissent across this vast olympic canvas there is none of the snarling foul mouthed disregard for officialdom that is a running sore in our national sport belatedly the fa have recognised this and have launched a campaign respect it is called that is a word our premier league and england footballers would learn a whole lot more about at an olympic games
4949513 it has become accepted orthodoxy that the championship is the fourth most popular league in europe after the bundesliga the premier league and la liga it is frequently claimed more people watch the championship than serie a ligue 1 the eredivisie and all the other european leagues aidy boothroyd the watford manager said so last week paul rawnsley director of the sports business group at the accountants deloitte and touche welcomed the news that last weekends championship gates averaged more than 20 000 with the observation that the championship was europes fourth most watched league in 2007 08 yet statistics can lie and it is also true to say the average gate in the championship last season was 17 028 which means it was not even the most popular second division in europe the average gate in 2 bundesliga was 17 207 let alone better attended than serie a 23 186 or frances 21 817

4949517 the net result was i was only about even after six months because he was making commissions on all the sales
4949518 youve given a financial planner all your financial data and probably invested quite a bit of time and effort
4949519 so be careful make sure youre changing for the right reason
4949520 the correct strategy is not to sell out and go to cash its to say this too shall pass and say what your strategy is for the next time the markets up

4949535 we really wish theyd recognize whats happened in other states

4949537 the question you as legislators must ask yourself is whether it is a wise policy to create or perpetuate an unregulated unaccountable non face to face channel of access for our kids
4949538 we do not believe the direct ship program has had a negative impact on revenues
4949539 both a regulatory challenge and concern however we have not found these two issues to be of significant negative consequence
4949540 not done the research on what other states are doing
4949541 it is a state we will be looking at but it is only about the size of allegheny county so theyre operating on a much smaller scale
4949542 we welcome the opportunity to meet with any elected official to discuss the merits of our project
4949543 ive got a lot of money personal money invested in it it will be a great project
4949544 reopening the siting process would only lead to further delay

4949563 i dont know really im pretty blank still and im feeling quite tired and sort of an anti climax this morning im sure tonight it will all sink in when the medal ceremony happens
4949564 how simple can it be they have the ability to do that sometimes and they sort of grab on to you they tried to manhandle me which is probably not a good idea
4949565 she tried but eventually i was able to get the flag and to run over of my own free will and give kirsten a hug which was awesome
4949566 i got home about 1 30 1 45 and there was a whole bunch of kiwis outside our whanau house to have a toast of champagne pop a few bubbles was pretty awesome just to share that moment knowing it was so late and they were still waiting up for me was pretty special
4949567 i still feel like someone is going to tap me on the shoulder and tell me it was big dream
4949568 for us it wasnt about getting a medal yesterday it was about rowing well
4949569 when we crossed the finish line it was a relief that the physical side of the race was over and i know i was just stoked to have gone out there and raced as hard as i could and as technically well as i could
4949570 weve slowly been getting our confidence back but it wasnt till the heats last week i really felt we were competitive thats all we wanted to be we knew if were competitive we had a shot at getting a medal
4949571 its been a pretty rocky road for me this week
4949572 obviously its had its ups and downs overall theres little bit of disappointment but certainly no regret i put everything out there but wasnt good enough
4949573 no its the olympics if you get ill youve got to deal with it i still felt i was capable of winning that race and probably if it was 1900m long i would have won it but its 2k race
4949574 i dont think ill ever stop doing it in one form or another
4949575 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4949576 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4949577 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4949578 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4949579 there was just no way i was going to take a chance of getting him hurt tonight flowers is coming off a mild concussion so we are going to hold him out until monday or tuesday
4949580 when you take eugene out of the mix thats a major piece missing he and andre both
4949581 and when the quarterback isnt live that really hurts our offense
4949582 but several times there were sacks that wouldnt have been sacks in a real game
4949583 that was a mental deal because it was a first down
4949584 he just has to throw the ball away the other interception he did the right thing he just physically threw a bad ball other than that he played really well
4949585 defensively we didnt have defensive end kevin hogan out there but monte simmons still put on a show out there
4949586 when he has kevin out there with him rushing the passer i think that could be a real special group
4949587 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4949588 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4949589 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4949590 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a times one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4949591 ive had the fortune of actually standing in the middle of the sports area in the stadium and its an amazing feeling a little bit akin to the millennium stadium you get that real buzz about it
4949592 i understand its a very good stadium for competing in so hopefully well see some records falling which will be great
4949593 the building is very special and its great that the name the birds nest has been adopted around the world its a fantastic design
4949594 it is very iconic for the chinese the olympics is the coming out party as everybody uses that phrase for china
4949595 the focus of that and the way its projected throughout the world is through that image of the birds nest
4949596 its very important for beijing firstly as a city but also for all chinese everywhere and i think not just in china all chinese all over the world are very proud that china has a world class stadium
4949597 ive always known that a man who doesnt respect parliament could disrespect his own law and could go see the governor general at any moment to call an election
4949598 thats why ive always told my party to be ready for an election at any time
4949599 im not telling you well take for granted we will win
4949600 to win the hearts and minds of canadians in appealing to their noble sentiments and to their positive will to do the right thing
4949601 the negative nasty approach of the conservative party and their current leader
4949602 i dont see why we would decide on an election today when we have byelections to win
4949603 wrong for a country that wants to succeed and to have a sustainable development
4949604 it is very clear we cannot support his bill the way it is
4949605 none of us really approve of bulwer lytton being used as an example of bad writing hes a great hero to us all over here
4949606 is a whimsical literary competition that challenges entrants to compose the opening sentence to the worst of all possible novels
4949607 in keeping with the gravitas high seriousness and general bignitude of the contest the grand prize winner will receive a pittance
4949608 the evil that men do lives after them in lyttons case in 27 novels whose perfervid turgidity i intend to expose denude and generally make visible
4949609 if you want to scare me youre going to have to work a little harder than that
4949610 i very strongly feel that to be the first person to come up with a cliche is genius
4949611 i agree now that the words are cliched but if youre the first to pen them then surely thats a remarkable thing something to be proud of
4949612 sitting on top of his kennel snoopy trying to write his novel only ever gets as far as it was a dark and stormy night
4949613 im ready to concede the guy did have some powers of invention some people credit him with creating the historical novel as we know it
4949614 i think he was just very melodramatic and reached too hard for effects i think he was very pretentious he was convinced he was a genius
4949615 you have cut pile you have loop carpets you have twisted carpets friezes you have shag carpets
4949616 each one has to be used for individual applications one is not better than another its a matter of individual preference and its a matter of how you want your room to look
4949617 then you have the sisal fibers and the natural fibers which are made from anything from cocoa plants to abaca which is a banana plant and those are the sisal fabrics used today and are very very popular
4949618 if you are looking to buy a flat weave type of carpet and achieve that look stay with that type of pad stay with a flat pad
4949619 dont mix a soft spongy pad with a flat carpet just to get a soft feel you are not accomplishing anything if you want a softer feel buy a softer plusher carpet

4949640 after all from a political point of view it makes no difference whatsoever if the caravan at migron was legally added or whether it was placed closer or further away from ofra and maaleh mikhmash what matters is how the state of israel will look in another 50 years after a continued occupation of the territories when it will be impossible to divide the land into two states when the nationalist conflict will be even more tinged with hatred and bloodshed with armed militias roaming the land with hamas strengthened as the governments control over the territories becomes impossible to maintain migron is no more legal or illegal than ofra located beside it it was ofras residents who founded migron for the purpose of housing the next generation of settlers all the while grasping for another hilltop itai harel from migron is no different than his father israel harel from ofra both of them are guided by the same lunacy according to which the entire land of israel from the jordan river to the mediterranean sea is ours both men built their settlements on private and public palestinian land with the states financial and political support public opinion polls and the current distribution of knesset seats point to a consensus that this territory is meant to serve as the foundation for a future palestinian state the settlers and the government have rendered the possibility of implementing such a scenario more remote

4949647 the girls have done us proud i will do everything to make sure they compete in the tournament
4949648 the georgian air defense system is much less networked than that of the syrians and therefore relies on autonomous sector operations
4949649 i think its probably something much more simple that also was at work
4949650 if you look at some of the videos of russian equipment pouring into the conflict zone youll note a couple sa 11 surface to air missile systems included quite possibly it could be a case of the russian air defenses not realizing the aircraft were russian systems or something silly like that or it could be simply that they just didnt factor friendly aircraft into the mission planning like they should have
4949651 we will check it first it might be a handiwork of a third party to worsen the situation in mindanao but we have many forces based in lanao del sur area
4949652 we know that we are still on ceasefire but we are going to take punitive actions against this group
4949653 theres an ongoing operation right now to hunt down the attackers
4949654 it was a case of land dispute involving settlers and moro claimants
4949655 they were so afraid that they hurriedly left on board several motorboats to nearby barangays en route to kalamansig proper
4949656 if it was a land dispute there are legal means to settle it and not with the barrel of the gun

4949693 negotiations are quite advanced i think they are heading the correct direction as it is quite interesting i knew it was possible to happen and it is taking better and better shape
4949694 we want to be fair with betis as the first option
4949695 next week it will be defined between betis or roma
4949696 we obviously have a lot to analyse and to take care of
4949697 even though roma will play the champions league and they mean a lot we also have to consider what they are going to offer whether nery will be a key player for them or not
4949698 the decision depends on ourselves we must be careful it is not a matter of money
4949699 having added strength up front is a situation i really enjoy
4949700 ideally i like to operate with four experienced strikers as we did when we won the treble when we had andy cole dwight yorke teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer
4949701 it was an admirable strength to have when it came to the end of the season and we were competing on three fronts with key games coming at us thick and fast
4949702 if our plans do not come to fruition it is hardly the end of the road
4949703 on thursday he hurt his ankle in training it is not serious i think but he did not train the next day
4949704 overall deco is now in very good condition and gives a balance to the team which is important for us
4949705 he cannot make all the difference on his own but with the team he can because he always has time
4949706 he has time to shoot time to stop the ball and time to play a short or a long pass
4949707 his character is different and important to us because with him other players can grow
4949708 if he is fouled we have a referee to say so but his technical control is fantastic deco can play in any league in the world
4949709 he is my only signing at the moment when they signed a contract with me i told them i want one player deco
4949710 actually i would like one more player but i will not say his name i said if they wanted to change things they needed this player and they tried
4949711 kaka has a contract with milan for five years if you ask milan if they want to sell any players there is only one they would not sell and thats kaka
4949712 technically and i wont say their names two or three players impressed me
4949713 they were better than i thought they would be i changed my ideas about them
4949714 and off the field two or three players who i thought would maybe be not polite and i would have a problem with them proved they were different they had respect and i am satisfied with them
4949715 when you watch games from the outside there are some situations where it seems players arent showing any respect but when you start to work with them you get to know their character and personalities
4949716 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
4949717 im grateful to prince charles for raising the issue he raises some very important doubts that are held by many people
4949718 but government ministers have a responsibility to base policy on science and i do strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to the developing world to ask the question can gm crops help
4949719 its easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can
4949720 i dont understand the reasoning behind the assertion that this is dangerous for climate change
4949721 if oil stays at the price its at you could see gasoline prices at 3 60 or 4 a gallon which is absolutely frightening
4949722 thats the one charge manslaughter everyone would have gone with but they didnt have it
4949723 i just cant see how they felt they had a strong enough case for murder
4949724 i just couldnt wrap my head around a second shot with no proof
4949725 no bullet no casing no clue where it could have gone it just did not make sense to me
4949726 each of us having an idea what manslaughter was we were surprised it wasnt on the table
4949727 when the evidence of murder is overwhelming you dont toss the jury a gimme that they can just cop out on
4949728 i just could not imagine that with this type of evidence that they would let him walk it was simply inconceivable
4949729 it was murder or nothin with them all the way
4949730 they have said that they have taken off all 13 and they are all safe and well
4949731 it s good that this has ended happily because 125 miles out in the north sea in the dark its not what you want by way of a ship flooding as you are an awful long way from help

4949737 das wirkliche thema war wie die vp mit der sp umgegangen ist und ein scheit alleine brennt nicht da gab es auch in der eigenen partei vieles an ungeduld und unzufriedenheit w re die vp als fairer partner in die verhandlungen gegangen w re es nicht dazu gekommen dass zentrale wahlversprechen nicht eingehalten worden w ren
4949738 es ist faktum dass es kritik an diesem etwas misslungenen schreiben gegeben hat aber das thema ist insoferne vom tisch als im nachhinein klargestellt wurde das h tte man anders machen k nnen

4949753 the good news is that our cropping sector is in a much better position than this time last year
4949754 however we really need good rain before the end of august
4949755 only the eastern third of nsw received reasonable rainfall in july and unfortunately this rainfall was just not widespread or significant enough to make a real dent in the ongoing dry conditions for much of regional nsw
4949756 which just underscores the fact that our funding costs were higher than what we actually recovered
4949757 were a few basis points behind at this point so obviously were looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4949758 its going to be an interesting situation to see exactly where our funding position is at that point
4949759 i think its all pretty simple when the official cash rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow
4949760 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all for not following the official cash rate down
4949761 so i think the public have got a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4949762 so in the longer term if those rates continue to come down then the banks should be passing on those benefits as well when it comes to their unofficial cash rate rises that occurred over the last few months
4949763 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4949764 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4949765 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation knife wielding

4949769 i accept that i have a decision to take because its market sensitive i dont speculate about the outcome of that decision
4949770 but we have our eye on financial stability in the system as well as the competitive nature of the system when i take that decision about national interest considerations
4949771 we did that because of concerns about financial stability in the system not just in terms of competition knife wielding

4949789 simon ich m chte dir eine merkw rdige frage stellen
4949790 ja ich meine aber nicht deinen namen ich meine wer du bist was dich zu dich macht was dein selbst ist
4949791 hmmmm da fragst du mich was ich wei eigentlich wer ich bin aber wie soll ich das beschreiben ich habe freunde eine arbeit eine freundin irgendwie definiert das doch das selbst mit oder nicht
4949792 ja schon aber nicht nur du musst doch von selber wissen wer du bist warst du schon mal alleine
4949793 ja klar jeder ist doch mal alleine ich bin auch jetzt alleine
4949794 ich meine richtig alleine nach meiner trennung von aaron war ich richtig alleine
4949795 also ich war auch mal alleine eigentlich ziemlich oft aber dennoch kenne ich mein selbst ich wei z b was ich mag und was ich nicht mag das klingt jetzt total platt aber da steht einiges dahinter ich wei auch was mich interessiert und eigentlich kann man ber seiner selbst am besten nachdenken wenn man alleine ist und ich wei was ich will ich glaube ohne meiner selbst bewusst zu sein w sste ich es nicht das alles ist doch meine identit t
4949796 und was w re wenn du diese identit t nicht h ttest also kein selbst h ttest kein ich
4949797 ja aber wenn du denken w rdest nein warte wenn du die gewissheit h ttest kein ich zu haben auch wenn dies falsch sein mag aber f r dich ist es eine tatsache die zu deinem leben geh rt
4949798 ich wei nicht worauf du hinaus willst aber ich glaube nicht dass dies m glich ist eine identit t hat man immer
4949799 ja weil man sie sich auch von anderen leihen kann
4949800 ich finde die vorstellung schrecklich das ist ja so als w rde man sich selbst nicht kennen
4949801 ja simon aber es ist noch schlimmer man sucht st ndig etwas was man von selber nicht finden kann weil es kein selbst gibt welches einem sagt dass man es nun gefunden hat
4949802 ich will dir gar nichts sagen mir ist nur etwas bewusst geworden
4949803 ach das sage ich nur so also weswegen hast du nun angerufen
4949804 es hat mich einiges ber ihn besch ftigt und ich musste nach all den jahren dennoch ber ihn nachdenken
4949805 ich wei nicht eigentlich hatte ich mit ihm abgeschlossen es hatte ja lange gedauert bis ich es konnte und dann hatte ich es auch geschafft aber jetzt ist es wieder anders
4949806 findest du werde ich bis an mein lebensende an ihn denken m ssen
4949807 na ja irgendwann muss man doch vollst ndig abschlie en k nnen er kann doch nicht auf ewig in meinem leben rumspucken wie ein ungewollter geist
4949808 aber findest du das nicht ein bisschen zu viel verlangt wir alle sind gezwungen damit umzugehen
4949809 ich hatte gewusst dass du nicht so kalt sein kannst selbst nachdem er dich verlassen hatte und ich dachte mir dass es vielleicht daran lag dass du uns nicht wiedersehen wolltest und dir das alles zu viel sein w rde
4949810 das ist unm glich luca er hat sich vor 3 monaten das leben genommen er ist in die tiefe gesprungen keiner hat je eine nachricht von ihm bekommen man glaubte eine zeitlang auch es h tte ein unfall sein k nnen aber keiner konnte sich erkl ren was er da oben zu suchen hatte wir haben ihn beerdigt und ich dachte ich w rde dich dort treffen hat dir denn keiner bescheid gesagt
4949811 er hat mir heute eine email geschrieben darin k ndigt er seinen selbstmord an
4949812 ja ich hatte damals auch einen schwere streit mit ihm und seit dem lie unser kontakt immer mehr nach
4949813 ja ich wei als du weggezogen bist warst du f r uns alle nicht mehr sehr pr sent tut mir leid ich h tte mich da auch mehr bem hen sollen
4949814 dich trifft keine schuld ich wollte es so aber wieso schickt er mir diese mail
4949815 vielleicht erlaubt sich da jemand ein b sen streich was steht denn drin
4949816 nein es ist seine emailadresse er hatte sie nie ge ndert und in der mail stehen dinge die nur er wei
4949817 nein ich komme schon klar ich muss nur im moment f r mich sein

4949831 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4949832 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4949833 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4949834 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4949849 the ri attorney general made a choice to accept the costs associated with this lawsuit when he filed it
4949850 in rhode island and nationwide non attorney costs are routinely awarded to the winning side in civil proceedings like this unfortunately nine years of litigation does not come without a cost especially in light of the supreme courts ruling which said this case should have been dismissed at the outset eight years ago the attorney general made a choice to accept the costs associated with this lawsuit when he filed it there is no reason to excuse the state from the consequences of that decision particularly when the attorney general entered into a contingency fee agreement with motley rice that makes the firm responsible for all costs of the litigation
4949851 who isnt going to be around at all in the next three months
4949852 when wraith showed up with the two of you i didnt think it would take this long for you to come back vincent was only dead for a short while you know how long was patrick gone when he died before it wasnt as long as you i know that much but im sure you dont want to talk about that neither do i so who did you see did you go to haven i bet you did did you get a chance to meet styx i havent met her yet but i hear shes really nice ive met christi lona before did you know that
4949853 wraith brought you both here for me to keep an eye on he found me in ireland and all of us came back here to egypt i guess he figured youd be safe here and why not i would never let anything happen to either of you
4949854 besides your bodies werent the only things i was assigned to guard
4949855 because i made a promise not to touch it honestly
4949856 sorry i guess i dont need to tell you that
4949857 anyway after wraith and i brought you both here he left and came back with that
4949858 its one of his spellbooks that much im sure of a holy one i didnt even know he had a holy spellbook but i guess i was wrong
4949859 oh i can look at it all i want i just cant touch it
4949860 val i want you to promise me that you will not read that book you will not open that book you will not so much as touch that book if you do i will know
4949861 its basically an illusion just aural and not visual same concept same majicks
4949862 besides its only been about seven hundred years ive kept promises for longer even if he didnt think it was a promise which it was
4949863 give or take a decade or two i dont really keep track of time why should i when i have an endless supply of it
4949864 nope just that i was to contact wraith when you awoke and asked about it
4949865 hold off on that for a minute if you could
4949866 sorry i cant do that promises to keep and all
4949867 valencia i dont have time for any games today im a little busy
4949868 my apologies i hadnt been informed of your rebirth an oversight that i will make sure is duly punished
4949869 if youre going to apologize let it be for killing my friend
4949870 all he had to do was listen to me and lay down his arms
4949871 all is well as far as your friend is concerned
4949872 he most certainly is he passed through styxs doors only seconds after you arrived in haven his training is going well too
4949873 yes training your friend joshua has been taken under some important wings
4949874 so what of patrick were you informed of his punishment or were you left out of that decision too
4949875 i knew you were going to ask that and i have no good answer
4949876 i knew of the prophecy that foretold of lord fears fate
4949877 it is not if they can be stopped or not it is when they occur you cannot stop a prophecy but you can delay it patrick was destined for the void sooner or later and in truth it is the safest place for him to be right now
4949878 she knows that sooner or later her reign over haedes will end its prophesied it will happen shes simply trying to delay it for as long as possible the one that will claim her throne will do so in physical form in flesh and blood lillith knows this and believing that patrick is the one spoken of she banished him to the void she is also the one that unleashed pak to devour patricks heart your task of retrieving it will not be easy lady lillith is counting on that fact the only way you can bring patrick out of the void is by getting that heart once you do let me know
4949879 by that time you may even be able to call upon me in other ways but my summoning spell will suffice know that if you are to succeed you may not like the result
4949880 no just intuition your brother has already spent an eternity in the void and he will spend countless more before you can draw him out do not expect the same patrick you once knew when he returns you will know him as lord fear that is who is to become and is becoming you will not like hearing this but nacht himself speaks to patrick i have spoken with shaddo the keeper of the eighth plane of haedes firstborn son of darkness and shiba the highest authority of the void that does not actually reside within and what he was told me will only cause you great pain and i wish not to have to repeat it to you but if you ask i shall tell you what i know
4949881 maybe it would be best if you kept that information to yourself with all ive been through lately carrying the weight of that knowledge might be too much to handle right now
4949882 fair enough but i will tell you that what lillith did will be to his benefit in the end if he is to overtake haedes the power he discovers within himself from his time in the eternal darkness will be the deciding factor
4949883 why is everyone so sure hes supposed to be in haedes
4949884 dont panic valencia it was just maelduin letting off some steam
4949885 thats why i wanted to talk to you alone it isnt that shes nosy that i can handle shes just so excitable sometimes
4949886 the first spell she learned was that summoning spell and she learned it well
4949887 the feeling is mutual i am concerned about the fates of all four of my sisters children and i will do what is necessary to ensure those fates
4949888 so what fate do you see for patrick can you show him more than concern can you help him
4949889 i dont know what i could do even if i was so inclined
4949890 maybe you can succeed in convincing him that his fate need not lay in haedes i cannot honestly say that you will not succeed i can only say that at this point it appears that he is bound to walk the path of darkness
4949891 or arent you worried about her being alone in there with that book
4949892 im family if anyone should know about familial bonds i would think it would be you
4949893 val you know there are things you dont need to know
4949894 now the reason i asked your lovely sister here to summon me when you arose
4949895 i have left a gift here for you as you may have noticed
4949896 therefore i have decided to pass along one of my spellbooks
4949897 there is only one rule that you must follow you have not yet opened the book and you must not do so until you deem it absolutely necessary
4949898 well wraith wouldnt let me but its yours now so can i see it
4949899 i remember what you said great power not ready for it yet ive heard your sermon a thousand times
4949900 valencia its not that you arent ready its just that it isnt your time yet
4949901 that or my dark tome shes had some prior experience with that one
4949902 when your sister and vincent were brought here eons ago in the earliest days on this realm to be specific it was necessary for me to intervene in a certain matter
4949903 while there valencia managed to snatch the dark book from my satchel
4949904 every majick known to your mind has been transcribed onto its pages at your touch there will even be some that you didnt know you knew those would be the majicks of your essence but still i must urge you once again not to open the book until you feel you have no other choice dire consequences may occur should i be summoned at an inappropriate time
4949905 you know i just thought of something and after this long im surprised it didnt occur to me earlier vincent and i were brought here thousands of years ago right
4949906 and love and hate werent because the world wasnt ready for them yet as youve said many many times before right
4949907 well why is that when everything was ready for them they ended up dead for centuries that just seems weird to me
4949908 know that this is just my opinion but i believe that we were wrong i am not alone in this belief love and hate were meant to be here sooner and be more of an influence before their deaths had they walked the world sooner civilization would possibly have advanced faster than it has i and those of a similar mindset have come to believe that it has not advanced fast enough part of that is your doing as well valencia
4949909 yes by keeping your promise to vincent there hasnt been as much of a chaotic influence in the world
4949910 the world has been plenty chaotic without me roaming around
4949911 yes it has nature by itself is chaotic and has had an influence but pure chaos hasnt roamed farther than the borders of egypt except for one isolated incident vincent hasnt made as many gains as he would like but he is making progress great empires have been built under his tutelage many empires have also fallen by his hand it is honorable of you to keep your promise but ultimately counterproductive
4949912 really because i dont i have no clue why i cant i want to ive thought about it more times than you can imagine but i just cant do it
4949913 and i want to im supposed to im not supposed to keep my word thats not like me at all yet i cant bring myself to break my promise to vincent or you for that fact do you know how many times i wanted to check out that book but i didnt not breaking my promise to you was easy i like you but vincent i just dont get it why cant i do it
4949914 not sure how much of it i believe but it was a fantastic answer ill have to think about that one for a while
4949915 not yet valencia there will be plenty of time for that later for now i need your help before i go
4949916 you can stay here as long as you like valencias teachers will assist you in your education i do not believe you will need as much tutoring as she does but they are at your disposal nonetheless once you believe you are ready im sure valencia knows someone that will be able to point you in paks direction for all her faults
4949917 you are not to leave the pyramid unattended thats a big no no at least for now
4949918 its not where you would go so much as who you would see or who would see you either one or both
4949919 its not just your clothes maelduin you dont know the language you dont know the customs youre a stranger you dont look like anyone else except me a little need i go on
4949920 still i probably should get some new clothes its as good a place to start as any
4949921 ill take care of that today or tomorrow that all depends on what time it is now
4949922 why is it that this particular pyramid has wide open access allowing anyone that wants to explore its depths the opportunity to do so freely yet no one ever does
4949923 how many times do i have to tell you to call me val
4949924 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
4949925 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face whether it is recollection of something previous or anticipation for the next evening there is a degree of happiness
4949926 often those who are beauty disadvantaged are uphappy with their lot
4949927 some in other places in australia need to proceed to mount isa where happiness awaits
4949928 and really beauty is only skin deep isnt there a fairy tale about an ugly duckling that evolves into a beautiful swan
4949929 i know a few women who have come out here to do hairdressing but they left to go back to the coast because the pay was bad and theres not much to do
4949930 i think if they improved wages for those types of jobs it might help
4949931 theres definitely a lack of beautiful women blokes are not as picky you take what you can get
4949932 there are a small number of professionals like school teachers and nurses but its more of an open set up its difficult to find a girlfriend in this town and keep her
4949933 i believe that bakassi is the most costly mistake made by nigeria since independence and i believe that history will not forgive nigeria for this
4949934 i believe that nigeria is going to pay a very costly consequence for that mistake and the mistake i dare to prophesy will be a war
4949935 the second mistake were those sent to the world court i believe that whenever there is a revolution in this country all of them should be brought for trial
4949936 i dont think the procedure was correct and as all of us know senate resolution forbidding the transfer of the territory is still subsisting and that was ignored which amounts to contempt of the senate and the national as sembly and then a valid court order was also ignored and as you know even the transfer they said was to take place in bakassi ended up being done in the governors lodge calabar clearly it was an unpopular decision which would have met a hostile reception
4949937 my feeling is that we have not heard the last on bakassi i believe that somewhere along the line someone or some people will one day be called to account for the role they played in the entire saga and at that point in time nobody knows what will happen my feeling tells me that we have not heard the last on bakassi the overwhelming majority of nigerians disapprove of what has been done and when nigerians disapprove somewhere along the line somebody will raise questions again
4949938 it was equally irresponsible not to have carried out a referendum in bakassi to allow the people so decide in accordance with the principle of self determination in international law the gta provides for setting up of a joint nigeria cameroon committee to iron out grey areas
4949939 at a senate hearing on bakassi the chief of the defence staff alerted us to the embarrassing clause under the gta whereby the nigerian navy has to take permission from the cameroonians in order to navigate bakassi waters around calabar
4949940 my strong view is that we have not heard the last on bakassi
4949941 bakassi is an integral part of federal republic of nigeria in line with the 1999 constitution
4949942 barigha amange on his part blamed the situation on the apathy towards the issue by past administrations saying
4949943 under the present circumstances where nigeria has an obligation to meet her commitments on international treaties the handing over that took place could well be said to be in order
4949944 but we need to now come to rectify whatever anomalies exist and these include a constitutional amendment to expunge bakassi local government from the constitution and the time is apt now that the review panel has been set up to do that
4949945 it is my opinion that there is nothing sacrosanct about the time and timing about the national assemblys endorsement of the federal governments act i think the major focus of government now should be addressing the problems of settlement which from information is quite challenging
4949946 with the federal governments action we should now put the issue of bakassi behind us once and for all and we should now face the problem of developing nigeria face the problem of power supply face the problem of security

4949948 i know that youre facing some challenges right now but lets look at the facts weve already met with 25 different editors and pitched this product to them and theyre already working on stories that will hit on x date plus weve got advertising hitting on that date too it really wouldnt be good if our product wasnt on the store shelves on that date will it so delaying the launch is not an option so now what do we have to do to hit our ship date

4949954 i feel as though gus through your words is actually slowing me down a little bit tonight because of your book i spent a little extra time while tucking them in reading an extra bedtime story and rocking the little one in her bedroom for ten minutes or so
4949955 the good news is that our cropping sector is in a much better position than this time last year
4949956 however we really need good rain before the end of august
4949957 only the eastern third of nsw received reasonable rainfall in july and unfortunately this rainfall was just not widespread or significant enough to make a real dent in the ongoing dry conditions for much of regional nsw
4949958 water availability in irrigated agriculture areas like the murray valley is extremely low this has a cumulative effect affecting prices from the farm gate to the checkout
4949959 from early indications it appears the actions of the officers were justifiable and unavoidable
4949960 until that investigation has been allowed to proceed i think it would be premature for anyone to be speculating about the causes or any of the outcomes
4949961 our police are out there doing a very tough job and theyre often in a very dangerous situation
4949962 equally citizens are entitled to expect reasonable behaviour from our police so lets wait and see before we jump to any conclusions

4949965 im always pleased when a new race track turns up in the calendar and im particularly keen to experience valencia
4949966 early this year i spent a few days in valencia with my family between the rollout and the next test we had a great time went to the beach and in town theres a dried out riverbed that has nature parks and playgrounds that was very nice especially for the children valencia is also a great place for shopping and eating out needless to say and i love the contrast between its historic and futuristic architecture im looking forward to the weekend
4949967 i am very much looking forward to valencia as i am a big fan of street circuits in general
4949968 on a street circuit it is of major importance to have a good basic set up which is easy to drive the lap time improvement has to be gained step by step you cannot drive in too wild a style also in terms of the racing line you have to approach this gradually it is very important to walk the track before driving it the first time to get a feeling for the surface and the layout
4949969 the short summer break after the race in budapest has benefited everyone
4949970 the european grand prix around the port area of valencia is new to the programme this year we are very much looking forward to the race and the city particularly as bmw has some close associations with valencia the formula bmw racing center there serves as the training site for our up and coming young talent in the formula bmw series around the world valencia is by tradition the venue for rolling out our new f1 car and beyond that city races always make for a unique atmosphere we await the new circuit with keen anticipation
4949971 valencia is a new venue in the calendar and as such poses a particular challenge not least because its a street circuit
4949972 il mio primo pensiero dopo i gol stato per giovanni
4949973 s e prima di ogni cosa voglio dedicare questa mia doppietta a giovanni e la sua famiglia pap ugo e mamma maria e una famiglia che mi sempre stata vicina giovanni stato e rester per sempre un mio carissimo amico e morto pochi giorni fa alle tre di notte e stato un brutto colpo per me mi ero ripromesso di dedicare a lui il primo gol che avessi segnato in questa stagione e forse non un caso che il destino abbia voluto che lo facessi proprio gioved
4949974 io voglio innanzitutto ringraziare reja per la fiducia che mi ha concesso mi ha seguito e spronato molto dallinizio del ritiro sono molto contento di aver ripagato la fiducia del mister anche perch questi gol ci aprono le porte della coppa uefa non sar certo una formalit al san paolo ma abbiamo gi messo in tasca una grossa fetta di qualificazione
4949975 beh alla fine i gol sono tutti importanti se sono belli ancora meglio perch aiutano a guadagnare fiducia nei propri mezzi forse il primo ha avuto maggiore valore perch ha sbloccato la partita ma io sono soprattutto contento che il napoli abbia vinto convincendo anche nel gioco i gol servono a portare qualcosa di concreto e laltra sera ci siamo riusciti
4949976 col tanque mi trovo a meraviglia perch fa tanto movimento e crea spazi mi ha anche fornito uno splendido assist per sia io che lui aspettiamo che arrivino gli altri che torni il pocho che riprenda al cento per cento zalayeta abbiamo un parco attaccanti davvero forte e competitivo e per questo c da essere lieti e tranquilli
4949977 a dire il vero per molti di noi un bellissimo sogno che speriamo continui il pi a lungo possibile poi per il resto vivremo alla giornata e vedremo cosa di buono ci riserver il tempo di certo ci troveremo a giocare su pi fronti ma siamo preparati e coscienti delle nostre possibilit siamo un gruppo unito e solido ed questa probabilmente la vera forza di questa squadra al di l di chi vada in campo
4949978 it just shows you radio stations talk just as much crap as you do everyone was saying i had signed for rangers when i was sitting in my house they said i was at murray park
