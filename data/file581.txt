5810078 it appears the uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools

5810084 an engineer named christopher scholes designed the qwerty layout in 1873 specifically to slow typists down the typewriting machines of the day tended to jam if the typist went too fast
5810085 that led to the reporting of the noose aboard the cgc nantucket apparently without that heightened awareness this incident would have been kept a tightly held coast guard secret
5810086 the defendant used a threatening and offensive tactic to intimidate peaceful civil rights marchers who were in louisiana to rally against racial intolerance
5810087 the civil rights division will continue to vigorously pursue racially motivated threats that violate federal law
5810088 the defendant committed a federal hate crime by using a powerful symbol of hate to intimidate a group of interstate travelers because of their race
5810089 it is a violation of federal law to intimidate oppress injure or threaten people because of their race and because those people are exercising and enjoying rights guaranteed and protected by the laws and constitution of the united states our civil rights laws protect the civil rights of all americans and they emphasize the reality that we are all members of one particular race the human race
5810090 few things are more vital to an organization than someone who has the moral courage to question the direction in which the organization is headed and then the strength of character to support whatever decision is made

5810097 if you want a picture of the future imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever
5810098 when we make a change in our lives going back to school starting a business pursuing a creative path we also provoke an identity shift and even though the changes are external often its more of an internal journey that we are being asked to take to ensure that we dont get lost along the way we need to connect with the core of our being the essence of who we are
5810099 the ships primary mission is to train those cadets and officer candidates but the vessel also has a public relations mission
5810100 racial discrimination and intolerance have no place in either the academy or the coast guard and these incidents run directly against the efforts being made to increase diversity throughout the coast guard
5810101 i have asked admiral allen not only to conduct a thorough investigation into the incidents but also to address the entire academy to convey that such behavior will not be tolerated in the service
5810102 we really cant let the few bring the majority who are doing exactly what they should be doing when theyre doing it down
5810103 this case has been portrayed by the news media as being about race
5810104 and the fact that it takes place in a small southern town lends itself to that portrayal but it is not and never has been about race it is about finding justice for an innocent victim and holding people accountable for their actions
5810105 i cannot overemphasize what a villainous act that was the people that did it should be ashamed of what they unleashed on this town
5810106 it was not a prank but a vicious and crude statement the people who did it should be ashamed of themselves and mortified at the havoc they have unleashed on this community
5810107 when a noose hangs from a schoolyard tree in the 21st century and young men are treated in a way that is not equal nor just it is not just an offense to the people of jena or to the african american community it is an offense to the ideals we hold as americans
5810108 the events in louisiana have saddened me and i understand the emotions
5810109 the justice department and the fbi are monitoring the situation down there and all of us in america want there to be you know fairness when it comes to justice
5810110 the events in louisiana have saddened me and i understand the emotions
5810111 the justice department and the fbi are monitoring the situation down there and all of us in america want there to be you know fairness when it comes to justice
5810112 i would expect the public to hold us to a higher standard
5810113 racial discrimination and intolerance have no place in either the academy or the coast guard and these incidents run directly against the efforts being made to increase diversity throughout the coast guard
5810114 i have asked admiral allen not only to conduct a thorough investigation into the incidents but also to address the entire academy to convey that such behavior will not be tolerated in the service
5810115 the noose story is not the epicenter of coast guard civil rights issues
5810116 he who passively accepts evil is as much involved in it as he who helps to perpetrate it he who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it

5810128 why did christ come the school of community says that christ came to educate humanity to its religious sense that is to educate humanity to understand to affirm to acknowledge that theres an ultimate purpose to all the movement of things this ultimate purpose is god thus christ came to educate man in the religious sense christ came to educate man to do everything as a function of his destiny

5810147 up to the task of the most sensitive public office
5810148 in an age where five million people are newly infected each year and women and girls too often do not have the choice to abstain an abstinence until marriage program is not only irresponsible its really inhumane
5810149 abstaining from sex is oftentimes not a choice and therefore their only hope in preventing hiv infection is the use of condoms
5810150 well maybe or maybe it was his day to go theres nothing he could have done to escape it hes just dead meat now son just one more wetback that should have stayed home over on his side of the river

5810164 as anyone who has read a paper watched tv surfed the web or chatted by a water cooler this week can attest the interest in fahrenheit 9 11 has grown to mammoth proportions

5810167 though commodity prices have come down significantly from record highs in mid july and the dollar has strengthened consumers can still expect to see increased inflation for some time to come as the producer price pressures feed through to consumer prices
5810168 the continued weakening of the housing market is an additional pressure and households will feel further squeezed in terms of real disposable income

5810194 its not the dreaded saturday night stay its three nights the three night thing is sort of a backdoor way to try to block business travelers
5810195 we were unsuccessful in a broad based introduction of saturday night stay requirements
5810196 we do continue to try to expand the saturday night stay
5810197 we offer different products to different customers based on their attributes thats better for an international carrier offering frequency and utility and different products on the same airplane
5810198 it burns me to sit in a seat for 800 while the guy next to me paid 400 or 200 for exactly the same seat going to the same place at the same time with the same cabin service
5810199 ask people whove just purchased the same car or the same ipod how much they paid and the satisfaction with their purchase is highest only if they both paid exactly the same thing
5810200 working on doing that our belief is that is the structural way in the market to differentiate
5810201 the industry is in no position to view fuel pressure as temporary
5810202 innovators are productive over a narrowing span of their life cycle
5810203 permit easier access to the frontier allowing people to make contributions at younger ages

5810212 cannot confirm the reduction of pharmaceuticals in water with carbon filters
5810213 what you see in many states is a reaction to the lack of action at the federal level
5810214 a lot of bottled water is actually tap water so there is no assurance that what is coming from the bottle is any safer than what is coming from the tap

5810220 he looks extremely thin to me and now they are saying his thighs are bigger than they use to be and they want him to lose the weight
5810221 because i always felt guilt that i couldnt give her more
5810222 they lined us up against the wall and asked our name age measurements height and weight
5810223 then they told us to lift our shirts up just below the the chest and they filmed us to see our body type thats when i was cut
5810224 girls here i know are 510 and size 0 and they want them to lose weight for fashion week i dont think anybodys body is naturally like that
5810225 she said they want her to be heroin chic she needs to have sunken cheeks
5810226 because when you think about it logically the reason were living longer is because were healthier and if were healthier at any given age then were less likely to be disabled

5810228 this is very good news that i can give to some very old people
5810229 i can tell my elderly patients that their chances of being able to take care of themselves 10 years from now is the same as it is now
5810230 as i like to say the older you get the healthier youve been
5810231 so getting to 100 really is a survival phenomenon and people who get there necessarily have to have been disability free not only in their early 90s but pretty much for the vast majority of their lives
5810232 costas if these olympics are as successful as they are shaping up to be most people believe this only further legitimizes the ruling party in the minds of most chinese citizens and even absent true liberty as we understand it the lives of hundreds of millions of chinese people are much better than they once were therefore whats the partys incentive to reform bush well first of all if you are a religious person you understand that once religion takes hold in a society it cant be stopped and secondly i think the olympics are gonna serve as a chance for people to come and see china the way it is and let the chinese see the world and interface and have you know the opportunity to converse with people from around the world
5810233 the ability to believe despite all evidence to the contrary is not necessarily a good thing in a president
5810234 for choosing to associate with the west and adhering to western political and economic values
5810235 this council must act decisively to reaffirm the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia
5810236 does this further your plan or does it frustrate your plan it seems to me that this is taking what you have said you wanted from your second day of law school and quintessentially throwing it out the window because something better and shinier came along
5810237 its done in about 1 5 percent of all procedures in the u s
5810238 bleeding is a major problem the majority of bleeding problems are related to the access site and a bleeding problem is related to long term survival
5810239 traditionally that has been the way our people do it
5810240 there is a steep learning curve you need 100 to 200 cases to feel confident with the technique it takes a couple of years in a practice with a high volume also it is technically more difficult in terms of the whole operation
5810241 it doesnt prolong the period of bed rest they need
5810242 since reports of erectile dysfunction ed incidence pathophysiology and treatment have shown a possible link between and ed pde5 inhibitors like tadalafil cialis have received increased attention for treating bph luts although they are currently only approved for ed the half life of tadalafil is 17 5 hours making it suitable as once daily therapy although the may alleviate luts is not completely understood several putative mechanisms are currently under investigation
5810243 its creating a political climate where immigrants are seen as a net benefit to the state
5810244 the states highest officeholder is sending a message that his state welcomes immigrants
5810245 were it not for immigrants and refugees massachusetts would have seen a population decline in the last seven years
5810246 immigrants are becoming increasingly important to the health of the state economy
5810247 its in the best interest of the state communities and immigrant families to expedite their integration
5810248 thats not the message the games are supposed to convey why have silvers and bronzes
5810249 the ioc and the ocog the local organizing committee of the olympic games shall not draw up any global ranking per country
5810250 most of the world wants it as gold and thats how we do it
5810251 has always aggregated it by total medals for as long as we can remember
5810252 and this big country would be below this one guy
5810253 they say its not official everybody says its not official
5810254 maintain 6th in beijing and move to 5th in london
5810255 you dont have to worry about the dna going haywire
5810256 the ability to on demand make as much as you want is obviously very very attractive
5810257 for a while we had the phones off its tough going but the people who are here we believe in this and we are riding it out
5810258 the good news is its consistent the higher your vitamin d status the lower the risk of your developing a
5810259 if you dont have adequate vitamin d you cannot efficiently absorb calcium
5810260 vitamin d also helps maintain bone health by keeping bone cells active
5810261 to get vitamin d levels to where they need to be to reduce the risk of hip fracture you need to be taking at least 1 000 international units of vitamin d a day from a supplement
5810262 they need to ask their doctor for the right test
5810263 women should strive to keep your above 125 nanomoles per liter year round to do that they are going to require supplements
5810264 a culture of dangerous clandestine binge drinking often conducted off campus has developed
5810265 pushes drinking into hiding heightening its risks including risks from drunken driving and it prevents us from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice
5810266 very rare case reports of pancreatitis with complications or with a fatal outcome
5810267 the diver and the camera drop at the same time
5810268 it makes you marvel at what these athletes will do we were thinking what must it be like to plummet from that height how can we capture the sensation
5810269 one of those lovely problems that keep you up at 4 a m building things in your mind
5810270 make you feel like you were in a race car looking sideways heading into the water
5810271 handstands are hardest divers go up a bit first you have to take the rope up then let go some people pick this up straight away others cant do it at all
5810272 if your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him something to drink in doing this you will heap burning coals on his head
5810273 you got to have an inside source to tell you where the money is
5810274 and when you get caught i just love this bit when you get caught blame it on the legacy of apartheid ok so what have you learned today
5810275 the way the foreigners see africa is sort of the way it is
5810276 wars people dying of diseases that were cured long ago and so on
5810277 get lost if you cant take a joke our job is to talk about things that are wrong and well keep doing it unless you kill us
5810278 and the guys were like lets move on you know they felt the culture had become boring and that it was time we started laughing at ourselves
5810279 but actually we dont we didnt set out to be subversive we just did it because we liked doing it they said hey thats subversive and we said really ok
5810280 i thought politicians would be smart enough to treat comedians and satirists like court jesters
5810281 you let them do their thing and then you stand back and say of course i believe in freedom of speech look what im willing to put up with
5810282 thats one of our problems they feel the black youth is apathetic and we should be inciting them to take up arms or whatever
5810283 white liberals are happy to finance harmless african art movies
5810284 but they seem to get very anxious about ideas that might draw the attention of the thought police
5810285 and thats always funny it was also painful so there has to be a lot of comedy in there somewhere
5810286 like white racists with black lovers and morons trying to free mandela
5810287 you want to stop crime easy for six months anyone who commits any crime blam just blow him away pull a giuliani man i guarantee you crime will vanish
5810288 it would be entirely in character for him to laugh
5810289 learning to laugh at yourself is a great sign of human evolution
5810290 ah no a m que no me busquen porque no me encuentran
5810291 i kind of did this just to get out of prison and the prison mentality
5810292 i didnt realize i would enjoy it as much as i do
5810293 the problem is that when people leave prison after so many years they have nothing
5810294 some of them are sitting on their engines pumping water
5810295 i dont feel comfortable talking about this because it is a complicated issue for the brand
5810296 i dont speak about it to get paid for it
5810297 i speak about it because i love it i understand theyre a family restaurant but i think it cant hurt them to have a little spice
5810298 we cant forbid people from buying it im sure dom perignon or krug would be delighted to have their business
5810299 the question is do you have to love someone who loves you
5810300 the worst thing to do is turn off someone who is that passionate about you
5810301 a brand doesnt have to actively embrace someone like kendra but they should certainly be willing to accept the fact that shes willing to tell the world how much she loves them
5810302 generally speaking brands benefit from unprompted advocacy but every once in awhile there will be surprises its very difficult to manage
5810303 our position is that our team members as private citizens have freedom to participate
5810304 while were not endorsing the initiative were not making choices for our employees
5810305 i love the olive garden so much because i grew up going there
5810306 that used to be the place we would go for mothers day for birthdays my grandpa just died and right after his funeral we went to the olive garden
5810307 weve got offices across the state and a very robust operation
5810308 they are coming in early when its cheaper to be on tv
5810309 and they are determining if it will be worth it to push things in florida later on
5810310 its been a totally one sided affair but it hasnt bent the needle much
5810311 oh that feels good its really hot stuff cest magnifique
5810312 but this is a teenager that one day will become a very powerful man so you want to make sure he understands you that you are not just criticizing him every day
5810313 the united states is not at the peak of the game that puts us on a different playing field
5810314 the next time products come in the united states that are manufactured overseas and endanger the health and the well being of our citizens that will be the last of those
5810315 i want to tell you i will strictly enforce them
5810316 mccain has rich experiences in foreign affairs and national security areas as well as mature political viewpoints
5810317 if mccain can really become the next u s president he wont be a blank paper for other people to draw on in terms of the countrys foreign affairs
5810318 we could never have a leader like him in china
5810319 we track what you said you were going to do to what you actually did and that has never happened before
5810320 you got to the hotel and went for a 125 room instead of the 100 room you booked in the past companies would have no way of knowing that
5810321 corporate data managers are seeking data independent of their travel agency
5810322 if people are educated they want to make the right choices
5810323 they do push back particularly sales people who say i generate x millions of dollars and you squeeze me for 75
5810324 they are testing to see if a trip is really necessary
5810325 were finding lots of companies are lowering that to 1
5810326 we give them tools to take it as far as they want to go
5810327 i may have the feeble body of a woman but i have the heart of a king
5810328 if i felt stiff its because i was standing around too much the last couple days
5810329 were hopeful for the first game but its going to be close
5810330 its not an acl its not an operation its just rest
5810331 the taleban and al qaeda forces used heavy machine guns and other weapons they fired from mountains and gardens
5810332 theirs was a sacrifice not just for france but for all of us who want to help the afghan people build a better future
5810333 excuse me i like your hair where did you had it done

5810335 rmt members at tube lines are to be congratulated for the unity and commitment they have displayed during this dispute not least in the face of hostile media coverage
5810336 other times its like im not only sitting at my desk im also a few feet away watching me
5810337 ever since they started calling back the people in the bacteriology division for polygraphs they all sort of got quiet about things
5810338 injuries are a part of this thing and you deal with it
5810339 the young uns have to step up and play weve said that already and now they just have to do it for a while
5810340 we understand that we are young we understand that we dont have the experience thats all we hear
5810341 thats understandable and its true because we havent done anything in this league yet
5810342 you feel bad for bobby but its the nature of the business other guys get the opportunity to at least show what they can do show their potential
5810343 thats the way we looked at it thats the way bobby looked at it
5810344 theres no pressure added just go out and play football
5810345 we all realize that its now a great opportunity for a lot of receivers and with the situation were in now it kind of magnifies a little bit more
5810346 but our approach is to stay calm try and stay relaxed and not to think about added pressure
5810347 i honestly thought i was going to play defensive back thats what the coaches told me and what a lot of the guys wanted me to do but when i got there they were having a lot of receiver problems
5810348 thats all i remember is them saying were going to give you a shot at wide receiver and i was like ok i was just happy to be there
5810349 hes got great skill hes fast i mean his athletic ability is special
5810350 i wanted to see how charlie would handle a game going with our first string guys and then coming out after halftime and all the things you have to do
5810351 you need guys to shut people down out there and thats what he does
5810352 and the best thing is hed be there first to say hes got room for improvement
5810353 we all have an ego but he keeps his ego in check he cares about the team hes a hard worker hes the first one in line for all of our drills he tries to do it exactly like you ask him to do it hes humble hes hardworking hes just just everything you would want
5810354 and its time to go make plays on the ball
5810355 he went out in his contract year and had an excellent year
5810356 and were fortunate to sign him to a long term deal here which hopefully means he ends his career here that is sort of the right thing you know hes a local kid played at wazzu to play your whole career in the state of washington is pretty unique
5810357 i feel established but yet at the same time im working hard ive got to get better
5810358 he tweaked it a little bit in the game did something
5810359 i suppose theres a chance but we havent even talked about it yet
5810360 now look it if you ask matt hell give you the history of his back since he was 11
5810361 bobby is a very important part of what we do offensively
5810362 the young ins have to step up and play weve said that already and now they just have to do it for a while
5810363 no way did he think he was going to be in this position six months ago and now here you are
5810364 who knows he might be the starting center on opening day
5810365 at the moment i can say that 25 people have died in the attack
5810366 we have carried out the attack in retaliation for the governments actions in bajaur
5810367 ya que en internet puedes ser quien quieras en tanto en la realidad tienes que ponerte una m scara y ser lo que otros quieran
5810368 though commodity prices have come down significantly from record highs in mid july and the dollar has strengthened consumers can still expect to see increased inflation for some time to come as the producer price pressures feed through to consumer prices
5810369 the continued weakening of the housing market is an additional pressure and households will feel further squeezed in terms of real disposable income

5810374 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge
5810375 during these tough times some of our consumers dont want to be tempted as much as they have in the past
5810376 i dont think everyone will have the expectation that it will achieve those kind of levels because the market is very different now
5810377 its a pretty short timeframe so im not expecting it to have a big impact but theyre trying like everyone else to clear the 08s off the lot
5810378 but also because of higher gas prices and because the labor market is not as strong as it was 3 years ago theres not a lot of dry powder left
5810379 hey you look very familiar are you from so and so college
5810380 a little more john wayne and a little less richard simmons
5810381 a firmer dollar retreating commodity prices and continued economic weakness should damp inflation by the fall
5810382 the customer is very cash strapped right now and in some ways our greatest strength has become somewhat of a challenge

5810436 who created these laws there is no question but that a god will always be needed
5810437 i find it as difficult to understand a scientist who does not acknowledge the presence of a superior rationality behind the existence of the universe as it is to comprehend a theologian who would deny the advances of science
5810438 the significance and joy in my science comes in those occasional moments of discovering something new and saying to myself so thats how god did it my goal is to understand a little corner of gods plan
5810439 the white members of the group would disclose their insights and thoughts verbally and freely while the people of color would just sit and listen

5810450 this type of universe however seems to require a degree of fine tuning of the initial conditions that is in apparent conflict with common wisdom
5810451 the fine tuning of the universe provides prima facie evidence of deistic design take your choice blind chance that requires multitudes of universes or design that requires only one many scientists when they admit their views incline toward the teleological or design argument

5810480 what traditional deployment companies currently have in place isnt a solid business model for large scale nationwide and global rollout services that consist of hundreds or thousands of job sites you have to have a proven system comprised of a streamlined process structure unified rollout services model experienced internal resources and established partnerships to meet the needs of todays technology services industry
5810481 our customers count on us to be quick but at the same time provide a high standard of service quality and customer care
5810482 and thats exactly what our maestro technology rollout system does
5810483 at concert technologies we pride ourselves on our unique ability to integrate technology equipment and technicians to work together in a harmonious fashion at multiple sites nationwide or globally
5810484 we act as a conductor directing a concert which is how we decided on our name
5810485 theres a huge amount of research now showing people have a preference for attractive people from birth to death
5810486 babies prefer attractive faces and adults treat attractive babies better
5810487 our happiness levels seem to be pre set in life
5810488 good relationships can improve happiness but attractive people arent any better at them than others
5810489 we now know that free radicals similar to those in cigarettes are also found in airborne fine particles and potentially can cause many of the same life threatening conditions
5810490 this is a staggering but not unbelievable result when one considers all the diseases in the world that cannot currently be attributed to a specific origin
5810491 we now have evidence that these pfrs are pervasive in the environment and may exist in higher concentrations than most organic pollutants
5810492 yes i can see this happening someday exactly as bova outlines
5810493 after the attempted murder on tina she was told she would never be able to have children because of her injuries
5810494 so clearly her bond with the baby was very strong from the beginning
5810495 despite her own heartbreak she stuck to her agreement with her sister
5810496 this is going to be very good for all of the receivers not just roy and calvin
5810497 this is going to really open things up because teams are going to have to pay attention to the run and try to stop roy and calvin
5810498 when a team starts to be able to dominate the line and run the ball you can see the way it changes the chemistry and the energy levels thats what we have to have
5810499 the hardest part is all the practices without any games now that we have started playing games were almost home
5810500 two years ago every company had a story if you didnt like one on earnings then maybe you liked it for its business in china or for its credit card business so everyone was a buy
5810501 have you said that line yet were going to make a reel and its going to be the first thing on your reel that line
5810502 oh i want to know what happens oh i care about his guy
5810503 a bridge between creative people and talent seeker a portfolio showcase a medium for creativity to present your work to the internet audience
5810504 virga is a balloon 5 000 miles in diameter orbiting the outskirts of the vega star system built and colonized by humans thousands of years ago it is a weightless environment lit by man made fusion micro suns and one central fusion driven heat source named candesce
5810505 too bad we couldnt do that because its like world war ii its a huge canvas there to be mined
5810506 we could do a regular tv show a big one a half an hour show and it could really be great and we could use all the new techniques weve developed in cg animation and that sort of thing
5810507 when i finish star wars im going to go and start this and im going to do it
5810508 this is fantastic this is better than we ever imagined it would be and this is so good it could be a feature
5810509 why dont we just make a feature that introduces her as one of the main characters
5810510 well lets just forget that and lets go in this direction and force the style
5810511 look were doing a feature would you like to do the voice in the feature
5810512 could you come in in a month in four weeks and do this could we have two days
5810513 yeah thatd be great ill come in and do it
5810514 now i have to teach somebody and now i have to be slightly more responsible
5810515 rather than make it another guy why dont we make her a girl
5810516 key barriers to contactless adoption are low merchant acceptance unfavorable cost benefit ratios and low demand
5810517 we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
5810518 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5810519 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films
5810520 post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change we know harry potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
5810521 to keep them occupied and give them an outlet for privacy theyve been given these virtual reality modules
5810522 they each have a little corner to call their own and it can be anything they want it to be a place they can be alone they can do some sort of activity or be in some time period its whatever they want
5810523 six months into this voyage as theyre about to reach the point of no return fire up the big engines and head for the star theyre headed for something has started going wrong with these virtual modules
5810524 its something that will unnerve them and something that portends serious trouble down the road for this crew
5810525 we are in the room right now and mirrors mirrors
5810526 reflection on the glass the table the lamp just in this room i can spot 60 different reflective surfaces its everywhere mirrors are endless so you can find a million ideas
5810527 it was a direct adaptation of the korean movie then they showed me the movie and i said i like the story but its not very scary but i loved a couple of scenes from there i went back to fox and said if you want to work with me let me do a full rewrite and let me propose to you another story character and plot and if you like that movie lets make it if not go back to your script and find someone else i think they were really excited by what i brought them
5810528 it was the shining sutherlands 1990 flatliners and the exorcist
5810529 we had a big list and kiefer was really the number one choice
5810530 i thought ok what would be the worst thing my own reflection could do to kill me with my bare hands with no weapon or anything
5810531 then i thought about just putting my hands in my mouth and ripping my jaw off that became an obvious element that i had to put in the script
5810532 game is a sim world movie so you have a young kid who is controlling an avatar
5810533 they came out of commercials and out of doing second unit
5810534 mark neveldine was a hockey player which made him really good on roller blades so hed pick up these cameras and hed go down the street with the roller blades and somebody would be pulling him on a motorcycle and hed be getting these wild and crazy shots so they are visually aggressive thats what they are
5810535 if they use billy bob he will reinterpret the character and thats what you want you dont want somebody just copying me im very physical billy bobs not a physical actor hes a sound actor and an internal actor i think it will be very different
5810536 the uncanny common denominator in my recent work is that they were all first time directors
5810537 i did 2001 maniacs and i did hatchet with adam green and i did behind the mask for scott glosserman and i ran off and worked for my old pal bob keen up in canada and did heartstopper and then i came back and did jack brooks monster slayer and then zombie strippers theyre all first time directors
5810538 im trying to think whats been missing i think theres a younger generation now thats missing the fun that we used to have
5810539 it was like somebody had sent me the missing lost classic episode of twilight zone
5810540 it was this perfect black and white short film i called up my agent and said i gotta work for these guys they really know their stuff
5810541 i knew i was going to be mutating into this jabba the hutt meets ghostbusters creature and i was sort of the bridge
5810542 so i got to do a little bit of my nutty professor physical comedy stuff
5810543 that fact is one of the charms of this series
5810544 it could have been written 60 years ago and yet its absolutely fresh in what it does with basic scientific ideas that was very deliberate i wanted to say to the reader you dont need nanotech or indeed any new science or technology to write science fiction thats entirely original and mind boggling to boot theres life in old newton yet
5810545 so as a journey home with sword fights pirate sun is a deliberate cross between the odyssey and the three musketeers
5810546 i couldnt just leave them tumbling through the weightless air of virga so in that sense queen of candesce and pirate sun just wrap up the story begun in the first novel
5810547 in a bigger sense though i had so many ideas and settings and characters i still wanted to write about after the first two books that pirate sun would have been necessary even if all the plots had been neatly wound up i barely scratched the surface of this world in the first two books i wanted to show the reader that there were still many many wonders left to see there
5810548 virga is a whole new world a whole new kind of world for science fiction writers and readers to explore
5810549 ive recently completed the fourth book in the series the sunless countries and i can see no prospect of running out of fresh stories set in this place how many novels could innovate in this world more than i could write thats for sure i hope other writers will pick up what ive done here and run with it
5810550 im not really on the side of the spring breaker
5810551 the story of the movie is these prehistorical piranhas during spring break
5810552 its really about these crazy killer fish who are going to eat all these drunk kids and drunk bikini girls for me its the ultimate guilty pleasure movie
5810553 its like director joe dantes gremlins for adults theres a lot of gore its much more sexy i dont want to do something completely campy and phony i want to do something scary im walking on a fine line here because i want to have a lot of fun
5810554 i cannot say too much right now because we are really starting making the movie in time we will release designs there are many designs online that i dont know where they are coming from but they are not coming from us
5810555 its not based on the joe dante or james cameron movie at all
5810556 its a piranha movie there is absolutely nothing from those movies
5810557 it really pushed me to make this movie it gives the immersion factor more than anything else and it also gives that entertaining aspect
5810558 thats the way were going to get people back in the screening room and stop downloading movies is 3 d were going to make the movie experience such a ride that you wouldnt even want to download the movie
5810559 im working with vince pace who is not only the guy who created that great new 3 d but also best of the best diving wise and in the water directors of photography he worked on all the james cameron movies and hes really an expert on the water shots i hope together we are going to achieve every challenge
5810560 thats a huge part of my life and i really value that to kind of not consider any of the others joel schumacher and i you want to go make that go make that thats your right to do it but if youre not going to talk to us about it to do a cameo in that would be really disrespectful to something that i thought we made at one time that i thought was special
5810561 he had a great time making it so im glad about that
5810562 i found out after the fact i think i was in romania shooting mirrors when he did it
5810563 lost boys was a conglomeration of a lot of things
5810564 it was funny it was rock n roll it was cool looking it was scary at moments it was touching at moments between you know star and michael
5810565 god i havent said those two names for a long time
5810566 horror films or scary films are hard for me to watch
5810567 i can handle one a year its like getting on a roller coaster i flinched a couple of times watching mirrors once really badly and it embarrassed me
5810568 the script hearkened back to the films i really loved like the original amityville horror and my fathers donald sutherland remake of invasion of the body snatchers the shining dont look now the changeling the exorcist
5810569 those were all films that were rooted in characters the shining was a family going on a holiday so a guy could write
5810570 i choose films or stories and then i find a character that i can fit in that carson is this guy who is really down on his luck and is at the lowest confidence level hes been at hes been suspended as a police officer and in order to keep his family together he has to take a job as a security guard all of those things could be a normal drama and its a quarter of the way into the film before that stuff starts to reveal itself
5810571 just as an exercise i tried to spend one day without seeing my own reflection
5810572 i didnt make it out the hotel door i managed to get out of the hotel walked out the door and looked straight into the window of a bus and saw my reflection
5810573 he told me kiefer offers his best impressions of ajas french accent you had the greatest first line of a movie ever and i said what was that
5810574 the essence of what people can expect to find in igms both the anthology and the ongoing e zine is good old fashioned storytelling
5810575 youre not going to find high minded literary experiments or anything else along those lines there is a place for that in the world of short fiction youre just not going to find it in
5810576 once he decided to launch this magazine he just as quickly determined that it would be an online magazine because he felt strongly that he would rather see the money go to the writers and artists than to a printing company to print out copies
5810577 i have a lot of respect for the emphasis he has always placed on paying professional rates to the creative people
5810578 theres dave farlands mooncalfe which is a wonderful variant of arthurian legend theres james maxeys to know all things that are in the earth which is a post biblical rapture story told from the perspective of an agnostic scientist who tries to perform an autopsy on an angel theres tim pratts highly imaginative dream engine which im not even sure if i should classify as sf or fantasy and then of course there are the four stories orson wrote each set in the ender universe and exploring the backstory of some of the other characters in his famous series of novels about ender wiggin
5810579 i saw from the back cover that this was his first novel and decided to look at his web page he replied and noted that my area here in colorado springs might figure into one of his future novels something about norad or cheyenne mountain i forwarded his e mail to brian and suggested that maybe someday he might like to tour the mountain
5810580 it was like venturing into some kind of timewarp a journey to the place from which the apocalypse would have been monitored
5810581 but the most surreal part of it was to see on what hard times the place has fallen civilian contractors doing most of the work all the main operations transferred elsewhere and the base itself now on standby even so the whole thing was nothing short of awesome it was worth it just to ride the bus into the heart of mountain and see those gigantic blast doors
5810582 we understood nuclear attack and the weapons that might be deployed against us and built norad to look out for them
5810583 but it also highlighted to me how ineffective we are when the problem is more diffuse i write a lot about threats like unraveling ecosystems energy depletion and global warming and i cant help wondering if those might turn out to be our real blind spots its a bit of a pity that we never built a norad equivalent for environmental collapse
5810584 it was built by practical people for a very practical reason
5810585 theres very little frills in there its mostly machines on desks and a lot of plumbing
5810586 our guides explained that the infrastructure was designed and built by the u s navy and it shows
5810587 many of the sections within norad looked much like the inside of a submarine or a space station they maximized the available room with thin rooms and hallways across multiple levels
5810588 lifetimes of man hours were invested in the norad superstructure to deter soviet bombers that never came today the mission has evolved but it continues the tradition the dedication and the sense of honor are palpable i was proud to be there even for a few hours
5810589 i told them how this group has written about norad and cheyenne mountain in many novels and stories and that many of the writers were known worldwide
5810590 it was amazing to hear snippets ranging from what would happen if zombies or vampires were loose in cheyenne mountain to speculation on which floors were safest from electromagnetic pulses from the sun
5810591 the truth is that tour can be very long and very technical but somehow the group managed to be both entertained and entertaining the whole time
5810592 it was one of the most fun and interesting groups i have ever had the pleasure to show the mountain
5810593 it was an honor having them come for the tour their questions and comments were so awe inspiring that i am still fascinated i think that due to the subjects these authors write about their interest was much higher than a typical tour group thats a major reason for the tours success seeing many notepads being used i can only imagine the upcoming stories that will have norad and cheyenne mountain mentioned in them i wish all tours were this enjoyable
5810594 the man with the iron heart takes a look at the question
5810595 sometimes the fun house mirror of alternate history is an interesting way of trying to see where we really are now its also interesting to wonder how the soviet union remember the soviet union wouldve dealt with partisans especially after sponsoring so many during the war
5810596 there really was one but it started very late and had anything but unified command too many cooks often spoiled the broth
5810597 the one i chose was having reinhard heydrichs assassination fail so that he could survive and organize and lead the resistance
5810598 heydrich was one a cast iron son of a bitch two a capable cast iron son of a bitch and three a cast iron son of a bitch with rank enough to make the other high german officials take him seriously when he pointed out to them that the sky was falling
5810599 you need to remember that im also the guy who wrote both bedfellows about the boston marriage literally and metaphorically of w and osama and of news from the front which imagines a world war ii reported the way iraq has been
5810600 writers have viewpoints sure but finding them isnt always simple
5810601 my editor asked me for something from the world of my mercy thompson books and i told her that id like to write a story about a character who had only had a walk on part in moon called but was crying out for his own story
5810602 the result was alpha and omega in which i introduced readers to charles cornick and his mate anna after she read the story my editor asked me for a novel series based on the protagonist i didnt want to simply write an expanded version of the short story i dont like to mess with something i like because its too easy to ruin the magic of the story so i just continued the novel from there
5810603 abused in her last pack and out of place in montana she presents challenge enough for any hunter
5810604 just when hes starting to figure her out though he has to go back to work hes the troubleshooter for the pack and theres a rogue wolf hunting in their territory it shouldnt be a tough assignment so anna accompanies him a honeymoon of sorts but the rogue werewolf might be the least of their worries
5810605 mercy only knows the wolves from an outsiders perspective and anna and charles are wolves
5810606 i finally get the ghost story ive wanted since i scared myself silly telling ghost stories to my friends when i was in junior high school
5810607 were starting out with a four issue original story homecoming where readers can see how mercy ended up working as a vw mechanic in the tri cities
5810608 its the smithsonian institution in washington so there are a bunch of different museums which is cool we get to go to the air and space museum theres the national art gallery so there are paintings and photographs that we go into
5810609 amy adams is playing a statue of amelia earhart that comes to life so shes running around with me the whole time
5810610 theres a bad guy that hank azaria plays an egyptian pharaoh christopher guest is playing ivan the terrible which has been really fun
5810611 ricky gervais is back steve coogan is back owen wilson is back
5810612 its being shot at the moment and theyre about halfway through but my stuff comes right near the end owen and i do our stuff right at the end of the shoot because of the special effects
5810613 ive seen the script and i probably wont give too much away but i think stuff gets moved around somehow
5810614 i think sometimes stuff at museums is stored in places where theyre not being viewed thats part of it too
5810615 ark is the internet tv show that i just finished for judah sachs the show runners for the beverly hills 90210 show coming up
5810616 that has a sci fi element but this woman shes a heroine shes a schoolteacher and she is a survivor and i love characters like that

5810625 most u s banks heeded ffiec guidance and implemented stronger user authentication for their online banking customers

5810647 it sits on the shelf there as one of 50 projects that i have to deal with
5810648 its very hard to come up with stories for that thing
5810649 i dont know how much im allowed to say but im a very bad person
5810650 tim burton would have killed me if i hadnt done it because hes such a terminator fan
5810651 ive been in big movies before like apes and fight club was big in a different way and charlie and the chocolate factory and sweeney todd were big but ive never been in this kind of big popcorn action movie a male one an action one
5810652 gort is very much in the film and there are gort encounters though theyre handled differently
5810653 youll see him in the beginning youll see him early in the film
5810654 the role that he plays is a little bit more complicated than that so im not going to get into that
5810655 than him just being a universal cop hes still the heavy theres no doubt about that
5810656 10 20 40 other conceptualizations of gort and what we realized was that retaining an essentially human form was necessary because retaining the relationship between gort and klaatu was a necessity
5810657 it was a stylistic choice knowing that the time we were going to have and the speed we were going to move at i instantly knew that photorealism wasnt an area that we were going to go to
5810658 i talked to the crew and i talked to george about well lets just forget photorealism and lets go in this direction and force the style
5810659 and that happened to be what george really wanted to do we talked about sculpting with light and shadow and thats where you get the angles on the characters faces and i was aware and really afraid of the kind of lifeless cg that you can wind up with
5810660 hand paint a texture all over the characters which would somehow keep the spontaneity that an artist provides the fallibility you know a flawed feeling a little bit of painterliness on everything even right down to the eyeballs
5810661 i started with the plan to write a completely realistic novel about the first humans to explore mars but i couldnt get started writing it something was missing
5810662 i went out to new mexico because the arid lands of the southwest reminded me very much of the images of mars sent back by our spacecraft it was there that i realized my protagonist was part navajo a geologist whose father is pure navajo and mother a descendant of the mayflower thus was born jamie waterman mars the red world and earth the blue world symbolize the conflicts in his soul from that moment on jamies story just flowed out onto the pages
5810663 the idea that there was another intelligent race does not sit well with the ultraconservative religious groups that have taken control of the u s government
5810664 they try to shut down the mars project and jamie struggles to keep it going
5810665 ive worked very hard to stay abreast of the ongoing exploration of the red planet although i feel perfectly free to go beyond what is known today
5810666 for example no one can say that mars was not inhabited by an intelligent race millions of years ago well have to explore the planet much more thoroughly to find out if it once was
5810667 my own feeling is that knowledge is preferable to ignorance but there are plenty of people who feel otherwise
5810668 if such people gain control of our government we can look forward to a new dark age
5810669 when we started the project it was as george said initially a television series and we needed to be able to work at a pace that was pretty rapid
5810670 and the way that we write this is we rewrite we change it and we need to be able to access our actors pretty regularly so it was hard to get all the actors that would be off on set because this pace is pretty intense
5810671 and you cant really afford you know multimillion dollar actors to do a television series the license fee on your average television series is about 200 000 you know its nothing so those guys make more during their coffee break
5810672 we went back to the original actors and we said ok
5810673 they simply use them they have two days in the studio or three days in the studio and then they have like three weeks doing press
5810674 so theyre mainly paid for the press stuff theyre not really paid for doing the movie
5810675 well the basic premise about knowing is that its about a man who discovers a list of predictions that have accurately predicted all of the major disasters that have happened on the planet in the last 50 years and then there are three further predictions that apparently will come true
5810676 so its knowing the knowledge of whats about to happen and the responsibility that that entails
5810677 its a very small cast because its really about exploring the relationship between nic cages character and his son caleb played by a young lad called chandler canterbury
5810678 its about fathers and sons and its about the cycle of life and death and the hope that we pass down to our kids
5810679 i seem to always make science fiction mysteries and this is no different in that respect
5810680 i think the mystery genre and the science fiction genre for me go hand in hand i think also this film is about finding meaning
5810681 a man whos lost his faith in the workings of the universe and has to rediscover his understanding of whether there is meaning to his life so theyre quite rich philosophical questions and i think science fiction is a medium of ideas often science fiction movies are not so much a medium of ideas but i think from my point of view ive always tried to make films that are about ideas and philosophies more so than anything else
5810682 im co starring with tim dekay and we play ex husband and wife so theres a bit of friction between us
5810683 we have some unresolved matters and we try to resolve them during the course of yes saving humanity
5810684 shes sort of branched off and now what shes really trying to do is create artifacts that support her spirituality and her faith
5810685 she works more in the lab than actually on the locations which nicholas continues to do after they break up she believes that there is a god and that there are all these biblical characters who reveal and support that theres a higher existence and a significance to us all
5810686 and thats basically her battle with nicholas because he believes the opposite he thinks that he has to have the proof to have any faith and they constantly go back and forth about this within the film and they each have their moments where their point of view changes so its a nice character subplot between us that tim and i loved working with
5810687 well i think the difference on xena was that xena lucy lawless in a way was always pragmatic
5810688 it was about getting the job done and gabrielle was more about the open heart about trying to save everyone the difference i guess in monster ark is that i think my character ava she wants to save her ex husband she wants to save him so it is very similar gabrielle wants to save xena and ava wants to save nicholas and we save the world
5810689 the cambist and lord iron a fairy tale of economics
5810690 the evolution of trickster stories among the dogs of north park after the change
5810691 i wanted to write a book about emerging pathogens ever since i read richard prestons nonfiction book about ebola the hot zone
5810692 ive also wanted to write about arab culture since i lived in tunisia for a year when i was young but i dont know enough to write from the point of view of an arab or in an arab setting my fbi agent tessa sanderson mahjoub is the widow of an arab which lets me bring in an american view of that complex and fascinating way of life finally in 2003 i got a dog a tiny and very spoiled toy poodle and the pieces fell together in my head
5810693 the cdc is called in they suspect some sort of brain virus or environmental toxin
5810694 fema throws a quarantine around the town and the tyler animal control officer with newly deputized help begins rounding up dogs this is a difficult job because some people do not want to surrender their pets others want to see every dog killed immediately before more children die one of the new deputies is an ex fbi agent who has newly moved to tyler with her dog and she begins to find herself implicated in the outbreak in ways she could never have foreseen
5810695 aliens land on the moon communicate with us and announce that 10 000 years ago they committed a terrible crime against humanity and are now here to atone
5810696 however they wont tell us what the crime was they insist on showing us via 24 human witnesses sent by the aliens to different planets to report back to earth the novel follows four of these people and what they discover is shocking multilayered and capable of changing the way humans see the universe
5810697 theres no reason why we necessarily have to use the same three or four that are still around
5810698 i mean batmans got a wide variety a rogues gallery certainly we used two in the first movie that hadnt been in the films before
5810699 its really up to chris to decide and he has not decided whether or not he wants to go back to the well again
5810700 and if he does i you know would be honored to work with him
5810701 when we did star wars episode iii revenge of the sith i lamented the fact that i had to jump over the clone wars
5810702 and i jumped over the clone wars because it had nothing to do with anakin skywalker
5810703 using anime and manga and those kinds of ideas that ive always wanted to work in
5810704 that sort of got me going to say you know we could do a
5810705 in a universe that is not restricted and therefore not quite as dark
5810706 we can have a lot more fun with it we can enjoy it its just a little bit more lighthearted
5810707 i think what readers read the story for is because they want to watch and follow characters that they love and hate
5810708 they want to be with those characters and follow that story and know whats going to happen exactly what those characters do isnt as important
5810709 if the characters are great characters and you want to journey with them the story is secondary
5810710 every time i do a new book thats like saying a new book couldnt possibly work because the readers read the previous book and why would they read more stories about the characters its the characters that are important
5810711 but i think the vast majority of fans their greatest hope and desire is to see the hero and heroine they love brought to life on screen
5810712 i was fascinated by how she entered the story as a fully formed spiritually oriented leader and wondered how she started her journey
5810713 sissy the protagonist of the novel grew out of my own spiritual quest her story evolved from there
5810714 it is ruled by a tightly controlled caste system everyone knows their destiny and their place in society as dictated by one of seven genetically engineered caste marks
5810715 as the caste system and society on harmony begin to break down from within as well as from invasion from the c s s and their enemies the maril sissy rises above her worker caste beginnings to become high priestess she must either bind her world back together through her prophetic visions or tear it apart in outrage at the implied slavery of the caste system
5810716 but she bears all seven caste marks something unheard of
5810717 she hides her anomaly as best she can but she cant hide her prophetic visions nor her unique bond with the planet and their goddess harmony
5810718 writing it was an organic process that amazed me with every unexpected plot turn
5810719 the sequel presents its own unique challenges but the story is there inside the characters its up to me to excavate it many fellow writers and friends helped me with the research most of the answers were just a question away
5810720 this picks up shortly after the end of harmony and continues sissys search for explanations about herself her home and her religion in the broader context within the c s s
5810721 harmony is so much more than just a caste system harmony is the energy that binds the universe together but can she find it without the anchor of the planet harmony
5810722 i wanted to develop a character that would help anakin settle down
5810723 i happen to have a couple daughters so i have a lot of experience with that particular situation
5810724 and i said rather than making it another guy why dont we make her a girl
5810725 there was the idea that maybe the sith apprenticed a new one after darth maul and that she would be a girl
5810726 that got abandoned eventually in favor of count dooku and christopher lees character
5810727 it just so happens that we introduced ahsoka at the same time
5810728 so here you had these two new girls coming into this story at the same time which was actually theres kind of an advantage to it because you had one thats the apprentice of anakin skywalker trying to be trained in the traditional ways of a jedi and you had one thats the hidden apprentice of count dooku who was the evil opposite end so that actually works really nicely for the stories were trying to tell
5810729 and people can really relate to that because anyone growing up who got picked on either theyre too tall too short had crooked teeth doesnt matter what it is they see he is a victim of society society has kind of rejected him and hes accepted it and wants to be left alone and now theyve come in on him and invaded his area and now hes fighting back so its almost kind of like yeah i wish i could do that my boss is a jerkface i cant do that but jason can do that and they can kind of live through him in a fantasy sort of way
5810730 hes not accepted hes the outcast and a lot of people in different aspects of their personality can relate to that
5810731 people are going to be like what jasons doing martial arts thats bullcrap no he doesnt its just my background its basically based off of whats in the script and then something brand new hes a functional jason like how would you be if you lived in the woods by yourself for so long youre not going to be extremely muscular extremely well fed the idea is basically he lives off the land and the movements from time to time i would do little homages to some of the guys whove played jason before me in alternate takes i dont know if theyre going to use it or not well see because i havent seen the final product but just giving respect to the guys who have come before me but all in all ive kind of done my own thing
5810732 we want to tell in a very consistent style this great epic fantasy that terry has created
5810733 sometimes rob would break and make a funnier version of xena or hercules but we wont be doing that here
5810734 there is a great deal of humor in the books but its different for instance the character of zedd is a very funny character but the show will be very serious and straight well let the humor come out of the characters in the exact same way that terry did and that will translate directly to the screen
5810735 ive recently been in contact with roger and hes actually working on the script right now
5810736 i think that from a progress standpoint its probably gone a little bit slower than what we would have expected you cant control these strikes and so on
5810737 i had a plan all along an epic story arc that really does wrap up
5810738 its very exhilarating to see it all tied up in a big climax and resolution like running a very long marathon im raising my hands for a victory lap but also feeling sad to have it all over
5810739 hes the leader of an alien empire that is at first kindly toward humanity falls in love with a human woman but then finds himself trapped by politics so that he is forced to betray the human race in order to save his own
5810740 everything is intertwined one race clashing with another and nothing is totally black and evil
5810741 im already diving headfirst into my next big project an innovative fantasy trilogy called terra incognita and brian herbert and i have an original sf series called hellhole a few years from now i might want to go back to the seven suns universe with a new storyline maybe revisit some of the old characters but it would be completely stand alone not an oh wait i need to do another sequel type of project
5810742 i like a canvas where theres room to paint whole cultures and ages long conflicts
5810743 i also just published another sf epic the last days of krypton telling the pomp glory downfall and destruction of supermans home planet i guess i like to destroy things on a very big scale
5810744 we shot it in june and we find out i think in mid august glenn gordon caron i knew he was so talented from all of this projects hes made but working with him i was more and more in awe of him as the days progressed which is usually not what happens he was just so wonderful to work with that i hope it will become a series
5810745 she wakes up in this in between world thats not heaven or hell
5810746 its sort of this next place you go its sort of this master control realm theyre giving her an orientation and she meets this person who ioan gruffudd plays and shes basically told that shes dead and has this new job now helping people on earth straighten out their lives shed led a very frivolous life and shes not the kindest of people so when she dies she realizes there is something to be said about being a good person
5810747 i am an angel who comes back to earth but its not touched by an angel by any means
5810748 when i was talking to glenn about this he said it was a romance that it was heaven can wait meets brazil
5810749 a good film is very hard to make whatever kind of film it is because it has to go beyond whatever genre it is to make it a great film period its about telling a great story thats intriguing that builds that builds the characters thats multidimensional and is going somewhere interesting and i think also for horror films there are only so many scary horror films you can make
5810750 growing up to me poltergeist was terrifying the amityville horror and the exorcist were terrifying those were the three that i was scared by as a kid
5810751 i wanted the character and the situations she faced to be very normal
5810752 my thinking was that the horror aspects of the story would become more terrifying because of the connection the reader felt with the character
5810753 the town is sort of on the verge of being a ghost town with empty houses everywhere
5810754 she hates it there but shes stuck with the help of a new friend she begins to notice that there are some freaky things going on in that place
5810755 these arent the roving rotten flesh kind that only exist in the movies
5810756 these zombies are beautiful popular but very dead and they want hannah to become one of them
5810757 they use blood from the living to maintain their own appearance of being among the living
5810758 i know some people are purists but i like the idea of reinventing these universal monsters i think it keeps them terrifying if they keep evolving but rest assured my zombies are still the flesh eating homicidal creatures that everyone is familiar with
5810759 prior to writing it id lived in new york city for 10 years
5810760 i relocated to the middle of nowhere about a year before writing zombie blondes there was a quite a bit of culture shock going from manhattan to the woods of a small town there was something scary about these secluded little towns and i worked that into the book
5810761 i noticed that a lot of horror movies relied on quick camera cuts and musical score to create tension
5810762 i had to spend some time trying to figure out how to achieve that effect in writing
5810763 were definitely having to get just the bare minimum this year
5810764 you can really see that people are looking at the value
5810765 im buying them less and theyre not getting to pick out much this year
5810766 the shoes on me are getting tighter and the shoe prices are going up so she cant afford the shoes
5810767 the company is entrusting some of its most important work software for new payment products fraud detection and help desk assistance to the austin technical team
5810768 financial institutions generally dont discuss their inner workings with competitors but in the case of fraud and crime communication and collaboration are invaluable
5810769 we see members of the fraud alert network posting comments like i have been through this and heres how to fix it the level of dialogue is refreshing and absolutely necessary in the face of mounting fraud activity
5810770 wait im running a very cost effective operation what is the incentive for me to get people to start using their cards
5810771 there isnt that much difference between online bill payment and online purchasing

5810943 in this years great energy debate democrats describe a future when the u s finally embraces the anything but carbon avant garde it turns out however that when wind and solar power do start to come on line they face a familiar obstacle environmentalists and many democrats only last week duke energy and american electric power announced a 1 billion joint venture to build a mere 240 miles of transmission line in indiana necessary to accommodate new wind farms yet the utilities dont expect to be able to complete the lines for six long years until 2014 at the earliest because of the time necessary to obtain regulatory approval and rights of way plus the obligatory lawsuits
5810944 according to health canada there is no evidence to support the belief that bottled water is any safer than tap water indeed if anything our tap water may well be safer and healthier than bottled varieties the municipal water supply is more stringently tested than bottled water supplies in canada the cbc reports that local water supplies are inspected every day while bottled water plants are inspected just once every three years in addition according to msn news water bottling plants are required to test for coliform bacteria just once a week whereas most municipal water systems test for the bacteria several times a day
5810945 according to the pacific institute the energy required to produce plastic water bottles for the american market alone in 2006 was equivalent to more than 17 million barrels of oil and created 2 5 million tons of carbon dioxide producing bottles consumes a huge amount of water too with the pacific institute estimating it takes three litres of water to produce one litre of bottled water

5810974 the specter of an oil spill ruining new jersey beaches is keeping state officials from even considering the potential benefits of what could be
5810975 there were five gas finds in the eight wells off new jersey i would call them somewhat significant
5810976 with todays prices they certainly would be much more attractive now should new leasing occur a big if obviously companies probably would go back into that area and try to find additional gas discoveries
5810977 miller said the threat from an oil spill damaging beaches from 90 miles out to sea about 70 miles past the horizon that can be seen from shore is overblown given modern technology the danger becomes even more remote if drilling for gas which dissipates if it reaches the surface he said
5810978 most oil spilled into the sea is from ships or from loading and unloading ships not from drilling rigs
5810979 republican john mccain is scheduled to make it today to an oil rig in the gulf of mexico to promote his energy policy and bash democratic rival barack obama
5810980 much has been made of the reported profits of oil companies the implication is that bib oil is ripping us off
5810981 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost
5810982 we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
5810983 i am convinced we need to consider natural gas as a transitional fuel i am intrigued by the pickens plan developed by t boone pickens the billionaire oilman from texas the plan promotes a massive expansion of wind power and the substantial replacement of oil with more environmentally friendly natural gas

5811002 if nothing gets passed well the sunset on the congressional moretoreum will expire and then let the drilling begin
5811003 either she nancy pelosi is so arrogant to think that nobody would find out that she is profiting by holding up new drilling and refining initiatives or she thinks nobody can touch her
5811004 specifically nancy pelosi has a couple thousand shares in clean energy fuels corp which is t boones company that sells fleet natural gas refueling services right now the stock has been doing ok especially when compared to the rest of the market google finance chart of clne since inception
5811005 this means that pelosi could have purchased around 20 000 shares at 3 86 or 50 000 to 100 000 worth which are now worth 300 more than their original value nancy pelosi says that she is trying to save the planet and prevent global warming but the reality is that according to disclosure statements in may 2007 she invested in t boone pickens clean energy fuels corp clne which is the sole sponsor of a proposal in california to funnel 5 billion in state funds and 5 billion in federal funs to this corporation which will indirectly help them create a giant wind farm in the texas panhandle an overlooked story in november of 2007 shows that the t boone pickens plan involves the private control of water which pickens wants to be able to sell to big cities via giant water pipelines which will be built on land seized under eminent domain
5811006 i tried that here yesterday the flames came from all sides
5811007 more than half of the republicans have come back to this chamber leaving behind obligations and constituent meetings to come back and talk about the number one issue and that is energy we are doing all we can to say congress should come back and finish its work
5811008 good heavens woman this is a war not a garden party
5811009 the technology of the drilling industry may have improved but offshore drilling is a dirty business and it still leads to oil spills due to failed equipment aberrant weather or human error on a frequent basis
5811010 you wouldnt see any full production out of any oil drilling off the coasts until 2030

5811015 first and foremost nearly all of the articles avoid calling georgias action on aug 7 what it was a clear act of military aggression by georgia directed against the residents of south ossetia and the russian peacekeepers deployed in the region the result is a humanitarian disaster hundreds of civilians dead many of them russian citizens tens of thousands of refugees and the destruction of many villages and the capital of south ossetia
5811016 what is at work here is a neoconservative self fulfilling prophecy in which russia is turned into an enemy that ramps up its largely reduced military and putin is cast as the new joseph stalin bogeyman evoking images of the old soviet union
5811017 mikheil saakashvili georgias president has stated that unless we stop russia unless the whole world stops it russian tanks will go to any european capital tomorrow adding on a separate occasion that its not about georgia any more
5811018 it is clear that georgia wants this dispute to become something more than a short if bloody conflict in the region for decision makers in the nato countries of the west it would be worth considering whether in future you want the men and women of your armed services to be answerable to mr saakashvilis declarations of war in the caucasus
5811019 it my be a better invetsment to advise georgias govt not get drawn into such conflicts in the first place
5811020 id like to ask them whether obama would have given his 17 year old mother impregnated by an apparent sexual near predator the same advice he says hed give his daughters namely not to let herself be punished with a baby

5811041 why not pick up a rifle and lead the way tough guy
5811042 the nature of the exercises and attempts to present them as anti russian as well as the involvement of countries from outside the region cannot but provoke certain questions and certain concerns why was the black sea basin chosen for the drills

5811060 we have been trying to go back to our main previous activities the most important step was the opening of the school we have made it possible for the teachers to find openings for profitable trade
5811061 to unknown from ayman al zawahiri folder letters date may 3 2001 the following is a summary of our situation we are trying to return to our previous main activity the most important step was starting the school the programs of which have been started we also provided the teachers with means of conducting profitable trade as much as we could matters are all promising except for the unfriendliness of two teachers despite what we have provided for them we are patient this apparently refers to an internal dispute with two senior london egyptian islamists as you know the situation below in the village egypt has become bad for traders jihadis our upper egyptian relatives have left the market and we are suffering from international monopolies conflicts take place between us for trivial reasons due to the scarcity of resources we are also dispersed over various cities however god had mercy on us when the omar brothers company the taliban here opened the market for traders and provided them with an opportunity to reorganize may god reward them among the benefits of residence here is that traders from all over gather in one place under one company which increases familiarity and cooperation among them particularly between us and the abdullah contracting company bin laden and his associates the latest result of this cooperation is the offer they gave following is a summary of the offer encourage commercial activities jihad in the village to face foreign investors stimulate publicity then agree on joint work to unify trade in our area close relations allowed for an open dialogue to solve our problems colleagues here believe that this is an excellent opportunity to encourage sales in general and in the village in particular they are keen on the success of the project they are also hopeful that this may be a way out of the bottleneck to transfer our activities to the stage of multinationals and joint profit we are negotiating the details with both sides
5811062 we have been trying to go back to our military activities the most important step was the declaration of unity with al qaeda we have made it possible for the mujahideen to find an opening for martyrdom as you know the situation down in egypt has become bad for the mujahideen our members in upper egypt have abandoned military action and we are suffering from international harassment

5811076 ayman al zawahiri leads a busy terrorist organization and he must solve practical problems for example he may want some al qaeda members to blend in and live in the united states if these men wore full beards and went to ultraconservative mosques to pray they they would arouse suspicion and get put on a watch list instead al zawahiri would want these operatives to go undercover and blend into society however these devout muslims will not go undercover unless they believe they have permission to do so from the teachings of islam as a result al zawahiri wrote a booklet titled covert operations which goes deep into islamic teaching and history to describe how deceit can be a tool in muslim life
5811077 hiding ones faith and being secretive was allowed especially in time of fear from prosecution of the infidels
5811078 al zawahiri specifically gave radicals permission not to pray in the mosque or attend friday sermons if it would compromise their position

5811082 the manhattan raid led to a radical change in the perception of american security after the northern half of the continent had been isolated from the rest of the world and its threats by two oceans it now came from inside the surprise hit the symbols of american power in its economic and security dimensions
5811083 the anthrax scandal over many months there was an excited search for the person responsible for the worst biological terror attack on american soil six letters sent by mail to leahy daschle tom brokaw dan rather the new york post and the offices of the national enquirer in florida led to the sickening of 18 people and five deaths the crime was especially scary because anthrax which is a complex powder that scatters in the atmosphere had spilled from the envelopes and spread through parts of the mail system and contaminated a senate building one year later the main post office in washington had not yet opened the fbi is under great pressure to close this case and the anthrax criminal is supposed to be alive and free two members of the senate have asked to receive regular reports about this investigation from the fbi and they have become increasingly impatient
5811084 until the investigators find material evidence that connects a person to the crime they are forced to speculate about the motives and methods of the criminal they are still casting a wide net law enforcement sources say they have issued hundreds of subpoenas and they are analyzing thousands of documents in search of new evidence the evidence may be small and unseen sweat or an odor on an envelope but that is all that they need in order to attract the dogs
5811085 the most startling revelation from this intelligence success story was that the anthrax program had been developed in parallel to 9 11 planning

5811087 rest assured my daughter has nothing to do with al qaeda or any other organization
5811088 make too much noise about aafia if you want her to return safely

5811090 you will be astonished to know about the activities of dr aafia siddiqui
5811091 a woman with children wearing a hijab driving a volvo
5811092 is that how al qaeda is recruiting now at playgrounds
5811093 the fbi says the information from those early investigations is classified
5811094 the fbi often fans sparks into flames but it looks to me like khalid shaikh mohammed knew enough about her to know her name it wasnt jane doe or jane smith that does strike me as odd
5811095 decided to focus on developing a solid growth medium for cultivating b anthracis that might be usable in the field with a minimum of equipment they further developed the growth medium for use at room temperature thereby obviating the need for equipment such as incubators for sustaining an elevated temperature

5811098 aafia siddiqui was here boston in june 2001 when some press reports suggest she was in liberia meeting with atef says the familys attorney elaine whitfield sharp
5811099 its critical to use a genetically complete strain of the anthrax bacterium in experiments involving virulence
5811100 the question was whether current events would convince federal officials that the researchers skills are in the national interest or make them restrict workers from certain countries
5811101 it is a horrible feeling to think that it could be someone i know that the perpetrator is a microbiologist among us
5811102 there is no way they could have helped her get access to the necessary labs at the med center
5811103 id be happy to talk to you but id like to have my attorney present
5811104 i do this all the time as soon as there is a lawyer in the picture they have to play by the rules
5811105 we will talk to you we are watching you dont leave town
5811106 once there was counsel involved attitudes changed dramatically laws started to mean something
5811107 to brother mohammad alsiddiqi we are facing a lot of problems because of you fear allah mr siddiqi there is a day of judgment you will be asked if you are very busy with something more important dont give promises to other people see you in the day of judgment still waiting khalid shaikh and bojinka
5811108 was in possession of a perfume spray bottle which contained a low concentration of cyanide when he was arrested
5811109 the detainees pocket litter included a letter from unidentified saudi arabian scholars to usama bin laden the letter discussed al qaidas strategy in the war on terror
5811110 was the first time a government department has been targeted in this way
5811111 an initial analysis of the envelope revealed some traces of bacteria
5811112 anytime you pick something up like this and it seems to layout the whole story for you months or years before the fact your immediate response is to step back and say whoa something may be going on here
5811113 our attacker may very well have used this report as something of a if not a template then certainly as a rule of thumb
5811114 the letter was prepared by putting bg spores in the center of a sheet of paper folding it over into thirds placing the folded sheet into the envelope and sealing using the adhesive present on the envelope the envelope was then shaken to mimic the handling and tumbling that would occur during its passage through the postal system
5811115 in addition the aerosol would quickly spread throughout the room so that other workers depending on their exact locations and the directional air flow within the office would likely inhale lethal doses envelopes with the open corners not specifically sealed could also pose a threat to individuals in the mail handling system
5811116 it is certainly relevant data but i dont think it would have altered the decisions that we made
5811117 i infer from the nbc report that from the isotope ratios authorities believe either that the anthrax was grown in one of the yellow or perhaps light green areas but not one of the dark green blue or red areas on ehrlingers map
5811118 then he said he had to look at a lot of samples that the fbi had prepared to duplicate the letter material
5811119 the fbi has narrowed its focus to about four suspects in the 6 1 2 year investigation of the deadly anthrax attacks of 2001 and at least three of those suspects are linked to the armys bioweapons research facility at fort detrick in maryland fox news has learned among the pool of suspects are three scientists a former deputy commander a leading anthrax scientist and a microbiologist linked to the research facility known as usamriid

5811121 spared no effort in its attempt to obtain biological weapons in 1999 al zawahiri had recruited another scientist pakistani national rauf ahmad to set up a small lab in khandahar afghanistan to house the biological weapons effort in december 2001 a sharp wmd analyst at cia found the initial lead on which we would pull and ultimately unravel the anthrax networks we were able to identify rauf ahmad from letters he had written to ayman al zawahiri we located rauf ahmads lab in afghanistan we identified the building in khandahar where sufaat claimed he isolated anthrax we mounted operations that resulted in the arrests and detentions of anthrax operatives in several countries
5811122 the first significant and meaningful information on what al qaida may at some point have hoped to achieve in the area of bioweapons appeared on a single page in the journal science in mid december 2003 and then in declassified documents that were obtained in the last week of march 2004 appended to the single page in science via the internet address was a list of thirty two items eleven books and twenty one professional journal papers nearly all dating from the 1950s and 1960s dealing with pathogens or bioweapons
5811123 they were found in al qaida training camp near kandahar afghanistan in december 2001
5811124 bw initiative included recruitment of individuals with phd level expertise who supported planning and acquisition efforts by their familiarity with the scientific community
5811125 if it should turn out as is currently assumed that the amerithrax perpetrator came from within the us governments own biodefense program with access to strains laboratories people and knowledge then all previous conceptions about the significance of the events would be substantially altered
5811126 al qaeda has actively recruited educated college graduates and specifically sought individuals with particular knowledge and training such recruiting patterns do not automatically translate into either an interest or capability in bioweapons but they would be a key advantage should the interests of such a group turn in that direction as 1999 memorandum quoted above suggests they may
5811127 disappointing representation from important institutions in the world of hazard levels 3 and 4 organisms
5811128 the tall thin and bespectacled scientist held a doctorate in microbiology but specialized in food production according to u s officials familiar with the case
5811129 presented a comprehensive overview of this model pathogen describing its unique biology and specialized molecular mechanisms for pathogenesis and high virulence he went on to describe modern approaches to exploit new bioinformatics for the development of potential medical counter measures to this deadly pathogen
5811130 he was detained for questioning and later the courts determined there was not sufficient evidence to continue detaining him
5811131 if there was evidence that proved his role beyond a shadow of a doubt we would have acted on it but that kind of evidence was not available
5811132 his sources now say that soviet intelligence routinely obtained details of work at usamriid that went beyond the descriptions in scientific journals
5811133 another former soviet scientist told the sun that his lab routinely received dangerous pathogens and other materials from western labs through a clandestine channel like the one kouzminov described
5811134 a scientist once based in a soviet bioweapons lab in obolensk south of moscow
5811135 said that by the early 1980s his colleagues had obtained at least two strains of anthrax commonly studied in detrick and affiliated labs they included the ames strain first identified at detrick in the early 1980s
5811136 if you wanted special materials you had to fill out a request
5811137 and essentially those materials were provided how and by whom i cant say

5811141 one sunday in november 1998 meet the press viewers watched as secretary of defense william cohen told that iraqs saddam hussein was trying to develop a massive biological and chemical weapons bcw capability cohen set a familiar yellow bag of domino sugar in front of him and noted that just that amount of anthrax could effectively poison the water supply of the city of new york
5811142 cohen wanted to garner public support for air strikes against hussein in retaliaton for his refusal to permit un inspections of suspected production sites for bcw cohen did something else entirely however he reminded the people of their vulnerability to biological and chemical attacks a vulnerability that today seems absolute
5811143 to date there has been more heat than light on the subject of the bcw threat it is all too early to let ones imagination run so far and so fast that the standard problems of security appear insurmountable
5811144 in a democracy such as ours there is no substitute for open and honest dialog about the impact of what we do on our laws and our values without that no leader can pursue a coherent strategy confident of the support of the people
5811145 no one would suggest the us become fortress america in order diminish the bcw threat no matter how grave yet improved intelligence in countering the threat does raise uncomfortable questions
5811146 the human assets likely to be involved in bcw intelligence may be even more unsavory can we stomach those associations

5811197 democratic party is a party of inclusion we respect the individual conscience of each american on this difficult issue and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party
5811198 so what are they saying that because we want to protect the rights of the unborn our own party says were automatically republicans this has to be one reason that our party is having trouble appealing to many people in churches

5811201 strongly and unequivocally regardless of ability to pay oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine
5811202 you dont have to take a different stance about a womans right to choose but you begin with the need for reducing abortion dramatically
5811203 taking abortion seriously as a moral issue would help democrats a great deal with a constituency that is already leaning in their direction on poverty and the environment there are literally millions of votes at stake

5811232 if such demonstrations continue i think we will have a bill for the president to sign soon the more debate the more demonstrations the more likely we will prevail
5811233 i support ron paul for president because we share the same goal that of overturning roe v wade he has never wavered on the issue of being pro life and has a voting record to prove it he understands the importance of civil liberties for all including the unborn
5811234 our goal is to secure as many delegates to the national gop convention in minneapolis st paul as possible

5811275 if you dont have a target you will hit it every time
5811276 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost
5811277 seems to be talking out of both sides of his mouth
5811278 mccain in my personal opinion has more experience on foreign affairs than obama and has served in the military i think thats important
5811279 we paid a lot of money for them i hope you enjoy them
5811280 i cant talk im finally about to get my seventh continent out of the way and once i get on the boat to antarctica cell towers become a rare commodity
5811281 all the way through a texas night sure i might tell work so my little excursion doesnt leave me jobless upon my return
5811282 if we had shifted our fire for effect to the limits of our weapon systems similar to the georgian side the city of gori would no longer exist it would be wiped off the map just as the georgians wiped tskhinvali off the map
5811283 stressed some cases of inadequate behavior of russian soldiers in this town
5811284 i wonder should we have acted following the example of the georgian side how would the international media and political elite see it
5811285 absolutely legitimate and flawless both under russian and international law
5811286 we dont want to destroy the nato russia council but russias actions have called into question the premise of the nato russia relationship
5811287 the keys to the city the kids are in charge
5811288 delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
5811289 if this isnt an issue made for pawlentys sams club republicans i dont know what is
5811290 its my third olympics but its also going to be my last olympics its kind of a farewell at the same time i get really excited but really emotional about it a lot
5811291 really got into church and gods word and was really excited about it
5811292 diving was the only stable thing i had in my life
5811293 i didnt think i was going to survive the meet
5811294 i was so disoriented and i was terrified i realized in the middle of that meet that id taken control of things and everything was slipping through my fingers i had just made a mess of stuff
5811295 he gave me this talent and i want to worship him with it and glorify him with it i know i dont have to win to do that whatever place i come in hes going to be glorified through that if i honor him i want to be a graceful winner and i want to be a graceful loser
5811296 i would say shes larger than life but thats not the first thing that comes across when you meet her shes a real person very humble about all of that stuff
5811297 the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night
5811298 i had to win everything i took part in to maintain my self esteem i was angry at god for allowing her to die and often viewed my life as unfair
5811299 during my teenage years i felt a great need to leave new zealand and explore the world i wanted to be in control of my future i wanted popularity money and fame i thought a running scholarship to america was my ticket to happiness
5811300 all i had achieved was nothing compared to missing my mother blaming god if he even existed for her unfair death
5811301 in depression i felt like i had nowhere else to go i needed guidance and a direction with real purpose
5811302 jesus showed me how we can live life to the fullest
5811303 rather than seeking money or power he chose to help feed the hungry and heal the sick jesus lived a perfect life never deceiving or hurting anyone many people started following jesus and cheered that he would become their new king
5811304 the leaders in power became fearful of jesus so they decided to have him killed jesus did not run or hide but chose to accept this fate
5811305 the coolest thing about jesus is that although he was the son of god and had the ability to do anything he still allowed the soldiers to nail him to a cross his innocence has now made it possible for all of us who are guilty to be forgiven and set free from our sin
5811306 he came into my heart and swept me clean all the anger and bitterness towards my mothers death became healed and i was ready to restart my life fresh
5811307 god is real and he walks alongside me every day he convicts me when i stray and loves me when im lonely nothing i have done during my life has allowed me to deserve this my selfish existence is proof that god can and wants to forgive everyone we just have to ask
5811308 jesus is not about religion he is a living god who wants to be a part of our lives he knows we are messed up and struggle with different temptations he wants to help free us so we can enjoy life to the full not live a boring life following strict rules and regulations
5811309 running with all my heart is a way for me to thank god for the opportunities and gifts he has given me
5811310 as i train for the olympics i constantly remind myself that all i have comes from god and without him i would not be the person i am today
5811311 whether i win or lose i believe that god gets great joy when i approach my training working and racing with an attitude of power love and discipline
5811312 i also try to adopt this same view when it comes to other areas of my life besides running
5811313 when we were in africa we didnt know what was there for us as kids we just ran
5811314 god was planning all of this stuff for me and i didnt know
5811315 weve continued to race whether theres 700 on the line or now olympic glory on the line
5811316 its something we do because we love it but now to finally have the kind of recognition and to put us on the world stage is something that we really cant even describe right now
5811317 weve all had numerous new sponsors and tv time that weve never had before
5811318 but i dont think until we walk into beijing and are then truly a part of the olympics will we realize how big this thing is
5811319 we watch what we eat we have to train every day were totally conscious of the responsibility that we have to be role models to the kids
5811320 ive always wanted to be the best and its kind of a great time now to educate parents and kids of new generations about this sport
5811321 it kind of made me realize that theres no reason why i shouldnt be giving my life to the lord
5811322 bmx as a sport is not really one where you see a lot of christian athletes speak out about their beliefs
5811323 i understand that everything that ive been given and been allowed to do is because of christ i dont think of anything that i do as being something that ive done on my own
5811324 im thankful that god has allowed me to have that success
5811325 an unhealthy relationship on an emotional level with a female member of his staff
5811326 to refrain from all public ministry for a season to receive counsel in his personal life
5811327 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study
5811328 yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
5811329 godly leaders are supposed to protect the sheep from heresy
5811330 not spoon feed deception to them only god knows how far this poison traveled from lakeland to take root elsewhere may god forgive us for allowing his word to be so flippantly contaminated
5811331 anyone who is in services 4 to 6 hours a day 7 days a week for weeks on end is bound to have some type of breakdown
5811332 anyone who covers himself with tattoos while in the ministry raises questions about his stability
5811333 anyone who talks about the angel of the healing revival that ministered to a a allen and william branham must have overlooked the fact that allen and branham both were discredited with moral shortcomings anyone who baptizes people in the name of the father the son and bam is playing lightly with the holy spirit and is bordering on blasphemy
5811334 perhaps some of the problems would have been prevented if men had spoken into bentleys life several months ago
5811335 as good as it is to have an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff to help the injured it is much better to have a fence at the top of the cliff to prevent someone from going over
5811336 there is a dynamic that makes charismatic leader situations sometimes treated differently and it is partly tied to the very term charismatic
5811337 because this person is perceived to have charismatic power or anointing his or her failure in marriage is often easily forgiven and overlooked
5811338 john hagee of cornerstone church in san antonio divorced his wife of 15 years in 1975 and the next year remarried but his ministry and influence only grew in the years after that richard roberts son of oral roberts also divorced his first wife after 11 years of marriage and 10 months later remarried paula white and her husband randy divorced last year it was paula whites second marriage while these divorces have had ramifications for their ministries in every case the ministry only flourished afterwards in most other evangelical traditions the impact of divorce has been more deeply felt by the ministers in question
5811339 we do not know all the details of bentleys marital situation and so we should withhold judgment on that matter
5811340 what is plain is that he is teaching false doctrine and that the claims to his ministrys successes seem pretty spurious
5811341 i spoke with a very influential swiss pentecostal theologian and pastor a few years ago walter hollenweger who had invited branham to zurich to hold meetings in the early 1960s
5811342 he said branham pronounced scores of people to be healed of their ailments but a half year later not a single one of those persons was actually healed and many had died branhams personal charisma had carried him and i suspect something similar is happening with bentley
5811343 i decided i needed to make a change and i turned to god
5811344 bryan credits two things with getting his life back on track his success in sports that led him to college and his belief and acceptance of the christian faith
5811345 at azusa pacific university in southern california bryan really began to accept the christian faith that his mother had been trying to instill in him for many years
5811346 no longer a troubled teen he is now a devoted christian that has an incomparable work ethic a commitment to excellence and an unwavering integrity
5811347 a huge reason why i havent been tempted to take drugs or do anything of that sort is because i realize that winning is not my life its not my identity
5811348 i know that god has me doing what im doing i know that yes i can win i also know that im not going to win all the time and i know that either way win or lose that god is going to provide for me
5811349 if you want to walk on water youve got to get out of the boat
5811350 delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart
5811351 i especially got into their promotion of teaching women about safe sex and about not being afraid to carry condoms
5811352 one of the things i tell them is most men are just going to be really happy to be there in the first place so dont be afraid to insist on safe sex every time
5811353 the stock market climate in the last nine to 12 months has held us back but now we no longer have the concerns of a listed company and can use de agostinis financial resources for growth
5811354 our swedish and nordic companies will gain access to more rights and bigger formats and we will have bigger budgets to produce content its incredibly important for us to invest more in developing our own formats that can be successful internationally
5811355 in the longer run we will benefit from increased resources for future growth
5811356 zodiak has achieved a solid position in the television content production sector with an appealing geographic coverage thus representing an attractive strategic fit for de agostini
5811357 the acquisition forges a new capability for keycast as mekoteknik specializes in machining the types of castings that keycast produces
5811358 the acquisition adds crucial new capabilities but also enables keycast to improve customer service expand its customer base and access new segments of the market
5811359 mekoteknik and keycast already have an established relationship with mekoteknik having machined for keycast for a number of years adding the capabilities of mekoteknik to the group will help keycast serve its customers more efficiently and effectively as well as increase the development of new products
5811360 dongsheng demonstrated that it needed new solutions and had the financial resources to initiate a full scale project they agreed to let us test the technology in a new residential area
5811361 we were skeptical to begin with but now that the construction has been modified it is all working fine now to live in this region in the long term we have to regulate water consumption we just have to put up with the initial inconvenience
5811362 i am an old man and i grew up using wood gas
5811363 it seemed suitable to start using it again now when the fuel prices are so high
5811364 hydropower and access to forest biomass are two of the main reasons we have such a high proportion of renewable energy
5811365 new potential in growing markets such as renewable energies and mining and materials handling
5811366 cmon you dont want to get beat by the fat guy do you
5811367 was never about discrimination against patients on the basis of sexual choices it was about discrimination against healthcare professionals on the basis of their sincerely held ethical standards
5811368 taking away the first amendment rights of healthcare professionals puts at risk the rights of every working american
5811369 is insufficient to allow them to engage in such discrimination
5811370 californias compelling interest in ensuring full and equal access to medical treatment irrespective of sexual orientation
5811371 will deny physicians and other professionals the ability to freely exercise their religious convictions
5811372 by forcing healthcare professional to choose between conscience and career we will lose doctors nurses and other healthcare professionals who are already in short supply
5811373 all things to all people so i may by all means save some
5811374 dont believe her i watch her every day she doesnt live like she is telling you
5811375 right now i am loving being single im not put off marriage in the future i really enjoyed the ritual of marriage and i dont think of divorce as failure
5811376 i am very happy right now in my single womanhood im enjoying the company of different kinds of men i am sure i will want a relationship at some point but right now im really taking time for the recovery process
5811377 one guy paid me 5 000 to make a film where another girl hits me in the face with a cream pie if you have never taken a cream pie in the face it is the best thing ever its pee your pants funny the most fun you can have sober
5811378 you dont need to be a cutting edge individual to enjoy the burlesque hour
5811379 one thing about the burlesque hour is that it has been loved by so many audiences young and old theatre and non theatre goers straight laced to high heeled the show has had such a diverse appeal people should take a punt
5811380 it takes your breath away and then theres something completely sexy and silly
5811381 for the very first time we saw the old theatres of london and something happened to us we thought our work needs to be in a place like this
5811382 so we came home with that idea of putting the old and the new together
5811383 theyd get fantastic dancers to do an amazing ballet or an incredible singer that would bring you to tears because her voice was so beautiful and then there was always something a little bit edgy like a naked lady
5811384 people have said oh youre out to shock people but that would be extremely arrogant if you think that you can shock the audience you assume that you are infinitely more worldly more sophisticated and politically on the ball than them and thats not necessarily correct we assume our audiences are really intelligent and open
5811385 we considered a few options when we were putting it together including a barbie doll
5811386 but i thought that would be a bit uncomfortable the strawberry is lovely to work with if you think about the shape its the perfect fit
5811387 a perfection of 30s 40s and 50s burlesque i love the music and the era
5811388 the dancing and clothes the style fits my body type
5811389 its a function of several things the aging of the traditional population the birthrate of the newer population the immigrant population but also the growth of the hispanic culture not just in the desert southwest but across the united states
5811390 all of these social forces are coming to a head and were going to see by 2050 a dramatic shift in the rest of the country
5811391 but for those of us in southern california its happened look at the san fernando valley what theyre projecting for the rest of the country has already transpired in los angeles
5811392 if we think that politicians are starting to pay attention to latinos and latino communities now you aint seen nothing yet
5811393 virtually across the board were going to see increasing demands for more equitable distribution of power and power arrangements in and beyond california
5811394 i think the children of first and second generation americans tend to work harder than those who have advantages handed to them
5811395 and i look forward to seeing what kinds of education advances hispanics are making at midcentury
5811396 its not a question of what kind of people its a question of how many people
5811397 we use far more resources per capita than anyone else in the world a small population increase here is worse than a large increase in population elsewhere so unless we get a handle on our energy so that were doing it in a sustainable way i dont see how the world can afford us
5811398 on the one hand it has developed a kind of tolerance that is a majority way of thinking
5811399 if we want to make sure that we have a high quality work force that meets the needs of an increasingly globalized economy
5811400 we need to address the needs of our public schools so that the young people have the skills they need to replace the baby boomers
5811401 we need to begin planning to meet the needs of a growing population as well as in many cases begin to maintain the systems that we built many years ago that havent been properly maintained over time
5811402 this conflict is very much about proving who is the bad guy
5811403 at the moment there are no other drugs that prevent leukemia relapses
5811404 in the study we did to test the drug 70 percent of participants were able to return to work while receiving treatment
5811405 ceplene could mean an awful lot for individual patients in practice it offers a cure for the disease
5811406 hey there muscley arm why the long face do you like popsicles theres a freezer full of them in my basement why dont you run down and grab a few
5811407 son muy fuertes f sicamente y eso en el agua se nota
5811408 russia is very seriously wounded diplomatically its like a lets say wounded bear that the civilized world is trying to keep from taking certain steps and on the contrary put it to sleep or calm it down so that ultimately what wakes up in russia is some other kind of creature not the bear that has been showing its teeth these past days in a manner no one would have expected from a country that claims to be civilized
5811409 from our standpoint it seems it would have been better for nato to take more radical steps but all of this will definitely yield a result it is just a matter of time hours and days before russia starts retreating
5811410 russias only concern now is to somehow save face as it retreats
5811411 they are telling russia once again it is the 21st century and in the 21st century such behaviour cannot be tolerated just because you have more tanks more missiles and a lot of barbarians whom you can make invade someone elses country it is unimaginable that the world to put up with russia drawing lines where it wants to draw lines russia today has neither the strength nor the authority nor the resources to determine the order of the world russia cannot determine the order of the world today
5811412 russia is extremely nervous about issues concerning its image because these image issues are often linked not only to psychological factors which often cannot be explained but rather russias economic interests which are in large part connected to the west all the money that enters russia today comes from its energy contracts with european countries and with the west as a whole
5811413 did not expect such a severe reaction from the rest of the world such solidarity with and support for georgia
5811414 everything will be fine as long as we are calm and united
5811415 georgia will emerge from this situation stronger than it was before
5811416 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5811417 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5811418 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
5811419 he was trying to cross the bridge when a russian soldier at a checkpoint opened fire for no reason he was shot twice in the chest and once in the head we buried him the same day my father died fighting for the red army in the second world war and i served as a soviet guard on the turkish border i had never harmed russia why did they murder my son
5811420 we have come here from our village five kilometres away which has been destroyed look at this can one live like this in the 21st century thank god the russians did not let the ossetians in but where is the georgian army and the georgian government we have russians driving around in tanks in our city
5811421 the russian troops have been very kind they give chocolates to children and cigarettes to the men we are now afraid of what will happen if they leave we think the ossetian militia will simply come in and there will be trouble
5811422 we do not believe the trouble is over it is frightening at night and we can hear gunfire in surrounding areas we need international forces here as soon as possible
5811423 we are exhausted and we have not got enough supplies we dont know what we will do if more patients appear
5811424 what kinds of losses will russia suffer following attack on georgia
5811425 it is hard to understand what russia has on its mind
5811426 russia has traditionally preferred to be feared rather than respected putin had always emphasized that russia was not viewed as a force to be reckoned with to the same degree as before
5811427 aside from ambitions and the anti caucasian sentiments there were economic interests of course russia has always considered the georgian system of transportation of energy resources to be a problem and it is naturally interested in disrupting its operation
5811428 as for the fact that this conflict could create tension between powerful states or even trigger a cold war russia itself has excluded all the options except for a cold war and this is not the wests fault
5811429 the west turned out to be quite patient it has been suggested that the west did not think that something like this was possible in the 21st century everyone is guilty of having over optimistic expectations when you walk into the same trap several times it is not just the fault of the one who laid the trap because it shows that you did not plan things properly either
5811430 our most important objective is to return to the situation that we had before the conflict and to retain those positions so that a peaceful settlement of the conflict becomes possible it would be counterproductive to take thoughtless and hasty steps in this process and to focus on pr campaigns
5811431 it would be best for georgia if the conflict did not start at all we should be first and foremost concerned about the consequences of the conflict rather than the possible dispute between russia and the west and their gains and losses
5811432 the most serious problem is that as the area between the russian and the western positions is narrowing we could find ourselves trapped between them if there are some people who think that the third world war should start in georgia they are definitely out of their minds georgia will not benefit in any way either from a cold war or a hot one it would be very dangerous for us to secretly celebrate the start of a new conflict between the west and russia and to hope that we could benefit from it somehow
5811433 apparently russia hoped that the attack on georgia would be followed by chaos anarchy confusion and possibly substitution of the georgian government with a pro russian puppet regime
5811434 russia was in a hurry to make this move because it saw that georgia and ukraine had a realistic chance of joining nato
5811435 following the latest developments this possibility has pretty much transformed into a reality the eu has now mentioned the option of substituting the russian peacekeepers with its own peacekeeping force both the united states and the osce support the idea
5811436 as for the implementation of the proposal it will require a un security council resolution
5811437 russia faces a choice either it will make concessions accept the international communitys proposals and stop the campaign of aggression against georgia or it will find itself isolated from the civilized world which involves political and economic costs
5811438 unless russia changes its general foreign policy strategy towards neighbouring countries and takes a more constructive stance there is a very strong chance that a new cold war will begin
5811439 it should be embarrassing for russia that no one has supported them except for the president of venezuela and the leaders of the hamas terrorist organization
5811440 russia has found itself isolated not only on the international stage but also within the cis
5811441 as for the military aspects of the situation russia has suffered a fiasco in this respect too
5811442 i am convinced that the question of speeding up georgias and possibly ukraines admission to the membership action plan will be raised at the nato meeting on tuesday
5811443 accelerating the process of georgias and ukraines accession to nato would be an appropriate response to the regional and international security challenges that have arisen since 8 august
5811444 i have consulted all legal experts my political supporters with their advice i have decided to quit
5811445 appreciates president musharrafs efforts in the democratic transition of pakistan as well as his commitment to fighting al qaidah and extremist groups
5811446 looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5811447 we have 700 men here do you think any of them beat their wives chances are they do the most devout christians beat their wives many of our bishops come from places where it is culturally accepted to beat your wife
5811448 because the revival of cold war rhetoric is seen as an asset to the neocons lauria also reminds us that mccains chief foreign policy advisor and registered foreign agent for georgia is randy scheunemann whom lauria calls
5811449 so shes like the wind in the sails of your erection
5811450 the most important thing is not to win but to take part
5811451 first event to kick off 2008 backyard olympics is the relay race mom sounds off and the race begins everest is off like a rocket amazing look at that kid run he makes it around the house in lightening speed time edison in position bent over one leg in front of the other head down and hand stretched behind him for the passing of the paper towel baton everest slides the baton into his hand flawlessly and edison snatches the baton up while taking off rounding the first corner effortlessly and with legs of phenomenal speed isaac now waiting for the baton to be placed in his hand you can see the excitement in his face he is in his element edison comes tearing around the final corner of the house and lands the baton square in isaacs hand as isaac tears out of there and off he goes little hudson takes a deep breath steps up to the mark with confidence and waits isaac is flying hes got sparks under his heels as he comes in behind hudson and passes the baton dead center in hudsons hand hudson wraps his fingers tightly around the baton and just as he accelerates slips oh my landing smack on his belly but wait hes up with no hesitation this kid is up and back in the race wow this kids amazing look at him go he just might have a chance at a medal oh wait hes taking the lead look at those legs go hes going for gold and he takes it what determination the moll team wins the gold what a team effort purely unbelievable
5811452 with little time to cool down they are in place for the next race it is a tough line up of events for the evening however the moll boys are up for the challenge if anyone can pull it off its these four young men right here next is the 40 sprint to the slide and the 80 sprint to the slide and back followed by the 200 marathon then moving into the standing long jump followed by the running long jump or hop for some the rest of the nights lineup proves to deliver excitement and entertainment what thrills chills and spills it doesnt get any better than that folks this is athletics at its best
5811453 the big driver will have to be policies that encourage investments in wind generation systems and break down barriers
5811454 utilities who dont meet the standards pay a monetary penalty
5811455 the goal is not to capture the entire upside of asia but to provide a more stable profile that investors can stay with over time
5811456 he says it wont solve our problem and that its quote not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5811457 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5811458 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5811459 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5811460 live nation benefits from the difficulty of replicating the live experience that casual and passionate fans pay for in good times or bad
5811461 started with control of the venues then used that to spread out into other areas of the music industry and by so doing its competing with the record labels
5811462 if live nation can get to the point where its paying on parity to what the labels are paying or even below that then it will be a great strategy
5811463 madonna is not getting paid 120 million upfront the money is getting paid out over ten years and thats only if she performs
5811464 we are not going to speak about fannie and freddie
5811465 i talk with europeans i talk with asians and i talk with the people in latin america
5811466 it is important that they understand what is going on in the markets
5811467 if we get the economic issue right with china it will help us get all of the other issues right because economics is so important to china
5811468 takes the warning letter very seriously and is actively working on providing the information requested by fda
5811469 after mr cantrell died i took a little old mule he had and plowed me a vegetable garden and had plenty of vegetables to eat it was hard times you had to work to eat
5811470 ive worked hard my whole life and did what i had to what i could to survive i didnt want to talk about it for a while because i didnt want people to gossip about it i didnt want people to make it out to be worse than it was
5811471 the party and the government are dependent upon the assistance and wisdom of the chinese people we are capable of successfully holding the olympic games and we will be just as successful at bringing about reforms so that the international community will congratulate us on our democratic culture
5811472 elections montana may decide to bar contractors doing business with the state from making political donations to state lawmakers
5811473 what they are signing now we dont see as what serbia has insisted on
5811474 a profoundly new reality in which unmik can no longer perform as effectively as in the past the vast majority of its tasks as an interim administration
5811475 the new agreement which is purely technical in nature allows eulex to deploy a lot of people whereas before we didnt have that ability
5811476 we are still in discussions with unmik on how best to transfer authority but we are trying to do it as unofficially as possible
5811477 as with every similar provocation this technical move cannot be ignored and the government will submit a protest to the security council you cant go about it this way
5811478 i think this is the way forward that has to be supported by opponents and supporters of kosovos independence alike
5811479 people expect an official transfer with a ribbon cutting and all that but eulex will be able to work once they are all here
5811480 its not perfect and its not easy but it is moving forward and there is room to look for space to find common ground
5811481 a s we walked up the stairs i did wonder medically and otherwise what or who i would find and then i saw him
5811482 i dont know where im going to get the money for new shoes
5811483 a blue room for the boys and a pink room for the girl
5811484 we had a fight through the night and it is ongoing
5811485 isaf forces on the base had before identified a group of insurgents posturing to attack the base and engaged them with small arms fire
5811486 helicopters arrived on station soon after and engaged these insurgents as they attempted to flee from the scene
5811487 three of the insurgents killed themselves by detonating their suicide vests isaf forces killed three other suicide bombers before they could detonate their vests there were no isaf casualties in the attack

5811490 carboncopypro is hands down the simplest way to make money online these guys are constantly improving their marketing system to stay ahead of the competition i could not be happier about starting this new business
5811491 surprisingly most agencies are excellent at connecting their clients to their client
5811492 make sure that your complete contact information is in your salutation including your direct line and cell phone it
5811493 a poor gatekeeper can cost you business during my most recent review i called 18 agencies and asked for the name and e mail of their new business person seven out of the 18 agencies or roughly 40 wouldn
5811494 if you make it difficult to connect with it is easy to find other options
5811495 if my reviews get leaked to the press agencies are like sharks in the water with wounded prey in it
5811496 he got a bootleg copy of our video from a friend who wouldnt shut up about our presentation and he wanted to see what all the fuss was about
5811497 we received an email from him saying that he watched our quattro video and made changes to his web sites that added an extra 6 700 in profits a day for him thats 2 million more a year with no extra marketing cost so he wanted to buy us a beer
5811498 the good news is anyone can watch the video he credits with making him 2 million dollars and they dont have to buy us a beer
5811499 the war for wealth the true story of globalization or why the flat world is broken
5811500 musharrafs participation in the war on terror and the cooperation of the intelligence agency with the united states were to put it mildly never popular in the country moreover he was only ever half hearted in his fight against the militant islamists sometimes ruthless sometimes conciliatory the coalition government is strategically unsure of itself and seems to want to secure an end to domestic terror through deals something that the increasingly bold islamists wont thank them for but will simply use to increase the areas they control in light of this situation the west in general and the us in particular must do more about pakistan than before it must prevent the nuclear nightmare of islamists gaining access to atomic weapons
5811501 it needs to become clear to the pakistani leadership that when they take on militant islamists they are not just doing the west a favor they are also helping to develop their own country the belief that the fall of the kabul government and the return of the taliban would be a strategic victory over india is a fantasy from previous centuries allowing islamism to flourish politically militarily socially and ideologically cannot be in the interests of most pakistanis their interests lie in achieving economic stability and the west can do more here too
5811502 the west should take the opportunity of musharrafs resignation to encourage a policy in islamabad that combines international dependability with development and democracy the preconditions for long term stability
5811503 the assessment of the american intelligence agencies is that the risk of an islamist take over is very low the us government never saw the promotion of democracy in pakistan as the main task washington depended on the army to keep the country under control ashfaq kayani the new us trained head of the army since january has musharraf to thank for his career he first made him head of the isi intelligence agency and then his successor as the head of the army he now determines the scope within which the parties and democracy can operate
5811504 nevertheless with musharraf going a scapegoat is disappearing from the stage one whom afghan president hamid karzai and when required the americans could blame everything on they could claim that more
5811505 karzai and his backers will soon need a replacement for musharraf his resignation does not mean that the pakistan army will go on the offensive against the pashtun tribes in the border regions the problems there anyway cannot be solved by military means they can only be fixed with dialogue and development aid
5811506 in addition the pakistanis civilians and soldiers have no interest in a stable afghanistan in which its archenemy india is increasing its influence encouraged by karzai every conflict in this region that pakistan is involved in has to be seen through the prism of its enmity toward india
5811507 musharraf had a vision he wanted to put his country on the path toward the turkish secular model and saw himself as the pakistani atat rk however the dream of a secular pakistan is probably dead
5811508 he failed because of the countrys poverty the fatally high birth rate the boom in the price of natural resources the divide between the islamists and the secular part of society the politicians ambition and his inability as president to find a consensus across the board and to step down at the right time by the time he took off his uniform his second skin it was already too late
5811509 pakistan is more important than it seems a nuclear armed state not tied in to arms control with conflicts on both sides fragile internally on the new frontline between the east and the west pakistan after musharraf is the cause for much worry in global politics
5811510 the fact that the dictator is finally stepping down presents pakistan with a unique opportunity now the democratic structures can grow in those regions and parts of society that had been left in a vacuum by repeated dictatorships and it is only in these political vacuums that fanaticism can take hold
5811511 pakistan is now facing a period of political instability perhaps even a period of chaos on the streets it is doubtful if the divided coalition which was so busy in its efforts to have the president impeached that it forgot about the really urgent problems facing the country will now be able to find the necessary unity to prevent a power struggle pakistan is ill prepared for life after musharraf
5811512 the fight against the taliban must be taken as seriously as reviving the economy it is only if pakistans government and future president apply themselves to solving these problems and manage to fight against corruption and inefficiency that the country can free itself from the vacuum that is looming and achieve a fresh political start
5811513 the west absolutely has to contribute to this musharrafs close ties to the us may not have pleased many people in the country however without the americans help the country would have been left helplessly in the grasp of the islamists the best thing the us administration could do now is to use its influence to make sure that democracy in pakistan is not smashed in a power struggle pakistans nuclear arsenal must never be allowed to fall into the hands of extremists
5811514 the developments in pakistan affect important western interests one is the question of what policy the country will pursue with regards to the taliban which is launching its war in neighboring afghanistan from pakistan another is the issue of pakistans nuclear weapons which must not be allowed to fall into the wrong hands and then there is the potentially extremely dangerous ongoing conflict with its larger neighbor india which also has nuclear weapons
5811515 after sept 11 2001 musharraf decided admittedly under extreme pressure from washington to allow the fall of the taliban which had been long been backed by his own foreign intelligence agency since then pakistan has been a part of the international alliance against islamist terrorism musharraf also more the father of the islamic nuclear bomb who had been secretly selling nuclear know how and technology to dubious regimes around the world
5811516 these strategic decisions were and remain extremely important to the west with the dictators departure there is now at least a theoretical chance that the democratic forces in the country will come to an arrangement with the army which will put a stop to the rise of the islamists in the border regions a return to the times when the army was openly in cahoots with the islamists would be disastrous
5811517 after musharrafs departure the west can now prove that it wants to bring lasting peace to the region

5811519 california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education
5811520 it is apparent however that independent study is permissible only when offered by the public school system and supervised by a certificated teacher
5811521 i have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling the team effort was remarkable
5811522 tens of thousands of california parents teaching over 166 000 homeschooled children are now breathing easier this afternoon
5811523 over time these trends could play out in several different ways with different effects on peoples lives
5811524 applications like twitter or mig33 a mobile based social network service rely on the ubiquity of mobile phones
5811525 infotech advances are also enabling more involuntary transparency as seen by the 45 of us parents who use internet monitoring software to track their kids online activity
5811526 since users are never out of touch with their friends coworkers and or peers their activities and locations can be tracked indeed many services market their transparency features as a selling point
5811527 its hard to imagine anyone getting their day off to a good start when they have to wake up to the hideous sound of an alarm
5811528 and then all most people have to look forward to is commuting to a job that they probably dont like or arent satisfied with ill take being woken by my daughter over that any day no question
5811529 in the past things like my mindset and thoughts were just never even a blip on my radar
5811530 it turns out my lack of happiness was a direct result of that
5811531 its great to start the work day by being energized by a community of people who are all about living life to the fullest a life without limits it just puts you on track to achieve great things
5811532 when our economy is taking such a hit why wouldnt you want to be involved in an industry that is flourishing
5811533 there are a lot of really unhappy people in the world who just want more out of life we not only offer products that can help them get there but we can also teach them the same marketing system that we have used to gain our freedom which can then facilitate dramatic changes in their lives its a no brainer
5811534 its a shame it really is just recently i saw several of my former coworkers lose their jobs to an outsourcing initiative if you follow the news it seems like there is a similar story every day
5811535 that is major reason why i made the decision to learn how to make money rather than how to earn it i didnt want my livelihood to be at the mercy of someone elses whim besides it is much more fun to get paid what im worth rather than what my employer thought my job was worth my days of trading time for money are long gone
5811536 people know whats going on they know that no matter how good they are the fact remains that their jobs are expendable
5811537 there is no more safety in corporate america and unfortunately career stability is a thing of the past offering a person the ability to take control of their success by providing them with a proven system that includes ongoing training and mentoring by self made millionaires is just something that most people want
5811538 it is great where else can you start a legitimate business have it up and running in a matter of days and have the ability to be profitable and recover all of your upfront costs within the first few months
5811539 i didnt want to wait that long to see a profit and i certainly didnt want to trade one job for another
5811540 it is great to have the ability to not only the help empower others so that they can change their lives but to also be able to lead them and teach them the same system that has allowed me to free myself
5811541 there is nothing better than giving someone the key to unlock their potential we give ordinary people the ability to achieve extraordinary things
5811542 this is the most incredible line up of business experts ever seen in one tv series and it is worlds apart from other existing business tv shows like dragons den and the apprentice for the first time ever the million dollar team is being put to work on real business problems for real businesses and businesspeople worldwide can watch it all unfold and apply the learning
5811543 its a fantastic example of whats possible online it would be virtually impossible both in terms of cost and logistics to get this team together for any one business so we know this show is only going to continue to grow in popularity with viewers
5811544 we are thrilled to add a person with such expertise and record of success at building companies and building brands to the firm mr van deusen
5811545 his experience in consumer package goods medical devices and pharmaceuticals aligns with many of the important growth segments that contributed to our recent 50 increase in revenue
5811546 i am delighted to join the talented passionate team of professionals at congdon company
5811547 the opportunity to positively impact the financial performance of a business through stronger brand strategy and design has never been more crucial than in today
5811548 congdon company has successfully grown over 25 years by staying focused on a passion for brand strategy and design and by continually exceeding expectations with big ideas keen insights and extraordinary execution these principles will continue to drive our future growth
5811549 hes been very truthful and to me thats the only way you can find common ground
5811550 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them
5811551 russia does have interests and at some point theyre going to stand up and draw lines that are not simply to be ignored
5811552 the claim that this process is not directed against russia will not suffice
5811553 it definitely wasnt what i would call a look into your eyes and see your soul meeting
5811554 thats all it took just a few days of very heavy thunderstorms
5811555 when no agreement was reached at the meeting the businessman and his partner allegedly killed him in the meeting room and disposed of the body
5811556 when i last saw him in april 2007 he told me he regretted the sale he wanted to cancel everything then he suddenly disappeared
5811557 berlin is avoiding any kind of confrontation because germany has no lever to exert pressure
5811558 with its attack on georgia russia has shown the west that it doesnt intend to change
5811559 russias own people is bombarded with propaganda just like stalins day but what is the reaction of the neighbors and of western europe so far it seems as if old europe is above all scared of the aggressor and still hopes for a savior to take power in the kremlin
5811560 russia is a state that is unfortunately using the one tool that it has always used when it wishes to deliver a message that is military power
5811561 the hope had been that russia was going to build its foundation and relationships with europe and the united states on the basis of russian economic political cultural and other kinds of assets
5811562 and reminding people that bears can fly near norway or near alaska and that you can use military force against a small neighbor is not a particularly appealing message or image
5811563 an attack against this memorial is clearly directed against homosexuals that can be said without waiting for further police investigations we must show our condemnation of this act of intolerance and homophobia
5811564 everything suggests that this attack was motivated by a hatred of homosexuals
5811565 the attack shows in a drastic way how necessary this monument is hostility to homosexuals remains virulent the kissing scene shown in the monument evidently hit the mark even in a democratic society there are people who cant stand the sight of men kissing in public
5811566 i had feared something like this would happen people dont learn theyre much too stupid unfortunately because they dont want to understand that there is such a thing as homosexuality because they dont want to accept that there are people who are naturally different from them
5811567 the minister didnt have any alternative other than the air force standby service to make her appointment in time
5811568 the air force standby service is a good way to transport government members to important meetings in exceptional circumstances
5811569 a one hour flight with a cougar helicopter costs around 5 300 if our politicians take these flights to hold speeches these costs should be born by the governments budget rather than the armed forces budget
5811570 when you dance you generate energy by the shaking of the ground
5811571 what we do very simply is to capture the movement of dancing people and transform it into energy
5811572 one club wants a green roof so maybe well put solar panels up there or grow things put up little windmills who knows
5811573 doing something is better than doing nothing but to earn the label sustainable dance club you have to do more
5811574 everyone is free to open an eco club or dance club the thing was that he was using our concept and we didnt have a second conversation with him
5811575 telling people that they can save the world by flying to an island to party is a green con
5811576 human power is on a totally different scale from solar or wind energy because of the modest amounts produced and the obvious fact that humans cant work out 24 hours per day
5811577 we think that 21 to 35 year olds the group that we focus on are the next decision makers in line
5811578 so if we want to have a quick change we have to focus on them

5811607 we are committed to a safe and secure event in pakistan
5811608 our desire is to ensure that every stakeholder is content with arrangements and is comfortable with the icc champions trophy taking place in pakistan
5811609 he mendis is a bit different and the batsmen need some time to settle in
5811610 said the indian skipper the five match series starts in dambulla on august 18
5811611 its tough to say anything right now but we know what he have to do we know our abilities and are quite confident
5811612 after a long time we have two match winning spinners we now have more attacking options
5811613 murali has now got the support he needs and there is also support for vaas its quite a relief for a captain to have such an option in mendis for us it is always a team game
5811614 we are not complacent because we know the one dayers are a very different game we are confident with the way we are playing and have to make sure we execute our plans as we did in the tests
5811615 it is always difficult to replace him tendulkar as he contributes not only with his batting and bowling but also comes out with brilliant suggestions
5811616 weve been playing some good one day cricket we were number one in the world earlier this year and were a proud nation
5811617 for us to come over here and win a test series and a one day series in england would be a big achievement and were all really keen to do that
5811618 ive tried to keep myself fit during my time off and played a couple of games for durham and then after that club cricket but adapting to international cricket again is going to be my big challenge irrespective of the conditions
5811619 getting used to the intensity that international players play at again is going to be my biggest step
5811620 the rest of the guys one day specialists have been busy back home and they might be a bit rusty to begin with but theyve got three warm up games to get it right so hopefully well all be alright for the start of the series
5811621 long years ago we made a tryst with destiny and now the time comes when we

5811624 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5811625 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time
5811626 were not as concerned about it as we initially were
5811627 russia is hoping that pervez musharrafs resignation will not have any negative impact on political stability in this large asian country we are hoping that the situation in pakistan will stay within the framework of the constitution and law and order will be observed there
5811628 i would like these positive tendencies to grow stronger in our relations

5811655 younger children seem more interested in setting short term goals for their learning in the game compared to older children who are more interested in simply playing and the actions of playing
5811656 thus younger children may show a greater need for focusing on small aspects of a given problem than older children
5811657 they have to address the immediate issues like inflation and the long term structural problems of pakistani polity they cant use musharraf as an excuse any more
5811658 it is a change about the democratic spirit and transition and the establishment of constitutionality
5811659 it is now really a test of their ability and a test of their capacity to deliver
5811660 we had elected representatives chosen by the people on the other we had a controversial president who was patronizing the opposition
5811661 politics are inherently competitive but the ruling coalition partners are likely to stay together for a while
5811662 i give a call to the lawyers to lower the black flags over the bar associations
5811663 i am not a witch hunter but there are many charges
5811664 i dont think there will be any fundamental change in the relations between the united states and pakistan
5811665 the ruling coalition will more or less follow the policy of musharraf in relations with afghanistan india and in the countrys tribal areas however they would like to exercise some freedom to negotiate instead of using all out force
5811666 we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists
5811667 its not only a threat to the united states western europe and the whole free world but its a threat to pakistan as well
5811668 we are committed to fight against those extremists and terrorists who are destroying and making the world not safe
5811669 whats very troubling for the americans is most pakistanis think that the war on terror is not their war its our war
5811670 a step toward moving pakistan on to a more stable political footing

5811700 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
5811701 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
5811702 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
5811703 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll

5811753 i dont want to tell you what im thinking right now because its not positive i mean i feel so betrayed by my body once again and its just such a tough break for me
5811754 our approach allows investors to obtain the very same benefits as they would with a hedge fund without the limitations usually associated with hedge funds
5811755 we use a similar investment philosophy as you would with global tactical asset allocation
5811756 it is an investment strategy that attempts to exploit short term market inefficiencies by taking positions in various markets with a view to profiting from relative movements across those markets
5811757 our philosophy is simple we dont charge any management fees but participate with a 10 performance fee and a high water mark the transparency of a separate managed account and the elimination of all hedge fund imposed barriers make our approach much more attractive to the investor
5811758 mom tomorrow im going to tell you i love you again

5811781 the most important thing is the one quarterback you have on the field
5811782 i dont know if any other team has three like we do other teams might have one guy that is better statistically or with returning experience but we have three guys we feel pretty good about that doesnt mean anything if the one on the field isnt getting the job done
5811783 im a little disappointed knowing that i tied and got second not that i got second by three or five tenths
5811784 i had the same exact score so that makes a little harder to take unfortunately you cant control the judges and as soon as you land your dismount its up to them
5811785 i felt like i went out there and did one of the better routines i could do
5811786 my dad told me to go out there do the best routine and try and stick the dismount i knew my routine wasnt the best but i told him at least i stuck the dismount because i hadnt done that with that routine in any competition this year
5811787 the u s spends twice per capita what other major industrialized countries spend on health care and costs continue to rise faster than income

5811799 i have travelled the world competing and now i have the chance to share my love and passion for gymnastics with millions of fans all over the us
5811800 promoting the sport i love so much has always been one of the reasons i started as a young girl i hope my fans are as excited to see me on the tour as i am to see them
5811801 the conclusive truth in regards to the events prior to and directly after the popular consultation in 1999
5811802 the commission concluded that indonesia also bears state responsibility for those gross human rights violations such as murder rape torture illegal detention and forced mass deportations that were committed by militias with the support and or participation of indonesian institutions and their members
5811803 we are determined to bring a closure to a chapter of our recent past
5811804 those who committed crimes against humanity throughout indonesias invasion and occupation of timor leste must be identified and prosecuted for the sake of justice for past victims in timor leste and for a future in which human rights are respected in indonesia
5811805 put a priority on rehabilitating the names of accused perpetrators over justice or compensation for victims
5811806 the process of creating the ctf did not follow the constitution of timor leste because the agreement signed by the presidents of timor leste and indonesia was not ratified by the national parliament of timor leste in accordance with article 95 3f of the timor leste constitution
5811807 is contrary to the principles of international laws which were ratified by the state of timor leste and to article 160 of its constitution which says that there must be a justice process for crimes against humanity
5811808 ctf is only one mechanism of addressing or looking at what atrocities may have happened in the country there is also something called prosecution

5811810 since the biggest water gap is in northern el paso county we need to hear more
5811811 what are we doing about keeping colorado river water in our state
5811812 you look at that section of river and its choked with sediment
5811813 you take care of fountain and the other problems go away
5811814 the citys water treatment system is about to get an overhaul following the completion of a master water plan last fall the city council directed efforts to explore the revamping of several major areas of the water treatment and storage system at mondays council meeting the first steps to making the overhaul a reality were taken water resource manager doug montgomery presented three items to the council for approval concerning the project the master water plan compiled by the engineering company tec out of the front range listed multiple items as critical needs including the tank piping the water treatment plant and the valve house the treating and distribution system have been in place for over 40 years said montgomery
5811815 if we cant solve this groundwater problem were going to be out of water said pikes peak regional water authority manager gary barber he added the area is in need of a solution that will involve connecting with a river which is unfortunate given the fact monument is about as far away from a river as any other area in colorado
5811816 monument is going to have to decide who its allies are
5811817 my concern is that they arent recognizing how geographically compact the oil shale resource is there is this idea that theres 800 billion barrels of recoverable resource but about half of that is in the piceance basin
5811818 this is sort of frightening because you could really mess things up here you get the wrong people all of the sudden youre choking on the air quality in a class 1 pristine area
5811819 development of oil shale in colorado could significantly affect the councils ability to serve existing customers and the future growth projected for the front range of colorado
5811820 even though the benefits of oil shale are nationwide in terms of the impact on overall oil prices the environmental impacts of oil shale are almost 100 percent colorado
5811821 were substantially reducing anything that has to be disposed of
5811822 i always thought that wayne brady was an amazingly talented performer with an incredible voice
5811823 when asked by his producers if i would be interested in signing him as an artist to peak my response was an emphatic yes
5811824 a 20 year old lass with a guitar a strong will thick eyeliner and a voice that snaps you to attention we give her a year before shes headlining the orpheum theater
5811825 four floors and twenty seven years ago our father and mother brought forth in a courtroom a new arrangement called divorce
5811826 she only loves me when shes drunk when shes drunk im a bar room hunk
5811827 nothing against being signed to a major label but most of the time its about what they want you to do as opposed to what the artist wants to do i have nothing against jive but i really just wanted to be me seriously i got tired of being held back
5811828 of course there is a happiness that comes with independence but i also felt more confident in the studio
5811829 i was able to work at my own pace choose my collaborators and sing the truth kedar and i have been working together forever and we know how to make a great soul record
5811830 ive developed many close relationships with some of the best in the business
5811831 when it came time for me to go into the studio i was able to call on my friends like puffy bryan michael cox and video director billie woodruff to come through
5811832 i only like working with people who can take their art to the next level but believe me getting all the right folks for this project was a blessing
5811833 all of us know what its like to be feeling somebody who might not be feeling you
5811834 for a lot of guys its not about what they have but what they want
5811835 they passed along some tracks and i was really digging what these guys were doing i mixed the song myself in a home studio i have owned for about eight years i call it simply joes crib studio
5811836 i like doing things quickly and in the home studio i can get in the zone and work at my own pace
5811837 i recorded that song with trey songz and mario because you almost never hear r amp b guys singing together
5811838 i remember how hyped i was when quincy jones put out the secret garden and i wanted that kind of vibe on the record
5811839 though i dont play on this project im working on something special right now where im playing everything in the studio
5811840 the artists who are my heroes be it marvin prince or donny were never too proud to reveal there true selves it is impossible to be a true artists if your art isnt honest although it might hurt sometimes i have no problem baring the realness of my life in the songs
5811841 i spend a lot of time overseas and those sounds are as much a part of my influence as soul or gospel i want to experiment and mix a little of that flavor with what i do best
5811842 bryan and i have worked together a few times in the past and obviously his track record speaks for itself
5811843 i wanted the title to be direct simple and set the tone for the album in this past year i experienced the unraveling of my marriage and the birth of my first son it was during this year that i wrote the material for the new record and performed over 150 shows more than ever i think its important to be as open and honest as possible both as a songwriter and as a person one positive side to the tumultuous year ive had is this new found freedom to say it as it is to admit who i am and where ive been faults and all i feel this is a total crossroads for me
5811844 i am making this record for me and them and i wanted them to see their record being made
5811845 fitzpatrick and steckly left the door open and i took advantage after being so close last season it was great to get a win here in front of these awesome fans
5811846 its like a little league pitcher thats just a huge fan of the sport and they bring up mickey mantle to play ball with you frank has meant so much to the sport and having him back in the sport is only going to make it better
5811847 there really arent any words to describe it it has been a gift of a year of all the years this has been the most dominant weve ever been its just an awesome car
5811848 to have kurt johnson and dave connolly both go red against you isnt something you expect and well take it thats for sure
5811849 we got over the transmission problems that we had saturday and we really got it done today
5811850 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5811851 let me just say that first and foremost that that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys there at jgr
5811852 i want to apologize to nascar to our partners to toyota guys a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5811853 thats a first and that was a lot of fun
5811854 it took me awhile to get use to my car
5811855 after being in louis car it took me about five laps to get used to how fast my car was
5811856 when you start at the back and have to work through traffic like that the big thing you dont want is to tear it up but looks like we got through pretty good
5811857 that was really disappointing because we had a car that could have won
5811858 joe had to swerve for a slow car and i was full throttle coming out of the corner and i got him
5811859 i think kirk was happier that i won than i was
5811860 for several years cdw has been our it provider and they have enjoyed success in the past with hosting customers at racing events
5811861 we look forward to having them on board in chicago and appreciate the opportunity to show their customers the strong it backbone that kv racing technology has built with cdws help
5811862 it was good i was pretty happy i think i could have run a little quicker if we had got back out there got a pretty good car ran some race stuff early seems like the qualifying stuff is going to get us up in the top 10 i am pretty happy
5811863 just the race tracks we have been going to i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
5811864 yea i am looking forward to the last third of the season we seem to do really well at all them race tracks we seem to gain a lot of points or have the ability to gain a lot of points in those two stretches the first and last part of the season i figured the summer would be rough and it was i dont know why that is other than there arent any favorite race tracks of mine in that little stretch that is one thing i know for sure we tried the best we could to get through that stretch pretty good and do better i dont know i wasnt no happier about it than i have been in the past starting here we will start to see some improvement and start a run like we have been running at the start of the year like i think we are capable of doing
5811865 no we havent been running that good lately we are coming up on some tracks where we run pretty good i like the tracks and i like my chances
5811866 it would be nice you know it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
5811867 yes but i mean it depends on what side of the fence you are on man if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how if you are the guy who had the fastest car all day you arent real happy about it i have been on both sides of it it goes down in the history books however it goes do in there you know everybody would like to just go out there and just out run the hell out of everybody to win races sometimes you have to take them how you get them
5811868 i think we are facing different stuff i have just never ran good at the tracks that are in the middle of the season it is funny that they are all together but maybe that is kind of good jeff has just kind of struggled with the car a little bit here and there all year you know i think by the time we are in the chase they seem to have it turned around hopefully we will have that too
5811869 i can say this i dont think the pit stop strategy ruined the race any more than how bad our car was handling or running at that particular part of the race
5811870 he is just a good ole guy you know i wish it was different for him but oh well he is pretty tough and i feel like when it comes down to it he will prove to everybody yea we are human we make mistakes but he is damn sure the guy for the job in my opinion
5811871 he is in one of them sure right now i dont know if it will be like that for a long long time but he has a lot of people to answer to just like i do and just like the rest of the team the team itself when they dont do right or have a problem or whatever you know they have to deal with it that is part of being in this sport man you know you have to live up to all expectations and you have to meet some expectations you get paid a lot of money to do there is a lot of good things about it too he had a bad he said he didnt read any of the papers or listen to anybody and so i said that was all right its good we will move on when i am in the race car out on the race track i cant do the math and try to figure out what the strategy is that he has planned and we dont talk about that before the race sometimes the best laid plans never work out i dont know what his strategy i didnt have a problem with what it was it was definitely the wrong call to make in hindsight but again even if we make the right call and stay on the same strategy with those other guys we got a 25 th or 30 th place car at best because he had some issues with the suspension i like the way the man does his job and i am glad he is helping me i have his back and hes got mine regardless if he makes that mistake again this week we will try to learn from it and move on
5811872 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard it is just a lot of work it is a pain in the butt really it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
5811873 sports fans have identified a strong need and desire for this complementary service tsn2 provides additional value to our progressive and passionate sports audience as it allows us to air two live events simultaneously giving sports fans more choice and diversity
5811874 by taking the tsn alternate feed to a full time service in tsn2 we are better positioned to serve sports fans by being able to consistently provide live coverage of two events taking place concurrently tsn2 is a must have for sports fans
5811875 pretty good we had one problem with the ignition box and that got us a little bit behind for one run i feel like were a little bit better i think we ended up tenth that was pretty good so far
5811876 you got to love them for that but at the same time its a competitive sport
5811877 we were an awesome race team last year had one of the best years that ive ever had and steve was the guy that was guiding that ship so i believe one hundred percent in him your confidence gets down and a lot of things happen performances arent always there and its the toughest thing to rebound from that and thats kind of the situation were in right now were working really hard we tested this week in kentucky and we just continue to work hard at it
5811878 all those things contributed to the type of day we had not to mention robby gordon spinning me out on the last lap my favorite part about it was mark martin sending me a text he said hey man we had a tough day but its tough days that make you appreciate the good ones a lot more you know hes so right and i appreciated that very much thats the way we think and focus
5811879 again even though weve been hit or miss this year i feel like those last ten races are all good tracks for us other than texas texas is a track that has been our achilles heel and were going to work hard to try to fix that when youre looking at a deficit of eighty or ninety points going into it from the way kyle busch has been running this year thats a lot to overcome we know we need some bonus points before we start that chase and all our focus is on is racing hard and trying to get those wins and get the best finishes that we can
5811880 no were not in a position to take a gamble right now were in a tricky position right now because we have one or two bad finishes where we could find ourselves very easily slipping back and not be secure going into richmond we want to be secure going into richmond and so these next couple of weeks if we put good finishes together then we might be in a position to take some more risks i say risks its experimenting with things that youre testing its taking gambles on pit strategy calls those types of things
5811881 i pay attention to it i try not to get too caught up in it because it doesnt change how we approach things every weekend unless you have a big points lead or if youre on the outside of the top twelve if youre on the outside of the top twelve youre going for broke right now youre taking gambles when youre up front you got nothing to lose we were in that position last year right now were pretty much just kind of doing what we normally do which is go out there race hard clean and put the best average finish we can together
5811882 i dont want to see a second date anywhere i think we need to go everywhere once in my opinion i dont know kansas has been good to me so its not like they dont deserve it or we wouldnt like going there thats up to them
5811883 i think that its being able to get to the front
5811884 if you have a car thats working good you could take a few more gambles to maintain the track position if your car is not good enough then youve got to work on it and put four tires on it thats what we need this week is a good enough car to be able to stay out or take two tires and do some of those things that are paying off for those other guys
5811885 when have we ever complained about horsepower horsepower is not an issue with us not at all power is good
5811886 jim comes to a few races a year or several races a year im not really sure on that one hes a part of our research and development team so im guessing its important that they come and pay attention to what happens at the race track as well sometimes you get caught up in your world of testing all the time youve got to see what guys are doing here at the track so im guessing hes just kind of eyes and ears for hendrick motorsports
5811887 i tell you last week impressed the heck out of me what he did in sonoma didnt impress me as much because they hit the caution just right he had the track position last week he beat one of the best there is out there in tony stewart he was solid all day long that shows me what kind of team they have and what kind of driver kyle is they got their momentum back i was saying prior to the race weekend and i wasnt trying to stir anything up i was just pointing out the way that things were going that i felt like they had lost some momentum but they got it all back in a hurry last weekend
5811888 theyve been consistent all year long and they continue to be consistent i would really like to see them as high up in the points as theyve been at times id like to see them going out there and doing what im talking about leading more laps and being a little bit more dominant so i dont really feel like theyve lost anything
5811889 the car stumbled coming through the bus stop or whatever they call that on the back straightaway and we were lucky just to make it even after we left pit road it was stumbling like it was low on fuel that cost us so much time last week it was a terrible day dont get me wrong but had that not happened it was going to be a terrible day where we finished fifteenth not twenty ninth
5811890 the last they had heard from me i was talking a little bit about where it had been loose but it had gotten tight big time on me toward the end of that run the last comment i was making was about being tight and they were actually making me tighter thats why we came in and made those major adjustments on that one pit stop it was just one of those days when i got hit on the last lap by robby gordon i didnt even say anything because i was just like this is just one of those days that nothing really goes your way
5811891 yeah anytime you go to a one groove race track especially on a short track youre going to have kind of a little bit of russian roulette but now weve got multiple grooves there to me i love it i think the racing is three times better its just the crashes dont happen as much so if you love crashes youre still going to see them at bristol but youre not going to see them as often or as much as you used to because basically when the guys got frustrated with the car in front of them they just took them out and thats not racing in my opinion thats more bumper cars now were going to bristol and were racing and i love it we havent been as good there since they re did the track so im anxious to get there and be better but i do like what theyve done
5811892 a little bit the tempers are only because a guy cheap shots you you know thats more where tempers come from the tempers just dont come from driving around bristol
5811893 we definitely have it on our minds we like to represent them the best we can every weekend but when youre here i think there is a little bit more pride on the line because you know there is more pride on the line for them being near detroit
5811894 theyve been winning plenty this year so i dont think it would be any big surprise to any of us
5811895 its going to be interesting i think that what i look and see now is you take tony stewart and you make him a car owner and look what kind of talent he starts attracting from drivers to personnel to crew chiefs and car chiefs its just amazing how somebody like tony stewart can motivate and change the whole attitude of a garage area to making that into a team worth working for and attracting top people i think thats how you get results thats how you build a top quality team so the fact that we have a partnership with them were only looking at is as a positive
5811896 im sure hes going to be a lot more involved his name is on the marquee it comes first my name is way down the list hes going to take on a lot more responsibility than i am mine is more for the future i think that tony likes to be involved thats the biggest challenge as a driver and an owner of not letting those headaches outweigh the focus on driving the race car there is nobody out here that i think could do a better job than what tony can hell do fine its the obvious distractions and issues that can come from trying to operate that business and drive at the same time
5811897 yeah as i get older it gets a little bit more difficult every race every year is crucial and important and you want to do well and you feel like youve got the team capable of doing well and its always frustrating its just how you show it i feel like if i go stomping my feet and throwing things around here it doesnt make me run good it doesnt make it any better so going back to the fans talking and calling in and stuff the reason why i dont really respond to that is because we respond to it internally we deal with it internally like any good business should when you start getting into trying to explain to outsiders it doesnt make it any better i only hope that our fans support me and steve and the whole team and i know that they are they just want us to do good the funniest thing happened to me in 2000 i had a fan come up to me and said you need to tell robbie loomis he needs to get that thing going and i said hey trust me weve got as much on the line as anybody and he goes im losing a lot of money on all my bets every weekend because i pick you every weekend and thats when it hit me how far the fans take it and why they take it so avidly for many different reasons it could be that type of situation or it could be just that theyve been a longtime fan and their pride is on the line but i still promise you we all have a lot more on the line than anybody else
5811898 hes been great ive had a great time working with him hes funny and he knows a lot about the cars ive been able to learn first hand what a great driver he is
5811899 yeah yeah it was that times ten shes been teething this week so not only does she not care how i ran but its very quick how you dont even think about what happened at watkins glen because all you care about is her trying to get her naps in and eating and having a temperature and all the things that come along with teething not to mention i was testing in kentucky and had a full production day for pepsi so between all those things i havent thought a whole lot about watkins glen this week
5811900 no i meant i dont stomp around and throw things out here laughter i do plenty of that dont worry we handle things the way that i feel like is productive and you dont just turn the other cheek you dont deny whats going on you face it head on everybody handles it professionally and you can only have the type of relationship like steve and i have where we dont take things personally he can criticize me and i can criticize him and we only want to get better and know that hes the leader of this team and im the best tool that he can possibly have to help make the car better and i have a responsibility he has a responsibility and thats where our focus is
5811901 no were very fortunate in that sense were not having a terrible year you know its frustrating because i know were capable of running better and we should be but we still are sixth in the points weve been outside of the chase before so weve had worse years so its nothing that we need to start quitting our jobs and moving to other teams and all of that type of things its nothing like that and were fortunate that when we do have tough seasons that our guys dont leave were still able to continue to get quality people at our organization and thats what gets us through the tough times
5811902 no i am and im not i always knew how talented he was but keeping his head on straight and not making mistakes and being able to handle the pressures and all those things are what were unanswered questions and this year so far hes handling himself extremely well under the pressure im surprised not as much by him but im more surprised at how good that team is i think it shows just how good they really are by how well hes done he did well with us but now with that team theyve both gone to a whole other level

5811904 this one is special we worked hard to tie the record i was pretty close to tying it last year this year the team worked really hard to give a good car to me and andy im happy to be on the podium and win
5811905 its special for many reasons this is my first ever victory at trois rivieres many obviously for him its a special occasion for him and for kinetic this is their first victory in the series i owe a big congratulations and thanks to everybody at kinetic and marc antoine camirand for doing such a great job with the car this weekend earning pole position and pulling away from the guys he gave me the car in the lead and i didnt have to pass a single person i just had to maintain but it was tough because our competition here in the fords were on my tail chasing me the whole weekend they were very very strong every time i made a mistake they got right to me both cars did a really good job i have to say thank you to our guys who have been hustling on this car and doing a ton of work behind the scenes and this is a big day for kinetic
5811906 im obviously extremely pleased with the way the weekend went jbs motorsports and bret seafuse they all did an outstanding job they gave me a great car we had a great pit strategy i got in the car and had to like everybody out there conserve the brakes and take it easy it was definitely a handful here racing in the streets like bret said we were looking at the big picture championship points first and second those guys had bad days today so we made up a lot of points i couldnt be happier
5811907 that last caution isnt exactly what we wanted james has built a little bit of a cushion on billy a couple of car lengths but it panned out and we couldnt be happier
5811908 i just like to thank ray mason he did an awesome job this weekend he qualified really well in this blue ford we had great pit strategy and great racing he did a really good job with the pit stop and got us out on the track and gained a few positions i sat in third place behind james gue for quite some time i was just pressuring him trying to make him make a mistake but he was all over it all race long i was just trying to hang on to third
5811909 bob osborne crew chief and all the guys in the pit crew did a great job and the greatest part of todays win was that we didnt give up any more bonus points to kyle
5811910 weve got to try to go out and win the next three events and enter the chase on even ground
5811911 kyle is really good on the restarts and i didnt want to have to go through that pain today
5811912 pretty much nothing he was just able to take off on those restarts and get a pretty good run through one and two and once he got that gap it was just over well take it at least we know we can keep up with the 99 edwards
5811913 i thought it was a very optimistic move by lacroix and frustrating as he was clearly quicker than me he should have seen i was struggling with the rear and therefore he must have known hed have been able to get by cleanly probably through the next two turns
5811914 it was a bummer of a weekend but we really didnt help ourselves we put ourselves in danger of having something like this happen by qualifying as badly as we did as a team we simply need to improve when we get to the next race to make sure we can avoid incidents like this and really put up a strong fight over the final three rounds
5811915 fine if you wont let me do that then ill call you a lardbutt for the rest of the day
5811916 well how would you like it if i called you a lardbutt it would probably hurt your feelings
5811917 who wants to walk next to me while i rollerblade around the park

5811926 suddenly the major he came to get me in my house
5811927 he just said to me were going to dili the president called us to talk
5811928 when we left luala we drove really slow because the meeting was at 6am the idea was for us to go there meet at 6am talk talk talk then go back to ermera
5811929 when we got out of the vehicle guard kelimut started to arm his weapon
5811930 i started to think whats going on we came to meet the president and the security is acting in this manner so the major said calm down calm down major said wheres the president
5811931 no i didnt even go slightly in my weapon it was pointed down we didnt go for a shootout if we went there for a shootout obviously i wouldnt come
5811932 it didnt even get to five minutes i can tell you it was really fast
5811933 we retreated i only shot up as warning shots because if we just waited there the australian forces and the tanks wouldve closed all the ways we didnt go there to shoot i had to shoot up to warn the boys to get out they were shooting at us
5811934 it was the major we came because of him and then he died
5811935 live nation benefits from the difficulty of replicating the live experience that casual and passionate fans pay for in good times or bad
5811936 started with control of the venues then used that to spread out into other areas of the music industry and by so doing its competing with the record labels
5811937 if live nation can get to the point where its paying on parity to what the labels are paying or even below that then it will be a great strategy

5811959 information has come to light that you may be inadmissible to the united states
5811960 we really have to scrub it and are now going to take a good look to see if it holds
5811961 we do not understand why and we do not understand what changed
5811962 i only got two clean laps early in the session before other cars started playing a factor
5811963 i am disappointed for my team and sponsors today but when a new part breaks there is not much you can do about it
5811964 we were on track for a top five finish today now we look forward to the final four oval events and hope to take our no 39 dickies dodge to victory lane before the end of the year
5811965 we completely changed our set up for todays race and i changed my driving style a bit and it seemed to work well
5811966 we used the race as a bit of a test session but i was also careful to keep my nose clean i was definitely catching the ninth place car at the end and if wed had a couple of more laps i might have had a shot at him
5811967 it was a great team effort in the end of the day and theres no doubt if wed started the weekend off with what we had today then wed have been a lot faster but its all part of the learning experience for me its been a great experience competing at trois rivieres and i had a lot of fun racing today
5811968 i want to prove they have made a big mistake i dont think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here
5811969 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds i am waiting

5811979 our proposal succeeded despite strong opposition by de facto prime minister xanana gusmao and finance minister emilia pires to the very end
5811980 it seemed to us unjust and unnecessary for the government to continue to deny these impoverished veterans their pensions when they have been quite prepared to make a priority of special payments to deserters from the defence force these veterans in contrast sacrificed themselves and their families so that we can have the freedom and sovereign nation we have today
5811981 it was a source of frustration for us who have tried to promote the cause of the veterans that there was this constant proposition coming from the then president now de facto prime minister that the database was not ready yet in late 2006 and in the first half of 2007 before the parliamentary elections it was good enough to use the database to award around 17 000 medals of honor to veterans and their survivors this issue was politicized by political figures in the campaign including mr gusmao and fretilin was painted as neglectful and mean for not paying the veterans
5811982 but when it comes to an outrageously high spending budget on largesse such as luxury cars for mps overseas travel for ministers and others in government rehabilitation of homes for ministers and others they forget about the veterans and keep saying the database needs to be fixed we dont accept that anymore and are happy that the majority of the parliament agreed with us now it is a matter for the government to cut out the fat it has for travel entertainment and other luxuries to make sure the veterans are paid
5811983 we do not want any more excuses from mr gusmao and mr virgilio simith the secretary of state who is the chair of the veterans commissions
5811984 we insist on this but most of all its the veterans including mps who are veterans and supported our proposal for amendment who spoke out in these terms its time to act the government must act or be held further responsible for the neglect of the veterans for which mr gusmao and his appointees must carry their share of the responsibility
5811985 we need an international investigation in order to overcome all of these questions of impartiality of all those involved in an investigation
5811986 i think people are looking forward to justice and a credible process to take its course and i think that for allegations as startling as this to come out is a concern to us all
5811987 the parliament has provided an indicator to the government that it should be an international investigation
5811988 as long as political leaders figures maintain level heads and insist on a transparent and independent investigation i think that could minimise any political tensions
5811989 i am so sad i will never stop thinking of him
5811990 its the same for his friends and family even after six months these feelings remain so strongly
5811991 if he wanted to kill horta he could have done that on february in maliana when they had a meeting why he not kill him there
5811992 he is trained military it is easy for him to kill if he went there to kill people all of hortas guards would be dead
5811993 the man in charge the prosecutor general has already in our eyes proved himself to be anything but politically impartial
5811994 they could also have deleted some numbers some messages we dont know

5812000 he will not get a more fierce fight from a united states senator than he will have from me
5812001 on this issue he couldnt be more wrong nothing is more crucial for colorado than water and i oppose any suggestion that the federal government should get involved in how we share it with arizona california or any other state
5812002 were not talking about short term here his comments are based on his fundamental understanding of the challenges faced by western states
5812003 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
5812004 at a minimum it would pit these basin states against one another in extended negotiations instead of facilitating cooperative efforts to address the significant water supply challenges facing the arid west thats not the kind of leadership we need
5812005 i believe our board would be strongly opposed to reopening the compact
5812006 we believe that this was something that was negotiated and weve relied on for our water supply planning

5812009 he sent a personal message asking her to get on board he has always admired her music and thinks she is the perfect choice because of her unique appeal to black and white voters
5812010 she believes he is going to be the first black american president and she is honoured to be a part of that
5812011 the ballistic textbooks are very clear on this burning and blackening is a feature of very close range shots probably from less than a foot away if you see burning and soot type burning it indicates that the barrel of the gun was very close to the skins surface

5812020 mohamed and darnell you are not even doing it right
5812021 youre not even standing up if were working as a team let us give you some feedback
5812022 youre sitting there going one two what are we in the army what the f k
5812023 we need to be able to do it in time and you havent got it mo more than anyone
5812024 ive f ing got it dont tell me i havent got it
5812025 mo youre not doing it everyone else is apart from you because youve got some kind of stick stuck up your a e which you need to remove if you want to pass this task
5812026 shut the f k up dont tell me ive got a stick stuck up my a e
5812027 i wouldnt have liked to have taught this without you here
5812028 no were not going to pass if its got to be perfect im the only one thats going to be
5812029 what are the others doing watching the instruction dvd again
5812030 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties
5812031 i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
5812032 senator mccains position on opening up the colorado river compact is absolutely wrong and would only happen over my dead body
5812033 its an anathema to the fundamental principles of colorados water rights and our compacts
5812034 we did not want california to gobble up all of the water supply on the colorado river and they would have done that under the doctrine of equitable apportionment
5812035 in my view the compact is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nail to make sure that it is not opened up
5812036 just last year the seven states entered into a new implementing agreement and that agreement is working as intended
5812037 it would be sheer folly to re open the compact at a time like this when all of the states are working cooperatively on this issue
5812038 i urge reclamation to heed these warnings and slow down work on the final eis so that public comments and concerns can be seriously considered and to provide time to find more collaborative less contentious and potentially less litigious resolution
5812039 weve got a list this shouldnt take us more than half an hour forty five minutes tops
5812040 we read the newspaper together which was her way of showing me how smart she was naomi was eleven years old and she took pride in being able to shake her head at the world she was convinced that american foreign policy in the middle east was a failure that a two state solution in israel was inevitable and that enough wasnt being done about the global aids crisis she tucked and folded the creases in the washington post with an agility fitting an old man and even the way she leaned against the counter her head resting on her chin as she thumbed her way through the articles spoke of a wisdom that seemed to belong more to her mother than to her
5812041 i think that when you go into the diary room and they ask you what are you going to bring as head of house judging on what you say they help you do it
5812042 so i said you know i want to bring fun party entertainment to the house and i think im the best person to do it and obviously what they do is listen almost like its a request if you see what i mean
5812043 ill give you another example mikey obviously went in there and said theres going to be no sleeping in my week everyones going to be going to bed on time blah blah blah
5812044 big brother has heard that and given us f k all to do in the week just putting an alarm in the rooms and looking for people who are sleeping in the day
5812045 that was the best alarm ever imagine if we do this as our task

5812055 the president of the republic left veryclear instructions to his office to send the rectifying budget forpublication only if the decision of the court of appeal declared thatthe law was in conformity with all the requirements of theconstitution
5812056 the presidents own words televised to the nation onthe 5th of august 2008 and confirmed by the presidents officecommuniqu on the 6th of august the following day were that he leftclear instructions that the rectifying budget was not to be sent forpublication with the official gazette
5812057 it was clear that this is what he had in mind when he spoke to thepeople
5812058 however we do not have confidence in others who work in the officeof the president of the republic we have grave reservations abouttheir loyalty to the president and their political impartiality to beworking in such a high office
5812059 we are very lucky that these suspect actions are such that may befixed with the good will and cooperation of other institutions of ourstate but we have to ask what if it involved something moreserious something that could not be so easily reversed or rectified such as a declaration of stage of siege or a declaration to dissolveparliament then what the president had done all he could to ensurehis intent was clear and that his actions would not impact negativelyupon the nation but even this could not safeguard a serious errorfrom occurring
5812060 we cannot simply leave this matter as it is it is important for usthat state institutions know the truth of what actually happened wehave to know clearly whether this was the result of human error orwhether there was some more deliberate act or omission to pervert theexpressed will and intent of the president to usurp his duties andpowers an in depth investigation must occur into this matter andfretilin give its full support to the president in initiating anappropriate legal investigation
5812061 this was not just a matter of anadministrative issue in the presidents office but a matter of greatimportance to the government the parliament political parties andthe people who need to have confidence that the highest office in theland is functioning legally and constitutionally not to mention with administrative efficiency whoever the president is or will be
5812062 the worst indication is that the sefep office used a budget worth 100 240 allocated for the districts of baucau viqueque and lautem whereby the moneys intended to be used to acquire equipment to be used in the 2 work per day project but the moneys were in fact used for some other unknown purpose because it is all fiction
5812063 a case of maladministration is one involving 35 780 00 of cooperation funds between the ministry of social solidarity and portugal given to the ministry of solidarity to acquire transport but it is said that these funds were not used to buy a vehicle but instead was used to rent vehicles
5812064 there are many corrupt people emerging now in tl because the responsible institutions never undertake in dept investigations to show the public whether there is a lot of corruption in tl
5812065 labehs report has no basis and has no strong evidence that i can see from the accusations to bring me down but the government thanks labehs initiative to control and battle government corruption
5812066 for us these accusations serve to give more credence to the private sectors participation in combating corruption so as to promote public transparency and accountability and we will rectify our work to become better
5812067 in the first instance the accusations said we used the funds totaling 100 240 00 allocated to acquire equipment for the 2 a day project in baucau viqueque and lospalos districts was not that we did not have it but the transitional budget approval process was late and the procurement process was late too and the implementation of the 2 a day project had finished because of this that the communities did not receive the equipment but the equipment for them is being delivered this week because the revised budget has been approved
5812068 to say that we hired a vehicle is also wrong because this money that came from the portuguese cooperation was to support the sefpe to use to buy a vehicle because the vehicle had already been purchased and we had not hired it
5812069 dr christopher said we used the money 37 780 00 for acquiring a vehicle instead to hire a vehicle is also wrong because the money that was given by portuguese cooperation to support the sefpe to use for vehicles this vehicle we already had we did not hire it
5812070 i want to speak about the information that many of my family work for me and that many of my family travel overseas all this is incorrect because my family does not make up all the 2000 people but during recruitment i selected my chief of staff from baucau my driver from bobonaro and my secretary from same and some from same because if there is there is maybe only one member of my family as people will be able to see for themselves
5812071 the provedor has not yet received information but we will yet undertake an in depth investigation regarding the information and allegations pointed to by labeh in order to find any relevant facts and in depth evidence in order to be able to recommend anything to the prosecutor according to law
5812072 the provedor cannot speak about all corruption in tl because we lack investigators and also finances we also ask but the government has not increased funding for the lack of transport and equipment but we continue to do the work despite the pdhj lacking in many things which the government has failed to attend to
5812073 labeh has spoken a lot about us not doing our work but they do not understand the difficulties we confront because by rights they should be requesting the government to increase our funding so that we can capacitate our people to train and increase the number of corruption investigators
5812074 the contracting company was informed by the vietnamese supplier that it could no longer supply rice at the price of us 510 as previously agreed

5812091 to argue that god is trying his best to save all mankind but that the majority of men will not let him save them is to insist that the will of the creator is impotent and that the will of the creature is omnipotent to throw the blame as many do upon the devil does not remove the difficulty for if satan is defeating the purpose of god then satan is almighty and god is no longer the supreme being

5812199 how do people run and not have all the stuff bounce out of their pockets
5812200 there are a lot of things going through my head right now
5812201 well i just dont think it is fair to me that my husband knows about you and me and that your woman in mexico luc a does not know about you and me i dont think it is fair to me nor to her
5812202 you need to tell her ese tipo en honduras already knows about you and me i told him the second month we were together he knows that i dont want to be with him he knows that i want to be with you but luc a knows nada about us she still thinks that you want to be with her and that you are only with her
5812203 but i already told you that i am going to tell her when i go to mexico i need to do it in person
5812204 but why i told my husband about you over the phone it is going to take you a lot of money to save up to go back to mexico you know it is you wont be going back for a year or so
5812205 yes and when you go of course i will wait for you but you need to tell luc a about us and not wait a year or more to do it you need to tell her now
5812206 maybe what you are really saying is that you dont want to continue our relationship you dont want to be with me anymore
5812207 i never said that i do want to continue this relationship with you and i do still want to be with you but you need to tell her she still thinks that you are with her and only her but really you are with me and her you have two girlfriends
5812208 yeah and i think it is better if you tell her now than tell her much later on like a year or so or more and make her think that you are with her and only her its not fair to me and its not fair to her
5812209 its all my fault that i fell in love with you
5812210 for example what if my husband didnt know about you and me what if i was talking to him almost every day and he still thought we were together i dont think you would like that very much would you
5812211 and what if for an example i get pregnant that is just another thing to worry about
5812212 or maybe you arent going to tell her because you arent sure yet if you really want to be with me or not
5812213 i already told you i want to be with you and stay with you i already told you that she doesnt love me
5812214 welllll then if she doesnt love you like you say she doesnt well then it should be no problem telling her that you want to be with me
5812215 but with this kind of thing i need to tell her face to face

5812552 youd see micro spacecraft mainly in communications instead of companies sharing a large satellite you could have even small companies getting their own micro spacecraft
5812553 for the military undetectability is also important either for surveillance applications or when it comes to zapping other satellites
5812554 and when it comes to a spacecraft less than 5 kilograms 10 pounds you cant really detect it unless its within a quarter of a mile of you larger spacecraft can be detected from farther and consequently blasted out of the sky
5812555 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5812556 thermal control was really the big barrier to developing miniature spacecraft
5812557 this should allow much more rapid development of micro and nano spacecraft
5812558 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it

5812736 on p 127 of the blind watchmaker dawkins writes dna gets the best of both worlds dna molecules themselves as physical entities are like dewdrops under the right conditions they come into existence at a great rate but no one of them has existed for long and all will be destroyed within a few months they are not durable like rocks but the patterns that they bear in their sequences are as durable as the hardest rocks they have what it takes to exist for millions of years and that is why they are still here today the essential difference from dewdrops is that new dewdrops are not begotten by old dewdrops dewdrops doubtless resemble other dewdrops but they dont specifically resemble their own parent dewdrops unlike dna molecules they dont form lineages and therefore cant pass on messages dewdrops come into existence by spontaneous generation dna messages by replication that is while dna molecules are material genes dna patterns are not though each concrete instance needs to exist in a material form genes therefore violate premise 2 of segers syllogism two dna molecules are particular entities but dna patterns are not therefore dawkins is not a materialist at least not according to segers definition
5812737 memes dawkins said on pbs 6 the minds big bang the only kind of evolutionary change were likely to see very much of is not genetic information at all its cultural evolution and if we put a darwinian spin on that then were going to be talking about the differential survival of memes as opposed to genes pbs 6 dawkins proposed the meme idea long ago in his book the selfish gene and psychologist sue blackmore of the university of west of england has been one of his recent champions she said on pbs 6 memes are ideas habits skills gestures stories songs anything which we pass from person to person by imitation we copy them just as the competition between genes shapes all of biological evolution so its the competition between memes that shapes our minds and cultures nowadays i would say that memetic evolution is going faster and faster and it has almost entirely taken over from biological evolution the more educated you are the less children you have that is memes fighting against genes pbs 6 now memes have apparently found a new home the internet and it has actually enslaved us we are told blackmore even believes that the idea of the self is an illusion produced by competing memes in the brain but under her own system we must ask her who is or rather what are actually proposing this idea but it becomes ridiculous when things such as the internet birth control any invention insulin are called memes a term that describes everything really describes nothing all that shes done is apply the same label to just about anything but this adds nothing to our knowledge its no wonder that the evolutionist jerry coyne called blackmores book a work not of science but of extreme advocacy he says that memes are but a flashy new wrapping around a parcel of old and conventional ideas coyne also believes that evolutionary psychology is non science and nonsense coyne is no creationist sympathizer but an ardent but ineffective opponent of creation 9 the discovery institute critique of the pbs series points out that if the likes of eugenie scott were truly concerned about non science being taught in the science classroom she would oppose evolutionary psychology and memetic evolution as well and certainly not support the use of this pbs series in science classrooms 10 no what shes opposed to are challenges to her materialistic faith

5812744 er now what do we do with this web site
5812745 our import sampling is typically focused on areas where we know weve got problems or weve seen problems in the past which is why were now increasing our sampling for peppers
5812746 if the fact that they were showing up on problem lists for a year doesnt make them high risk i dont know what does
5812747 if its across the board then thats a systemic problem that fda needs to be able to nimbly respond to
5812748 somebody could have picked up a box and looked at peppers if they wanted to but im not sure that would have been a high priority
5812749 it would require a big leap to think that salmonella in dried peppers could be related to problems in fresh chilies
5812750 if so many of the peppers we eat in the u s come in from mexico youd think we would want to pay more attention

5812763 you got diagnosed and six months later you were dead
5812764 the bad thing is that there is this perception that its a chronic manageable illness and its not so bad if you get it
5812765 a lot of research studies are coming out that seem to suggest some possible link or associations

5812783 the worst thing he could do to me would be to kill the children and not me
5812784 also the women who are having children are having fewer children

5812787 the black population is staying about the same and the white and asian populations are declining theyre not replacing themselves so the population is growing more diverse

5812812 there is certainly a need to improve access to mainstream sexual health services for aboriginal people
5812813 continuing access to effective sexual health service delivery is an essential part of reducing sexually transmissible infections among aboriginal people

5812821 why did charles darwin not cite blyths papers that dealt directly with natural selection
5812822 an attempt to classify the varieties of animals with observations on the marked seasonal and other changes which naturally take place in various british species and which do not constitute varieties
5812823 very commonly misapplied to individuals of a species which are merely undergoing a regular natural change either progressing from youth to maturity or gradually shifting according to fixed laws their colours with the seasons
5812824 a departure from the acknowledged type of a species either in structure in size or in colour
5812825 vague in the degree of being alike used to denote the slightest individual variation and the most dissimilar breeds which have originated from one common stock
5812826 the first class which i propose to style simple or slight individual variations differs only in degree from the last or true varieties and consists of mere differences of colour or of stature unaccompanied by any remarkable structural deviation also of slight individual peculiarities of any kind which are more or less observable in all animals whether wild or tame and which having a tendency to perpetuate themselves by generation may under particular circumstances become the origin of true breeds which constitute my third class of varieties but which in a state of nature are generally lost in the course of two or three generations
5812827 the second class of varieties which i would designate thus comprises the various changes which in a single individual or in the course of generations are gradually brought about by the operation of known causes such as the greater or less supply of nutriment the influence of particular sorts of food or either of these combined with the various privations consequent upon confinement which changes would as gradually and certainly disappear if these causes were removed
5812828 it is a general law of nature for all creatures to propagate the like of themselves and this extends even to the most trivial minutiae to the slightest individual peculiarities and thus among ourselves we see a family likeness transmitted from generation to generation when two animals are matched together each remarkable for a certain given peculiarity no matter how trivial there is also a decided tendency in nature for that peculiarity to increase and if the produce of these animals be set apart and only those in which the same peculiarity is most apparent be selected to breed from the next generation will possess it in a still more remarkable degree and so on till at length the variety i designate a breed is formed which may be very unlike the original type
5812829 many of the varieties of cattle and in all probability the greater number of those of domestic pigeons
5812830 the sexual passions excite to rivalry and conflict and the stronger must always prevail over the weaker the latter in a state of nature is allowed but few opportunities of continuing its race
5812831 in a large herd of cattle the strongest bull drives from him all the younger and weaker individuals of his own sex and remains sole master of the herd so that all the young which are produced must have had their origin from one which possessed the maximum of power and physical strength and which consequently in the struggle for existence was the best able to maintain his ground and defend himself from every enemy
5812832 in like manner among animals which procure their food by means of their agility strength or delicacy of sense the one best organized must always obtain the greatest quantity and must therefore become physically the strongest and be thus enabled by routing its opponents to transmit its superior qualities to a greater number of offspring
5812833 the same law therefore which was intended by providence to keep up the typical qualities of a species can be easily converted by man into a means of raising different varieties but it is also clear that if man did not keep up these breeds by regulating the sexual intercourse they would all naturally soon revert to the original type
5812834 which causes each race to be chiefly propagated by the most typical and perfect individuals
5812835 the last of these divisions to which i more peculiarly restrict the term variety consists of what are in fact a kind of deformities or monstrous births the peculiarities of which from reasons already mentioned would very rarely if ever be perpetuated in a state of nature but which by mans agency often become the origin of a new race
5812836 the breed of sheep now common in north america and known by the name of
5812837 t he deviations of this kind do not appear to have any tendency to revert to the original form
5812838 most probably could only be restored in a direct manner by the way in which the variety was first produced
5812839 t o this class may be also referred with more than probability some of the more remarkable varieties of the human species
5812840 periodical and other changes of appearance which naturally take place in various british animals and which do not constitute varieties
5812841 nature provides for the preyer as well as for the prey
5812842 disrupt the balance and therefore are usually weeded out quickly
5812843 usually are weeded out the species as they are must be perfectly adapted since otherwise the tints and markings would not have prevailed which in turn means that they are not mere decorations
5812844 the number direction and shape of the bones that compose each part of an animals body are always in a necessary relation to all the other parts in such a way that up to a point one can infer the whole from any one of them and vice versa

5812861 the number of times that a physician will deal with a surrogate decision maker is growing as our population ages and conditions such as alzheimers disease become more common the issue of how physicians interact with surrogates is a very important one we found that physicians often want to take an active role in determining what is right for a patient and often grapple with the needs of the patient versus those of the surrogate
5812862 i always think its important that its not a decision that the family member or the surrogate is making for themselves but it is a decision that they are making for someone else based upon their best knowledge of what that person would want
5812863 when i feel strongly that the patients quality of life is really poor then i do feel that it is appropriate for the physician to try and guide the family member toward a decision
5812864 if the patient cant make the decision then i discuss it with the family i sometimes will push the family to do what i think is best for the patient

5812870 the command for exterminating them with which 1 samuel 15 opens 1 sam 15 2 3 may have been given as a consequence of their raids having become more sanguinary under their then king agag 1 sam 15 33 it was clear to samuel that the struggle with these ancient and ever hostile opponents was a matter of life and death to israel according to the talmud the torah commands israel to do three things after completing the conquest of the holy land to appoint a king to eradicate amalek and to build the temple hence samuel introduced this command to battle amalek by telling saul that since he had been anointed as king amalek the leading force of evil in the world was to be wiped out entirely

5812902 brings catlin closer to its main cedants and producers since north america accounts for about 45 percent of catlins consolidated gross premiums written
5812903 the group has invested significantly in assembling a large and very experienced senior management and underwriting team to enhance its distribution and underwriting capabilities in both the admitted and non admitted insurance markets

5813110 the exact serial number of the unit delineates manufacturing break points the serial number is used to identify when a recorder manufacturer switched from a certain memory configuration to another this information is necessary to perform the correct recovery of the data
5813111 the safety board will include the manufacturer the part number and the serial number of the recorder in its formal reports if known
5813112 specifically the following information is required to facilitate data readout fdr part number and serial number
5813113 each recorder does have a unique serial number that is assigned by the manufacturer at the time it is made in addition to the unique serial number there is a part number that associates the unit with a particular family of recorders every recorder has a dataplate affixed to the outside of the unit stating the serial number part number date of manufacturer tso certification power requirements and weight the part number will stay the same even though subtle changes may be made during the manufacturing lifecycle of the recorder the manufacturer may change some components within the unit as long as the functionality and interchangeability of the unit remain the same this is where the serial number becomes important if a recorder with the same part number comes in we need to know what parts were used to make it and that is tracked by individual serial numbers of the recorder

5813141 there is nothing christian about handing the life of a woman over to burnt out old men setting in judgment bringing life into the world is a partnership between god and woman you cannot ever explain how god taking a baby at 1 5 or 7 months gestation or even full term can be explained and by the same laws of god no man certainly no lawyer or judge can explain the reasons a woman and her maker can come to a time in their relationship where a new life is terminated these are deep and profound issues between god and his children the moral ineptitude of church and state do not belong in the middle of a sacred partnership that women have with god that of bringing life into this world

5813159 until the 2000s when these structures became available you werent able to correlate where these signatures were with what was touching them in 3 d space
5813160 so nobody had ever done this sort of analysis before
5813161 the ramifications of this work are it gives you a much better way to probe how this universal machinery changes from one organism to another
5813162 in that the ribosome constitutes the core of the cellular translation mechanism which is the sine qua non of gene expression which is the essence of life as we know it these findings constitute a major step in understanding the evolution of life which is still a journey of a thousand miles

5813261 we found that mosquitoes can smell deet and they stay away from it
5813262 deet doesnt mask the smell of the host or jam the insects senses mosquitoes dont like it because it smells bad to them
5813263 for decades we were told that deet warded off mosquito bites because it blocked insect response to lactic acid from the host the key stimulus for blood feeding
5813264 dr leal and co workers escaped the key stimulus over simplification to show that mosquito responses like our own result from a balancing of various positive and negative factors all impinging on a tiny brain more capable than most people think of sophisticated decision making
5813265 one of the great attributes of science is that over time it is self correcting
5813266 i was so delighted when i first encountered the neuron that detects deet a synthetic compound
5813267 i couldnt believe my eyes because it goes against conventional wisdom so i repeated the experiment over and over until we discussed the findings in the lab
5813268 despite the fact that deet is the industry standard mosquito repellent relatively little is known about how it actually works
5813269 previous studies have suggested a masking or binding with host emanations understanding the mode of action is especially important because deet is used as the standard against which all other tentative replacement repellents are compared

5813291 in november 2004 i launched an investigation into possible medicaid prescription drug fraud and abuse in our states foster care system
5813292 i am here today to release disturbing information found during my investigation about the deaths poisonings rapes and pregnancies of children in our states foster care system
5813293 i found from information provided by the texas department of family and protective services in fiscal 2003

5813295 if you compare the number of deaths of children in our states population to the number of deaths in our states foster care system
5813296 based on fiscal 2004 data provided by the health and human services commission about 100 children received treatment for poisoning from medications
5813297 as alarming as these cases are we can only imagine how much worse the fiscal 2005 data is because gov perrys health and human services commission has refused to provide the data needed to complete my investigation
5813298 when i called on gov perry in october 2004 to create a crisis management team i said the crisis was minute by minute and child by child

5813307 much of the discussion in this thread is disgusting banner and marx are voices of reason and tera asks basic questions which are subsequently twisted beyond reason by what mras no way feminazis will be rubbing their dirty paws with glee at the attitudes here what people did four hundred years ago or in friggin okinawa or in the seedy suburbs of sydney is irrelevant they give absolutly no more impramatur to filthy behaviour than murder or mugging or rape do to try to use nature as an excuse is also sheer mendacity men control the dark side of their natures shits dont to put the blame entirely on immature girls is also a cop out to rabbit on about the feelings and desires of young boys as some sort rationale for an adult man to lust after children is disgraceful and has the child leading the man we are at war with the princess of lies sheer evil in a variety of forms to fight evil one must strive for personal purity it is difficult it is barely achievable unless you enter a monastery for 10 years but we stand no chance at all while attitudes that accept filth and excuse it is rife within this movement i rarely agree with robyork i hear his illuminati stuff and usually switch off where this evil comes from is not the point i agree with rob though that paedophila is a curse and a scourge and part of an evil which stalks our world not just the external world but also the inner world of some men and womens souls there are some people on this board who have made it onto my friend amfortas list they are not simply lost they are actively operating with the enemy they will go to the wall

5813345 a man who demands a relationship with a 12 year old is clearly not worried that the blatantly obvious mental differences will give him an immeasurable power over her just the same as a woman seeking a relationship with a 12yr old boy

5813360 nature has developed all of this firepower for getting things into cells and one of the ways is to create entities that are arginine rich
5813361 arginine rich sequences appear to figure in the mechanisms by which many pathogens invade cells
5813362 its an exciting result to be able to take a drug known to work against cancer but stymied by resistant cells and restore it to effectiveness using an arginine transporter
5813363 this bodes well for use with other drugs that succumb to resistance
5813364 in essence the technology can be used to overcome one of the most challenging types of problems of drug resistance
5813365 if youre not recognized as being part of the club then youre kicked out
5813366 if we think of the pump as being a bouncer for the cellular club then effectively what were doing is disguising one of these therapeutic agents to get it in through the back door or the side door
5813367 this could potentially be used with any drug which is effective but has a delivery problem
5813368 as the transporter with all these arginine guanidinium groups approaches the cell it basically does a handshake using hydrogen bonds with cell surface constituents that are in the membrane
5813369 in essence it changes its physical properties by shaking hands with all these cell membrane components
5813370 ovarian cancer has a drug taxol that works pretty well in the beginning seventy or eighty percent of the patients have a response

5813372 god forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion the people cannot be all and always well informed the part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive if they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is lethargy the forerunner of death to the public liberty and what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms the remedy is to set them right as to the facts pardon and pacify them what signify a few lives lost in a century or two the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure
5813373 how young is too young for women to marry men

5813377 i dont see why opposing violence against women automatically makes someone anti man men are naturally bigger and stronger than women they shouldnt have to use violence against them
5813378 our society looks down on people who beat children why because its someone hurting someone smaller and weaker than they are isnt that the same with women
5813379 im sorry but in my mind a real man with all the strength and authority of one would never find himself in a position of such threat where he would need to intentionally injure someone smaller and weaker than themselves
5813380 and cutting off of fingers and ears and shooting women in the stomach because of their political leanings is also seen by normal society as a sociopathic barbaric action rather then the choice of a rational enlightened human being

5813413 i was afraid of his claws i can tell you but i was pretty nearly desperate now so i just lay flat down on my back to let him do it the very first tear he made was do deep that i thought it had gone right into my heart and when he began pulling the skin off it hurt worse than anything ive ever felt the only thing that made me able to bear it was just the pleasure of feeling the stuff peel off you know if youve ever picked the scab of a sore place it hurts like billy oh but it is such fun to see it coming away well he peeled the beastly stuff right off just as i thought id done it myself the other three times only they hadnt hurt and there it was lying on the grass only ever so much thicker and darker and more knobbly looking than the others had been and there was i as smooth and soft as a peeled switch and smaller than i had been then he caught hold of me i didnt like that much for i was very tender underneath now that id no skin on and threw me into the water it smarted like anything but only for a moment after that it became perfectly delicious and as soon as i started swimming and splashing i found that all the pain had gone from my arm and then i saw why id turned into a boy again youd think me simply phoney if i told you how i felt about my own arms i know theyve no muscle and are pretty mouldy compared with caspians but i was so glad to see them after a bit the lion took me out and dressed me with his paws well i dont exactly remember that bit but he did somehow or other in new clothes the same ive got on now as a matter of fact and then suddenly i was back here which is what makes me think it must have been a dream

5813557 many white women have just as much of a problem with white men having black women on their arms as some black women do when they see black men with white women the only difference is that white women are a little less vocal about it i know because i have dated several white men and the evil stares and snide remarks from white women that i have received out number those even from black men
5813558 i keep hearing other black women complain about not being able to find a good working responsible black man yet i hear other people like yourself saying that their are plenty of them but black women are really only looking for the black bad boys do you actually think black women want the bad boys and not the secure men

5813578 dr blainey was in agreement with me that should mr bhadra re open the question of fairness of the gmcs decision all these arrangements would be immediately terminated there will be no further facilitation from this deanery or from that trust
5813579 she had warned me in writing on 10 august 1999 that if i made one more complaint against the gmcs unfairness the she and dr blainey will together terminate my retraining programme permanently
5813580 elisabeth paice london deanery director and one of authors said medicine has a hierarchical structure that gives people power over each other and that is an environment prone to bullying also medicine is stressful by nature and mistakes can cost lives so people are not as kind to each other in picking up mistakes as they could be

5813584 while entering menopause women often face stress and depressive symptoms memory problems sleeping disorders and impulsive moods
5813585 speaking to pulse professor paice said she felt compelled to complain to the postgraduate dean in the north scotland region professor gillian needham after seeing the excrementous style and scatological language used in the posting
5813586 dr joseph chikelue obi has publicly challenged professor carol black to stop behaving like a gossipy little despot
5813587 enough is enough we must all publicly challenge carol black to ethically submit full account of her stewardship for due public scrutiny as in my personal opinion she is a bloody waste of money and a serious danger to the public
5813588 professor gillian needham postgraduate medical dean and personal professor clinical university of aberdeen amp nhs education for scotland gillian graduated in medicine from manchester in 1981 becoming a fellow of the royal college of radiologists in 1986 a full time consultant radiologist for 10 years since 1999 she has been postgraduate dean in the north of scotland and during that time received honorary fellowships from the royal college of physicians edinburgh in 1999 and the royal college of surgeons edinburgh in 2007 she is a fellow of the higher education academy as one of 18 uk postgraduate deans gillian has responsibility for quality management of foundation programmes first 2 postgraduate years and specialty training programmes for doctors in training across the north of scotland under the statutory regulation of the general medical council gmc and postgraduate medical education and training board pmetb as a senior manager with the university of aberdeen and nhs education for scotland nes she contributes to a range of national projects and programmes and leads nes work stream on remote and rural healthcare education
5813589 to avoid bias on grounds of sex race disability lifestyle culture beliefs colour gender sexuality or age
5813590 to declare relevant interests or prior knowledge in the course of gmc business and or to take steps to avoid such interests or knowledge giving rise to a conflict of interest
5813591 professor carol black is not afraid to tackle difficult issues and she stirred controversy when she suggested that the large number of women going into medicine could see the profession being downgraded and becoming less influential
5813592 the college needs to reach out to physicians wherever they are further strengthening our regional offices developing regional educational programmes and making the college a reality for our fellows and members wherever they may be practicing i shall be totally committed to serving the fellows and members throughout the world and i will endeavour to build a healthy and robust relationship with government the department of health other royal colleges faculties and numerous other bodies
5813593 these aspirations encompass the creation of the right conditions in which doctors can deliver high quality medicine to the benefit of their patients and have a satisfying career with the infrastructural and educational facilities to support all this
5813594 professor dame carol black is president of the royal college of physicians of london she is a native of leicestershire where she attended barwell primary school and market bosworth grammar school she also attended leicester football club with her father rephrase it sounds like part of her education her route to the peak of the medical profession began at an improbable base camp she read history at bristol it seems likely that the analytical skills of that discipline constitute an element that is still present in her professional life after graduating she stayed on at bristol to take a diploma in medical social work also serving as president of the students union this was the 1960s so perhaps we may imagine dame carol as a radical idealist certainly bold radical thought and idealism are still part of her makeup on a trajectory that now seems inevitable carol black enrolled as what would now be called a mature student of medicine at bristol this was at a time when medical schools had gender quotas and age limits as part of their admissions policies nonetheless she secured a place and she flourished working during the vacations as a ward orderly in leicester royal infirmary the question of women in medicine is one to which she was to return as a public figure in a widely quoted statement that was both misunderstood and misrepresented she suggested that the large number of women now going into medicine could see the profession being downgraded and becoming less influential this was taken quite wrongly to imply that fewer women should enter medicine at bristol carol black trained with alan read the professor of medicine and found herself drawn to rheumatology and connective tissue disorders these have proved to be the interests of an entire career and she has moved both forward after bristol she moved to taplow where she worked with barbara ansell and then to the postgraduate medical school at hammersmith her clinical work during this period gave rise to a research interest in systemic sclerosis a disorder that frustrated attempts to alleviate its spread through the body because it was imperfectly understood her unit at the royal free hospital in hampstead has become the european centre for clinical care and research into this condition do we need to list all of these it needs to be more selective one of the paradoxes of careers in medicine is that its finest clinicians and researchers achieve a pre eminence that takes them away for substantial portions of their working weeks from their clinical and scientific work ten years ago carol black was elected to the council of the royal college of physicians and in 1999 she was elected clinical vice president in 1999 in 2002 she was elected president of the royal college of physicians the assumption of this role inevitably leads to a burgeoning of invitations to serve on other bodies including in dame carols case the council of the academy of medical science the nhs institute for innovation and improvement the imperial cancer research fund council the national leadership network for health and social care the nhs widening participation in learning strategy unit the national specialist commissioning advisory group the medical leaders professional council of the british association of medical managers the uk clinical research collaborative and the postgraduate medical education and training board she also serves as a trustee of the tancred charity and the picker institute of europe and as a governor of the health foundation and goodenough college talented members of such bodies inevitably are good targets for positions of responsibility so she has become co chair of the physiological measurement leadership group vice chair of the academy of medical royal colleges and chair of the federation of royal colleges of physicians of the united kingdom one wonders when she has time to sleep much less practise medicine somehow she manages on top of these and other responsibilities to write scientific and medical papers and to indulge passions for long distance walking theatre opera and house renovation inevitably she has been honoured dame carol is a master of the american college of physicians and a fellow of 15 medical royal colleges and faculties she is even a companion of the chartered management institute an honour that one does not ordinarily associate with medicine in 2005 she became a dame commander of the order of the british empire mr chancellor on the recommendation of senate and council i present to you dame carol black that you may confer upon her the degree of doctor of science

5813600 security officers from a private company that were patrolling the area disturbed the thieves and they made off on foot without the parts
5813601 accused one najwa was almost like a tour guide in her house
5813602 she led accused 3 to that room and to her son and room
5813603 i said i did not mean to kick you so hard i will wipe it off
5813604 when are you going to finish with him when are you going to shoot him
5813605 at that moment the deceased said to me i have children dont kill me i told him no ones going to be killed thats not how i understand the thing
5813606 i said i did not come here to kill people fuck the job
5813607 the controversy over the planned development allegations that raw sewage is already pouring into the dam as well as serious allegations made in a tv report on 50 50 a conservation programme we request the premier to urgently appoint a commission of enquiry
5813608 the damage caused nationally and internationally over the suspension of three senior conservation officials who worked closely with the flamingo project is huge
5813609 however that removal provision now sits alongside a set of clauses that propose the dissolution of the entire board and the installation of a small hand picked interim board without any transparent process
5813610 that is offensive intimidatory and destructive of the security of tenure without which this body cannot protect section 16 editorial independence and the right of the public to be informed
5813611 it also puts on public display the intentions of the ruling portion of the ruling party
5813612 obviously the thinking is that the polokwane faction in parliament will decide and the new chairperson of that party will force the president to execute that decision
5813613 but that is the most primitive form of power politics it cannot be the law because it is unconstitutional
5813614 the proposition that an entire board of the sabc can be removed not by due enquiry but merely after a finding of a committee of the national assembly is quite simply outrageous
5813615 it is a patently obvious intra party political manoeuvre and in so doing this honourable house is being used as a tool for the political machinations of the new post polokwane ruling clique of the anc
5813616 we cannot and will not support bad law this bill is bad law
5813617 if that happened well be ready to deal with whatever issues
5813618 this is a heavy load whose ramifications were just beginning to digest obviously it has impacted us and we are just beginning to feel the strain
5813619 champion of democracy in his own country and throughout africa
5813620 i visited mike right before camp and i had a chance to sit down with him and talk with him about a lot of things dealing with life
5813621 i tried not talk too much about football but just whats going to happen when he gets out eventually and just being there in support of him as ive been this is a situation where i could go and sit down with a guy and not have to worry about telling the world
5813622 i believe the people deserve better i think its an insult to the people to say this is a second job
5813623 i hope he gets to the point where he can take on two jobs and do them well
5813624 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0
5813625 the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes
5813626 change is pain organizational change is unexpectedly difficult because it provokes sensations of physiological discomfort
5813627 vigorous writing is concise a sentence should contain no unnecessary words a paragraph no unnecessary sentences for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts
5813628 the adjective hasnt been built that can pull a weak or inaccurate noun out of a tight place
5813629 six year old boy the story is that he took a dump this morning and it was bright red no stomach pain might have had a similar poop last night no vomiting heart rate is stable no signs of dehydration or shock kid is in no apparent distress
5813630 no so the resident does a digital rectal exam and his glove comes out bright red and covered in poo the resident smears his glove on a fobt a strip of paper that turns color when poo with blood gets smeared on it even if the blood is not visible to the naked eye and the strip never changes color
5813631 so either the strip is defective or its not really blood
5813632 no then we asked the boy to pee in a cup why
5813633 yes because eating too many beets can color your poop and your pee
5813634 he doesnt seem to be in distress hes too young for colon cancer diverticulitis or ulcers
5813635 so the resident is totally clueless we talk to the attending and the attending laughs he says that a couple years ago when red hot cheetos hit the market there was a huge outbreak of kids with bright red poo and this was the case
5813636 tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last
5813637 one of the biggest problems with categorizing things in advance is that it forces the categorizers to take on two jobs that have historically been quite hard mind reading and fortune telling
5813638 first we get leeches and let them suck our blood then we pull the leeches away and crush them to get the blood we put the blood in a trap and when the mosquito comes to suck the blood poop they get trapped
5813639 for more than 50 years now we have been living in the era of television politics in the 1950s television first began to have a major impact on politics and the results were overwhelming

5813669 too many technology classes are about reaching goals that trainers have set rather than teaching skills that students actually need ive chosen the road less traveled teaching concepts that people can build on for years rather than steps that they can use for months the differences between being technology challenged and being technology literate are similar to the differences between being an inexperienced traveler and being a savvy traveler so it follows that a good technology trainer is like a good tour guide handling logistical details and creating experiences that are customized to meet individual interests and that will empower travelers to take future trips on their own

5813679 they come right out of the 60s to a lot of people it looks almost like theyre from a different planet
5813680 the hardest part is trying to be a leader because guys look at you and see that youre splitting reps with another guy and theyre not so sure if youre the guy
5813681 kodi and chris are both a little bit tired their arms are tired
5813682 theyre hanging in there as you need your quarterbacks to do you need them to step up and show the players around them that they can withstand anything just like they can you need good camaraderie and you need good leadership out of your quarterbacks and both these guys are good friends who are competing well
5813683 i remember thinking about it that night said boldon who took the bronze medal
5813684 and i said to myself when i die thats still going to be the record boldon was 22 years old at the time no sprinter has come within three tenths of a second since that night
5813685 if he gets someone to push him through the corner turn we could see something unbelievable im thinking between 19 22 and 19 26
5813686 i think hell run 19 5 something said johnson who is in beijing as
5813687 will he be able to sustain what we saw the other day which was incredible
5813688 speed endurance is something different where youve got to hold that speed for a much longer time and that doesnt come into play in the 100 meters johnson says
5813689 it becomes an endurance issue the 200 is just a different feel
5813690 and now eventually does he run faster than 19 32 i think its inevitable
5813691 michael was running against somebody who had just beaten him and on a track where he had already broken a very old world record said fredericks
5813692 this made for very good conditions for him to run fast
5813693 we all ran an extremely good bend but michael ran away from me in the final 100 meters said fredericks
5813694 nobody else ever did that to me before in my entire career but i feel blessed and happy that i was part of such a great race
5813695 at the time in 1996 i thought that michaels record would stand for a long time said fredericks
5813696 it could still stand for a long time there is no guarantee
5813697 most of us as track fans would have liked to have seen what he would have run if he had run through the finish
5813698 but then i dont see him coming home as fast as michael did maybe 9
5813699 there was just a little too much im better than you to the other guys he said
5813700 i said that on air and ive been getting hate mail from jamaicans for three days
5813701 it if was me id take down the 100 even further this year johnson said
5813702 because he can take that down somewhere that nobody else is going to get it for a while
5813703 im going to run my heart out but right now its kind of hard said bolt
5813704 ive run four rounds of the 100 and now three rounds of the 200 so its kind of hard to go out there and set the record
5813705 these guys have been running in that gap between the old record and my record johnson said
5813706 guys should have been doing more even before they did
5813707 you cant think that people are going to keep running fast
5813708 you are a weasel and a horrible journalist i would honestly rather you didnt even mention wvu anymore even if you do have something good to say because coming from you it really doesnt mean much
5813709 welcome to the beautiful hills of west virginia were glad to have you
5813710 a fitting and most likely disastrous end to one of the most dim witted coaching searches ive ever witnessed
5813711 the chances of stewart maintaining the programs recent level of success are about as high as leaving a party at lindsay lohan s place with your fur coat in tact
5813712 were in the greatest country in the world one where a critics opinion is not only welcomed its almost expected and wanted
5813713 so if theres a booster here or there that doesnt like me being named coach hes got the right to say that but i also live in this same country and these players and this staff live in this same country and we have every right to prove the naysayers wrong
5813714 people say im like a grandpa im such a nice guy
5813715 well i am a nice guy ive got emotions too and i get pissed like everyone else but you cant let the players see that youve got to be in control
5813716 its time we designers stop thinking of ourselves as merely pixel people and start thinking of ourselves as the creators of experiences and when it comes to experience on the web theres no better way to create it than to write and write well
5813717 design is about communication and it takes more than pixels to communicate design is about communication and it takes more than pixels to communicate

5813722 it was television more than anything else that turned the tide
5813723 whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp drizzly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking peoples hats off then i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can
5813724 i really dont know why it is that all of us are so committed to the sea except i think its because in addition to the fact that the sea changes and the light changes and ships change its because we all came from the sea and it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean and therefore we have salt in our blood our sweat and in our tears we are tied to the ocean and when we go back to the sea whether it is to sail or to watch it we are going back from whence we came

5813728 hes been a warrior for this organization and hes done a great job for this football team for me since ive been here the last couple of years

5813732 it looks like were pretty fortunate there im going to list him as day to day right now
5813733 i just have to take it one day at a time
5813734 you know its early in the week and early in the injury all i know is that its sore and a little tight
5813735 it basically brings about the importance of these young players getting better
5813736 you know chris brown and steve slaton and im going to give them a chance to do that
5813737 i guess that was when i kind of discovered i had a special knack for finding my way to the ball and it was more fun making the tackles is much more fun than blocking
5813738 but deep down hes very competitive hes really out here every day trying to do everything he can to be the best in the business hes got all the tools
5813739 i just want to continue to do what ive been doing concentrate on trying to get better
5813740 my main focus is to just try to make myself better and try to make this defense better overall thats my only goal just to do my part
5813741 weve found that we can give him quite a bit of responsibility and he can handle it
5813742 you have to take what you learn in the classroom and bring it out here to the field
5813743 he comes out here and executes it exactly day in and day out no matter how much weve installed
5813744 there are always plays that you wish you could have back
5813745 the film is always going to be there nobodys ever going to go out and have a perfect game you have mental busts brain freezes things just happen or you may think you really hit someone and youre the one who ends up stunned
5813746 i see things i do wrong all the time i still think i can get so much better
5813747 hes a real scrappy guy you look at him hes a smaller guy but he goes out and plays with a big heart
5813748 it doesnt surprise you when he comes out there and starts to do that
5813749 hes tough and he understands the game the quarterbacks trust him if he continues at the pace hes going hes going to play a lot for this team
5813750 he just felt a little tweak i guess but i dont know
5813751 he feels good right now but we wont know for sure for a couple of hours
5813752 we feel pretty good about where hes at hopefully with no setback
5813753 blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

5813916 the closer we get to steins the more accurate our knowledge of the asteroids position relative to rosetta will be
5813917 thanks to rosettas cameras we will obtain increasingly precise measurements that will allow us to adjust again if necessary rosettas orbit for an optimal asteroid encounter
5813918 both of rosettas navigation cameras could already see the asteroid from the very beginning of the tracking campaign despite the long distance from steins and contrary to what we expected
5813919 the exceptional quality of the osiris scientific camera namely its angular resolution provided data as accurate as expected and made our current trajectory calculations very precise
5813920 it is the first time ever that we have used optical instrumentation on board a scientific spacecraft for navigation as opposed to the usual techniques based on analyzing radio signals
5813921 the exceptional results are really encouraging and we look forward to using this technique again in the future if and when it is possible

5813969 we connected the dots to draw a critical conclusion and found evidence over the amazon that traces the direct path of the effect of human activity on climate change by way of human caused aerosols
5813970 during the dry season in the amazon the only aerosols of any magnitude are from smoke emerging from human initiated fires
5813971 scientists have observed instances where increases or decreases in the amount of these tiny particles have increased and decreased cloud cover in different places and times
5813972 we saw an example of this ourselves increased aerosols over the amazon produced less cloud cover over the atlantic ocean however increased aerosols actually produced more cloud cover we wanted to know what the link was between these different outcomes from varying amounts and types of aerosols this paper gives us a clear picture of what is occurring
5813973 this result helps us understand aerosols effect on a clouds mass and lifetime how long it will provide cloud cover how deep the clouds will be and when and where it will rain
5813974 this improved understanding leads to prediction and prediction can help us plan and perhaps prevent some of the potential consequences of putting aerosols from human activity into the atmosphere
5813975 as wed expected in applying our model increased smoke from the fires created clouds rife with a more pronounced radiative effect rich with human caused aerosols that absorbed sunlight warmed the local atmosphere and blocked evaporation this led to reduced cloud cover over the amazon
5813976 and its encouraging to know the science behind our model should stand no matter the region

5813978 a loss of 1 8 billion or more instead of the modest profit they previously expected if the dour projections come true lehmans losses since the start of march would total at least 4 5 billion or more than the firm churned out in profit during fiscal 2007
5813979 obviously the american mer rovers spirit and opportunity that were put up by nasa enjoyed an extreme amount of success they were able to travel large distances well beyond their planned lifetimes but were hoping that with our baby well be able to go places that are actually much further
5813980 its quite a tense period for us in astrium and for the other companies involved in building exomars and for all the many many scientists who will depend on this mission
5813981 on the one hand we are moving ahead with a great momentum as youve seen this is not a paper project there is real engineering going on and we are on the verge of building the real hardware that will go on to the planet mars
5813982 but on the other hand we do have a real problem in order to complete the project further funding needs to be made available and it wont be until november that we are sure that that is in place
5813983 the uk will be working with its international partners to try to bring about a mission that has high impact and is affordable in a process of negotiation that will culminate in decisions at the ministerial in november 2008
5813984 meanwhile it remains a high strategic priority for the uk as emphasized previously

5814009 we dont have the processes in space to remove excess heat or keep the spacecraft warm in excess cold
5814010 it may sound very trivial but controlling the temperature of a spacecraft is absolutely crucial currently there is no way to do it for very small spacecraft
5814011 the test for micrometeoroids was very simple we just fired a gun loaded with small particles and tiny harpoon like needles at it
5814012 this work represents a radical improvement over prior work presented by this firm in incorporating a protective layer that drastically lowers the solar absorptance to an acceptable value
5814013 the variable emittance electrochromic technology is an entirely new technology pioneered by this firm to the best of our knowledge no other group has done any work in this area
5814014 a lot of spacecraft engineers have come to us saying if we had this technology it would give us much greater design freedom for future micro spacecraft
5814015 it shows that nwacc and the program have undergone a strict review of the faculty student achievement curriculum and overall college services it usually takes at least five years to be granted approval and a number of programs do not receive it on the first try
5814016 this group recognized the need to increase training options for legal support staff
5814017 in fact our law firm recently hired a current student in the nwacc paralegal program
5814018 the program works well for those who need to work while getting their training because many of the program classes are available in the evenings
5814019 the classes are structured to meet the needs of working adults and are offered at night during the day and in both fayetteville and bentonville
5814020 students are encouraged to start working full or part time in a legal setting after their first semester as the curriculum combines practical skills with legal theory
5814021 our graduates are in demand and are employed by a number of companies and business
5814022 about a third work at wal mart corporate offices the rest are with private law firms local businesses and governmental agencies
5814023 fortunately because of the tremendous growth in the area jobs have been plentiful
5814024 every semester i have more jobs than graduates or students to fill them
5814025 the good thing about the hearing is you provide publicity as to whats the proper thing to do as far as jobs people returning from service and things like that when you get these witnesses testifying they really do offer a lot of good suggestions

5814027 could have formed like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked a large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus
5814028 one of our goals is to understand the origin of comets which are among the most spectacular celestial events but the deeper goal is to look back into the early history of our solar system and piece together what was happening when the planets formed
5814029 the board would be similar doing everything it does now
5814030 we asked some tough questions and i think we got very good answers

5814253 objective in designing this car was to offer value minded buyers the chance to have the performance and luxury of a 45 000 to 50 000 car for a price 9 000 to 15 000 less

5814261 although transracial adoption originally referred to the adoption of african american children into white families these placements have declined since 1972 when the national association of black social workers publicly criticized this practice
5814262 it is documented that more than 250 000 international adoptions took place between 1971 and 2001 and there are currently over 1 5 million adopted children living in the u s today however there are no firm statistics kept on how many of those adoptions are transracial
5814263 because we are linked by blood and blood is memory without language
5814264 through transracial adoption children are placed in permanent loving families and have access to economic well being healthcare and continuing education
5814265 now the biggest wave of transracial adoptees has reached adulthood
5814266 an adoptees dual identity is one of nature and nurture the genetic traits and temperament given by the biological parents and the values views and privileges bestowed by the adoptive parents
5814267 my experience as a transracial adoptee can be best described in a metaphor of gardening terms
5814268 for every anthropomorphized pear in an apple tree there will inevitably be questions what were my roots like that made me look this way
5814269 how would it feel if i were an apple what would it have been like to grow up with all pears even if there was no sun and the ground was soggy
5814270 many issues complicate the lives of tras and each adoptee copes with them differently
5814271 what differentiates the content tras from the next two groups is that they feel a lesser degree of cultural loss they feel happy within their adoptive families lucky that they escaped whatever conditions of their birth and they are not as interested in seeking their roots
5814272 the concerned tras have a strong sense of cultural loss
5814273 the last group of tras feels that they have been abducted from their birth families and robbed of their culture
5814274 though the editors from outsiders within say there is no homogenous transracial adoptee story 3 5 it is true that there are commonalities that link all adoptees in all categories though they may experience these commonalities to a different scale
5814275 adoptive parents want to do what is right for their children but how can they know how to guide and provide for tras since children in this situation are all so different
5814276 it is important for tras to be exposed to people who look similar to them
5814277 though adoptive parents should make sure they have the assets to take trips back to tras birth countries and that the children have access to a legitimate view of their birth cultures parents should not force the cultures on the children
5814278 parents should recognize and not tolerate behavior that makes tras uncomfortable
5814279 as the voices of the young adult tras become louder new concerns question todays adoption process
5814280 adoption does two things provides children with families and provides families with children
5814281 cheri register may have the right idea on how to rectify the system rather than serving would be parents needs as supply and demand dictates international adoption should be governed by a concern that puts greater emphasis on keeping families intact and daily life sustainable in countries where transracial adoptees are born 11
5814282 transracial adoption may not be the ideal solution but it is a valuable alternative when faced with the choice of having children growing up in orphanages all over the world or forming families through transracial adoption the choice is clear there is a crisis at hand and transracial adoption is the best option for abandoned children however there are many flaws with this practice as tras have told us and these problems must be dealt with to ensure an even better life for the next generation of transracial adoptees

5814371 yes brian had a rough time of it with his mental health but i would kill to have the kind of catalogue he does and tour everywhere with his brothers like he did
5814372 when i go to the keyboard i feel holy like an angel over my head i feel very holy when we did the beach boys hit god only knows i felt holy about that too a godly something comes through me
5814373 im always thinking about melodies the melodies come from my brain and my keyboards i play a really pleasant keyboard it sounds so pleasant it makes me want to write melodies
5814374 sometimes i want to get out of the house to get away from my kids but i love my kids a lot i love my kids quiet time comes around 10 at night when i go to sleep its peace of mind things run smoothly at night during the day things are more rough
5814375 i dont talk to them very much i used to i recorded with them at one time but i dont talk to them a lot
5814376 we dont want any publicity about me getting back with the beach boys cause i dont want to theyre not my group anymore thats mike and bruces group now im on my own and i would rather do that than go back to the beach boys

5814386 we were backstage at the mtv malaysian music awards where we had presented an award she turned round to us and said im mad into your music
5814387 we were like f king hell because i am like a superfan of hers
5814388 i know she came off a reality show and maybe it is not the most admirable thing to do but she is amazing
5814389 i would love to get into her head a little bit when we sit down to write with people we really get to know them and their strengths
5814390 she is amazing and i think the best is yet to come i hope we can be the ones to pull it out
5814391 we got an email from leonas boyfriend asking when we were playing next as they want to see us perform
5814392 he is going to come down and hang out with us when she has some time off
5814393 he is such a normal down to earth lad i think without him she might even go off the rails a bit but he seems such a top bloke
5814394 i love oasis but it was crazy to hear that
5814395 i love acting and would love to do more projects but i think it confused people a bit
5814396 its tougher for people to crossover here than it is in america
5814397 i was really encouraged after doing the play as well because i got some good reviews from theatre critics who are known for being quite harsh
5814398 ive never been so excited about a record im having the best time ever
5814399 no guys have even talked to us maybe theyre intimidated
5814400 before the saturdays took off we made a pact that we were allowed one celebrity snog each
5814401 but now weve had a hit he is worried it might actually happen
5814402 life is good but im really tired with all the travelling
5814403 it is a lovely place but i havent been back for quite a while and i think it will be very different when i do
5814404 in my mind it hasnt changed a bit everyone is still drinking in the same bar dancing in the same club people are still in the same darts team
5814405 we have a man who works in the local chippie called dick fish because in wales they call you by what you do so im duffy cantores which means singer
5814406 but im freaking out that when i go back people will think ive changed everyone has been so supportive i dont want them to feel let down
5814407 if id lived in a big city there would have been more distractions and i wouldnt have focused on me like i did in nefyn
5814408 being a singer was a really unusual choice to have made but i got to do it cos there was nothing around
5814409 there was no cinema no youth clubs no nothing not many people even leave to go to uni where we lived buying a box of hair dye was a really really big night out
5814410 i went through a wild spell which i used to give myself a hard time about i had piercings and really cropped hair
5814411 some of my friends had run ins with the police too but i was just naughty duffy whod stand in the background not saying anything
5814412 i love the smell of fresh mowed rained on grass its brilliant and under the sun its even better
5814413 there was no overnight switch its just one of those things where everybody grows up from 15 to 23
5814414 i live on my own and i make choices for myself im an adult and i feel like i see the world every day in a bigger picture
5814415 ive never been a very censored girl even when i was a kid i was always saying what i felt
5814416 i knew that it was gonna make a splash but i didnt know that it was going to be such a huge cannonball
5814417 so im happy that it did im excited that it did
5814418 we were working with the same producer in new york city
5814419 at the end of my trip it was just when i first started going to new york and not really knowing anybody i was like please god somebody take me out
5814420 so i made him take me out all of his friends were there and we ended up dancing and making out on the dancefloor
5814421 because you have seen me you have believed blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed
5814422 that is life at a big club if you come to chelsea you have to expect competition i thrive on it
5814423 there are always big name players here i love competing with them and i love learning from them it can only make me a better player
5814424 it is early days and you cant take too much from the first game however we watched united beat fulham 5 1 a couple of years ago and we were thinking look at them they look strong
5814425 they must have watched us against portsmouth and thought we looked strong
5814426 the first game is over its great for everyone and great for the manager because of all the expectation
5814427 but this was a great start opening day of the season you always want to be at home and you want to have a good start this is a cracking squad and this is a cracking result
5814428 it was nice to score i was trying to play a bit further up because we have a lot of mid fielders who like to play deep
5814429 we play five in midfield and im the one who likes to run in behind we looked like a cohesive unit
5814430 i think this could be our central partnership for the next five years
5814431 colocinni has signed for five years and so has steven so everything is there
5814432 the club has tried a few partnerships but for one reason or another they have not worked the signs are good from that first game and we hope they can build on it
5814433 when we saw him train with the lads i said to terry mac wow he will just love going to old trafford added keegan
5814434 he came to me and said he wanted to play and that was it ive told steven to watch and learn from this guy
5814435 if he does that then he will make the step up from under 21s to where colocinni is at full international level
5814436 hopefully i will get a few more chances to play with him
5814437 i hope to get more chances like this so i am sticking around for a bit
5814438 obviously you want everything to go well on your debut i didnt think we got the result we deserved but i did really enjoy myself
5814439 playing with wayne rooney is the same as any partnership you have to learn about each others game but hopefully i will get a few more chances to play with him
5814440 i cant put into words what it was like to start in front of 76 000 at old trafford
5814441 it is what i have been working for since i joined the club
5814442 it didnt happen in the first couple of games last season either but hopefully the same thing will happen and we can really kick on and put the chances away and win matches
5814443 he has looked so sharp to get a pre season behind him which he never had last year was vital
5814444 with that behind him he was on to something special but he will be back
5814445 it was disappointing to lose him with our shortage of numbers up front at the moment but we still should have been good enough to win
5814446 those players will come back and we will be a formidable squad
5814447 i didnt carry a knife but i was probably around people who did
5814448 what the top players look for is a captain who steps forward in bad times when things go wrong thats when you want leadership
5814449 there is so much more to being a footballer today especially with the media attention the captain has to embrace all the off pitch stuff
5814450 you have to live your life right on and off the pitch and there will be times when we make mistakes and the captain can help any of us deal with criticism
5814451 the captain is the link between the manager and the team if the manager wants the boys thinking in a certain way that comes through the captain
5814452 it can also be something silly like us wanting to eat an hour earlier to watch the olympics and the captain goes and asks the question
5814453 it matters who it is although the atmosphere will not change whoever he picks will be the right decision
5814454 we have so many leaders in the squad with the united chelsea and liverpool captains all here
5814455 both rio and john have got the attributes we are talking about the respect of the others top internationals at their peak vocal in the dressing room and who lead by example
5814456 i havent achieved what i want as an international footballer because my ambition is to win a major tournament
5814457 winning is what it is about and we need to put it right
5814458 what we must do is learn how to play and win under pressure
5814459 that is the hardest obstacle on the way to the world cup winning under pressure some players do it better than others
5814460 there is a psychological barrier and it has to be mastered
5814461 playing for chelsea and england is so different we have to build the confidence at international level
5814462 the country also needs to produce better players and we need to get better
5814463 with all respect to the olympics and how prestigious it is football is the national game its what every kid wants to do and it takes everyone to a different level
5814464 im not taking away anything from what all the medal winners have done but it is up to us the players and the people at the fa to make sure we start winning
5814465 i was embarrassed watching the european championships because the others were there and we werent
5814466 the downs always drive you on and it is important to use it as an energy for the next campaign and here we are again
5814467 football often gets stick at times like this when there is another sport doing well and it is partly our own fault
5814468 we could do more on and off the pitch the public have lost patience with us because of the money and everything when you step out on that pitch it isnt about money its about pride
5814469 this squad under its new coach needs a competitive game
5814470 it is very important to me that england do well im a fan just like everyone we take responsibility for the failure
5814471 i think everybody realises it means the world to me to retain the armband
5814472 to get the armband back is a huge achievement for me
5814473 it was about an hour ago just after training the manager called the whole squad together and told us as a whole
5814474 for me to get it above the likes of him ferdinand and the other players in the squad is a great honour

5814478 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5814479 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5814480 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team

5814504 the idea that wearing a bra encourages cancer by trapping toxins was recently put forward by researchers at the institute for culturogenic studies sic in hawaii researchers from more august establishments promptly dismissed it as claptrap
5814505 there are no scientifically valid studies that show a correlation between wearing bras of any type and the occurrence of breast cancer two anthropologists made this association in a book called dressed to kill their study was not conducted according to standard principles of epidemiological research and did not take into consideration other variables including known risk factors for breast cancer there is no other credible research to validate this claim in any way

5814550 for me a worrying area is when people call a class of learners a cop and say that learning is the practice
5814551 often communities evolve from interest to learning to practice is it developmental
5814552 the opportunity to step up and step into roles that this event provided and the shared sense of the value of being together that evolved through the activity

5814573 the beta sdk that were releasing today is the first big step on the sdks road to compatibility with 1 0 since this is a beta release applications developed with it may not quite be compatible with devices running the final android 1 0 however the apis are now pretty stable and we dont expect any major changes if youre one of the many developers who were waiting for something a bit more mature this might be a good time to take another look
5814574 due to the security risks inherent in accepting arbitrary data from outside the device the data messaging facility of the gtalkservice will not be present in android 1 0 the gtalkservice will provide connectivity to googles servers for google talk instant messaging but the api has been removed from this release while we improve the service note that this will be a google specific service and is not part of the core of android

5814584 we could have used a little but we didnt need a gullywasher
5814585 the ground is so hard here because were in a drought and when the rain came down so fast it just flooded
5814586 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
5814587 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
5814588 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
5814589 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
5814590 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be

5814593 the ability to talk to a search engine is perhaps the simplest its ever been
5814594 those are the three things that i believe are going to cause search to change
5814595 you can see that today in what we have done with image search what we have done with video search
5814596 to say that were not a media company would be hypocrisy
5814597 ive not been successful in finding the right price and the right camera on google
5814598 i could see live search was different the fact that its different i think means its going to have some potential

5814602 as the number of cores in cpus increases the demand for more and more memory inside microprocessors grows dramatically making sure that we can continue to grow memory on microprocessors is a basic requirement for scaling
5814603 we can continue the scaling or miniaturization of the circuits for several more generations there is still a lot more room for development
5814604 technology is a tool to address some of the worlds most pressing challenges related to health care education economic development and the environment
5814605 no nations or individuals are untouched by these issues get involved be part of the solution
5814606 it was a thoughtful piece focusing on what technology can do rather than focusing on 45 nanometer technology

5814609 this is part of a larger recognition and effort by large it vendors that they need to do more to encourage innovation around the world
5814610 really its about pushing that information out to end users
5814611 bringing the end user into the whole problem of master data management
5814612 that strategy execution loop is of no value if you dont trust the data thats feeding you
5814613 do you have data integrity around that to be able to make business changes based on those risk thresholds that you set
5814614 so you dont have to do it over and over

5814631 why i felt our assessment was better than the other one
5814632 could we have been this far off the track in our selection or is your assessment that good
5814633 what about the customization did we make selections that caused these people to look as if they didnt fit did we make the hiring criteria too difficult

5814638 there can be no business as usual with russia under present circumstances
5814639 the united states sought precisely what we got in this statement which is most importantly support for georgias democracy
5814640 secondly a very strong message that the russian president ought to keep his word and third a very clear statement of principle from this alliance that a new line in europe where russia somehow asserts that there are those who cannot opt for a transatlantic future is unacceptable
5814641 the behavior of russia in this most recent crisis is isolating russia when you start invading small neighbors bombing civilian infrastructure going into villages and wreaking havoc and wanton destruction of this infrastructure thats what isolates russia
5814642 targeting nato allies in this case poland if i use the phrase unhelpful rhetoric i would react much too mildly it is pathetic rhetoric
5814643 oh honey i dont have a drill that will go through that and well cut ourselves to pieces on those sharp edges besides do you really want to look at a 3 by 4 sheet metal box in the backyard especially once it rusts

5814649 in america were a frontier nation and so the idea is that just beyond the next ridge is the perfect farmland a giant oil field or an abundant supply of timber
5814650 people dont like the idea that the frontier is now closed and weve got to live within limits
5814651 i grew up as a pretty good miler and running was integrally part of my character
5814652 when i was not recruited to the university of washington track team but rather the rowing team it took a lot of prayer to let go of the old and try the new little did i know that god made me perfectly to row
5814653 the technical changes i acquired helped me to get more out of each row
5814654 also my strength has increased as a result of these more efficient rowing practices i have no regrets and feel ready for my best in beijing
5814655 one of the coaches i met said i could take rowing as far as i wanted before i had ever even taken a stroke and she was so sincere
5814656 she really believed so i thought why not give it a try for a year two olympic games four world titles and four ncaa championship trophies later im still at it
5814657 my youth pastor helped me to see that even though i was a really good kid i wasnt perfect and i needed jesus so that i could be in a right relationship with god
5814658 i gave my life to jesus and my life has never been the same
5814659 its my third olympics but its also going to be my last olympics its kind of a farewell at the same time i get really excited but really emotional about it a lot
5814660 really got into church and gods word and was really excited about it
5814661 diving was the only stable thing i had in my life
5814662 i didnt think i was going to survive the meet
5814663 i was so disoriented and i was terrified i realized in the middle of that meet that id taken control of things and everything was slipping through my fingers i had just made a mess of stuff
5814664 he gave me this talent and i want to worship him with it and glorify him with it i know i dont have to win to do that whatever place i come in hes going to be glorified through that if i honor him i want to be a graceful winner and i want to be a graceful loser
5814665 i would say shes larger than life but thats not the first thing that comes across when you meet her shes a real person very humble about all of that stuff
5814666 i had to win everything i took part in to maintain my self esteem i was angry at god for allowing her to die and often viewed my life as unfair
5814667 during my teenage years i felt a great need to leave new zealand and explore the world i wanted to be in control of my future i wanted popularity money and fame i thought a running scholarship to america was my ticket to happiness
5814668 all i had achieved was nothing compared to missing my mother blaming god if he even existed for her unfair death
5814669 in depression i felt like i had nowhere else to go i needed guidance and a direction with real purpose
5814670 jesus showed me how we can live life to the fullest
5814671 rather than seeking money or power he chose to help feed the hungry and heal the sick jesus lived a perfect life never deceiving or hurting anyone many people started following jesus and cheered that he would become their new king
5814672 the leaders in power became fearful of jesus so they decided to have him killed jesus did not run or hide but chose to accept this fate
5814673 the coolest thing about jesus is that although he was the son of god and had the ability to do anything he still allowed the soldiers to nail him to a cross his innocence has now made it possible for all of us who are guilty to be forgiven and set free from our sin
5814674 he came into my heart and swept me clean all the anger and bitterness towards my mothers death became healed and i was ready to restart my life fresh
5814675 god is real and he walks alongside me every day he convicts me when i stray and loves me when im lonely nothing i have done during my life has allowed me to deserve this my selfish existence is proof that god can and wants to forgive everyone we just have to ask
5814676 jesus is not about religion he is a living god who wants to be a part of our lives he knows we are messed up and struggle with different temptations he wants to help free us so we can enjoy life to the full not live a boring life following strict rules and regulations
5814677 running with all my heart is a way for me to thank god for the opportunities and gifts he has given me
5814678 as i train for the olympics i constantly remind myself that all i have comes from god and without him i would not be the person i am today
5814679 whether i win or lose i believe that god gets great joy when i approach my training working and racing with an attitude of power love and discipline
5814680 i also try to adopt this same view when it comes to other areas of my life besides running
5814681 when we were in africa we didnt know what was there for us as kids we just ran
5814682 god was planning all of this stuff for me and i didnt know
5814683 were totally conscious of the responsibility that we have to be role models to the kids
5814684 weve continued to race whether theres 700 on the line or now olympic glory on the line
5814685 its something we do because we love it but now to finally have the kind of recognition and to put us on the world stage is something that we really cant even describe right now
5814686 weve all had numerous new sponsors and tv time that weve never had before
5814687 but i dont think until we walk into beijing and are then truly a part of the olympics will we realize how big this thing is
5814688 we watch what we eat we have to train every day were totally conscious of the responsibility that we have to be role models to the kids
5814689 ive always wanted to be the best and its kind of a great time now to educate parents and kids of new generations about this sport
5814690 it kind of made me realize that theres no reason why i shouldnt be giving my life to the lord
5814691 bmx as a sport is not really one where you see a lot of christian athletes speak out about their beliefs
5814692 i understand that everything that ive been given and been allowed to do is because of christ i dont think of anything that i do as being something that ive done on my own
5814693 im thankful that god has allowed me to have that success
5814694 i think im going to have to get the surgery
5814695 i just cannot go on training like i am now its too painful
5814696 but they who wait for the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint
5814697 that would kind of epitomize what i was going through that day
5814698 i felt like he just carried me through that day i didnt have any pain at all for that last trials race and i think a lot of that is god taking it away
5814699 but im capable of getting on the podium thats a goal that i have for myself to get on the podium
5814700 i won my very first race i think there were only three other 10 year olds in the race there werent many other kids out there but i didnt care
5814701 pretty much the best triathletes in the world usually are some of the best runners in the world as well
5814702 because running is the last leg and you get off the bike with other athletes you have to outrun them in order to win the race
5814703 as athletes when you compete you can fall under this false sense of security that youre the one getting these medals
5814704 were the ones that are doing this on our own strength
5814705 i hope that i can perform up to my abilities and that the lord gives me strength that day
5814706 whether its a good race or whether its a bad race im going to give him all the credit
5814707 it was a little nerve racking because i was coming out of college and i went there thinking i was going to make the team
5814708 i got fourth place and i was really crushed but then i thought to myself god obviously did this to me for a reason just telling me maybe i need to work a little harder it was just the other girls time
5814709 of course i was telling myself i wish i got last but then i looked at the grand scheme of things and thought obviously god does things for a reason and im going to have my time
5814710 but i just accepted it and i think thats why hes brought me back here again i totally believe that this year should be my year
5814711 i dont think he would have given me this talent for no reason at all i feel like i need to use this talent and i dream about it all the time
5814712 im like why am i dreaming about this this must be something god wants me to do i dont give up very easily
5814713 obviously he keeps bringing it back to me and i keep getting blessed with track and field and the doors keep opening up i had to switch coaches and i ended up running into an awesome coach and where im training now its really good and i can focus i think god just keeps the door open for me
5814714 im not going to put anybody on the back burner
5814715 im excited i planned on getting on the medal stand
5814716 in the heptathlon sometimes you have to take the good with the bad and i had a lot of that this week
5814717 i tried to give it my all i told my coach if i didnt fall over the finish line then i wasnt doing any work
5814718 i always think of i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
5814719 thats my way of thanking god for giving me this opportunity
5814720 i decided i needed to make a change and i turned to god
5814721 bryan credits two things with getting his life back on track his success in sports that led him to college and his belief and acceptance of the christian faith
5814722 at azusa pacific university in southern california bryan really began to accept the christian faith that his mother had been trying to instill in him for many years
5814723 no longer a troubled teen he is now a devoted christian that has an incomparable work ethic a commitment to excellence and an unwavering integrity
5814724 a huge reason why i havent been tempted to take drugs or do anything of that sort is because i realize that winning is not my life its not my identity
5814725 i know that god has me doing what im doing i know that yes i can win i also know that im not going to win all the time and i know that either way win or lose that god is going to provide for me
5814726 i realized that christ has the ability to make the impossible possible in my life
5814727 i believe now that i can do the things that he has placed in my path while looking to him for strength
5814728 the outcome of my season is out of my direct control but as long as i stay disciplined i know that i can
5814729 if it is gods will i will accomplish my goal of winning an olympic medal
5814730 because god gives me my worth and i cant earn it through rowing i feel i am less prone to go through the ups and downs associated with my performance
5814731 god is my biggest fan he will always love me no matter how i do and he has the toughest expectations perfection so im always trying to improve
5814732 my father said we were all going to die he said that he wanted the whole family to pray and prepare to go to heaven
5814733 my family started to pray but i went outside and hid in the garden i heard the rebels knock on the door it opened they said something to my family i understood that it was over it was death
5814734 a few years later i was asking myself why my family who had prayed was all now dead where are they now
5814735 but i had confidence that my family and friends who perished were in heaven i realized that if i was ever going to see my family again i needed to start praying again the way to see my family again was through prayer
5814736 in the bible it says that there is only one way to heaven jesus christ
5814737 if you are to get to heaven it can only be through jesus christ for me jesus christ is the way to heaven and the only way to god
5814738 my faith is definitely the most important aspect of my life
5814739 my dad is a pastor and i grew up in a very strong christian home our family was very involved in our church
5814740 i came to know jesus christ as my personal savior at a very young age ever since then i have continually been striving to grow in my relationship with god
5814741 i was nowhere close to the perfect child i had my share of difficult times along with some disappointing choices that i made but thankfully god never stopped loving me
5814742 im currently a work in progress and like anyone else i face struggles every day
5814743 my goal is to be more christ like each and every day and that is not an easy take
5814744 in the season of my life that i am in now i feel so blessed that god has given me the talent of running
5814745 my running is an amazing gift from god and i want to use it to the best of my ability to glorify him im thankful that i have been given this platform so that i can share my faith with the world
5814746 that verse always encourages my heart when i am dealing with any kind of pressure and throughout the struggles of life my faith calms my heart
5814747 i try to stay in the bible and i pray a lot just talking to god he provides my strength and wisdom
5814748 i know my talent is from god and thats my purpose to run to glorify him

5814780 i have begun a task to rebuild afghanistan into a peaceful prosperous country into a democratic country a country where the afghan people will have a voice and their rights respected a country that will be producing on its own and living off its own means
5814781 i have achieved some of those objectives i have not achieved some of the other objectives
5814782 afghanistan is not at peace the afghan people still suffer massively in the war against terrorism and in the war for stability in afghanistan afghanistan is not yet a well off country still a very poor country

5814811 ive still got a rather lengthy amount of time before i decide anything
5814812 as a collective we have been so poor in that arena
5814813 and this was a team that was supposed to be built on offense more than anything else weve been offensively challenged
5814814 we still have hopes we still have dreams weve put too much work in to just have it die right now
5814815 you know what its like when you have children and you say get the car home at a certain time or be home before a certain time and they dont theres a certain amount of anger at first but then a lot of its based on disappointment
5814816 thats a mental mistake he made right there its not a lack of effort
5814817 its one of those situations where he assumed weve talked about assumptions thats an assumption on his part thats part of his game weve got to get rid of
5814818 i think everybody in here will do everything possible to make sure it doesnt happen again its not in joes hands any more its in nobodys hands but ours
5814819 it bothers me you get choked up a little bit because its like man weve got something real special here we dont need to be talking about this stuff
5814820 usually there comes a time where you get some guys some playing time sean got a lot of playing time at second base earlier this year theres no doubt about the way he handles himself on the field and that will translate to shortstop too

5814822 our son was coming home and telling us the school was trying to kill him with his communication deficits at the time he didnt know how to say he was being restrained
5814823 i remember they just grabbed me and put me into the room or whatever and i remember they had the mat and just threw me to the ground
5814824 every time they restrained my son they were stepping outside of their training
5814825 restraint is the emergency procedure its the back up its the thing you may have to do if all else fails and theres a risk to the individual or others
5814826 crucial in this whole thing are the denied services allegany limestone central schools i believe intentionally mis classified my son for six years
5814827 if a kid is achieving academically im not sure what their responsibility is after that wed all like them to embrace and do more but their resources are limited as well
5814828 i dont think school districts have ever seen this with the frequency that theyre starting to see it now because theyre keeping kids with more challenging behaviors within the context

5814836 ive been involved in coastal research and coastal management in tasmania now for 30 years working both on shore birds and sea birds and in the 30 years that ive been involved in ive seen at a state level average a loss of 50 per cent of the numbers of birds and the mix of birds
5814837 there are birds that i remember seeing in the 80s that i havent seen now for 20 years
5814838 if you own a farm property or business or a normal householder and suffer adverse effects from gunns pulp mill youve got no common law claim
5814839 what you know about numbers it isnt just encoded in your language its much more than that
5814840 in our view there are some very basic number competencies that are encoded in the genome in some way
5814841 these include 4tab racing service at charters towers at translator for a community service at bowen thats actually currently not on the air and a narrowcast dance music station in townsville

5814849 thirty years ago something like 60 per cent of adult males smoked now that figure is below 20 per cent so we have seen a significant change over thirty years
5814850 the big picture is that there are several dimensions in which games have effects
5814851 this means that games are not good or bad but are powerful educational tools and have many effects we might not have expected they could
5814852 its goal is to bring together as much information as possible and to make it accessible to researchers of all kinds and members of the public
5814853 so that it becomes a lot easier to answer questions about what really is in this country what its doing what its chances are under climate change and other threats and to really help us all to manage our environment somewhat better
5814854 its a job to bring together information from the natural history collections from field workers of various kinds and from members of the public to place their observations into a context that can be used for modelling and understanding a bit more about the real requirements of each of those species
5814855 weve only named probably about 10 to 20 per cent of australian insects
5814856 so most insects we dont know yet and the ones we do know we only have a limited amount of information
5814857 so really we have no idea about their distribution or where they are likely to live or what their biology is
5814858 what that means is we dont have the information we need that might help conserve them
5814859 strict data basing it would take about a thousand person years
5814860 but there is a lot of work that has to go into the collection first in terms of updating the curation to make it available
5814861 so what we really need to do is thinking about ways of automating the entire process to expedite things
5814862 one of the earliest things well be offering is at least the beginnings of a system which allows users to enter the name of a species and find a summary view of what we know about their distribution from those data sets that are already connected
5814863 probably thumbnail images and links to literature resources and web pages that we know of for those species
5814864 they are going to be some of the early results from this
5814865 the longer terms goals are probably actually for the atlas to be much more invisible and for it to be providing some of the kind of tools that plug into other websites that are bringing information to the public
5814866 the purpose of the atlas isnt simply to exist in its own right as a final place for information but to take it to the places where it can be used and made most beneficial
5814867 were dealing with a problem which is inside a municipality where we probably need to apply controls which are normally more pastoral protection board events

5814871 some children find it difficult to sit still for longer periods of time as they are now required to with academic learning in the early years or school
5814872 we dont know for example that some children may have had a late night or maybe are having a lot of late nights or theyre not getting breakfast or things that are going on in the home
5814873 or there are other things like children might have expressive and receptive language difficulties
5814874 in many cases its not i think one thing that needs to be made really clear is that adhd is a label it is a label that someone in the medical fraternity has come up with to group and describe a particular group of children and i dont think its the best one
5814875 oh absolutely but weve been asked to address issues of adhd so we are looking at the issues around adhd
5814876 yes teachers should be supported in dealing with all sorts of disability in the classroom it would be of concern if other classrooms difficulties and disabilities were ignored things like specific learning difficulties have been raised and then there are the issues sensory deficits vision and hearing and things like that that teachers can often draw attention to
5814877 we found that the workers were significantly above the male suicide rate for queensland in the active population
5814878 the male suicide rate in the active population is 17 74 per 100 000 compared to 36 58 for the agricultural male workers
5814879 one of the biggest things in the past has been the fear that probably media has sensationalised some of the statistics that have been quoted
5814880 but this is the first time that weve actually looked really closely and reliably at a very fixed working population which hasnt been done before and have identified that yes they are at quite significantly higher risk
5814881 i guess it lays the foundations for really needing to investigate more thoroughly what are the very specific risk factors for agriculture workers
5814882 it puts huge pressure on farm families it provides both financial and emotional impacts for a farming family and hence does contribute towards suicide rates
5814883 farmers and farm workers live in a very isolated position they are both physically and socially isolated from others so if their thinking is getting shifted and they are under this stress or they are suffering any mental health condition its not so readily picked up by others
5814884 then clearly theyve got the location that makes it easier perhaps for them to go through and commit suicide without being noticed and under the scrutiny of other people
5814885 for its 20th anniversary chowderfest 2008 will be more spectacular than ever and overflowing with fun and excitement you can say that people will be clam oring to go

5815037 everyone thinks samantha is lindsays first lesbian love but we were very passionate until her fear of being found out drove us apart
5815038 but then samantha came on to the scene and i was dropped
5815039 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up

5815058 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs
5815059 i doubt it two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was aa she was into peace for a while whatever is of the moment thats lindsay
5815060 but the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam she could be any religion and lindsay would be open to it
5815061 it is a great joy to welcome into our midst one who willingly and devotedly helps replenish the ranks of my people
5815062 my response simply was did you really just ask me hat she is a 14 year old girl and you are a pedophile
5815063 i was raised with a wonderful family surrounding me of course we have our ups and downs but all in all my mother taught us to appreciate what we have been given nor would she ever encourage or allow a 14 year old child to alter her body
5815064 i am not judging people that do but i am just saying that its not something that my family finds necessary to do especially when youre not even fully developed yet
5815065 it is hard enough being 14 years old and you have enough insecurities to begin with then add being in the public eye
5815066 i just find it really disconcerting that people have to focus on the negative and that some people are sooooo bored with their own lives that they need to manifest lies to hurt another person
5815067 tell him hes fucking amazing and i want to meet him

5815097 how do they get away with it i thought it was supposed to be out in the open
5815098 they are issues we will submit to the reform commission for a recommendation and a response i dont want to pre judge its a policy issue they should look at

5815103 we dont know anything other than what were reading in the paper
5815104 to hide the fact that these campaign e mails were being sent from the taxpayer owned caucus computer system in the capitol
5815105 to disguise the fact that these were actually a product of taxpayer resources
5815106 if you put all these allegations together what we are seeing is a theft of democracy and taxpayers are picking up the tab
5815107 its like the public unknowingly turn over their credit card to politicos and are being beaten with it

5815111 murtha has a lot of issues on his hands in terms of keeping his seat this november there are chinks in the armor
5815112 we were afraid it wasnt going to get done right and i didnt want to push it through fast we wanted to do it 100 percent right
5815113 i specifically put this on the agenda right after the april 22 election to make sure it got done
5815114 the rolls need to be as accurate as possible especially with this type of election and with the larger turnout that were going to have
5815115 i really anticipated the election bureau to be prepared to do the purge by now
5815116 it is more than simply mailing out letters it also involves processing the returns and mailings and inputting the updates to the system this is all coupled with preparing for the nov 4 election which is expected to have a high turnout
5815117 designed to assure the accuracy and integrity of the commonwealths voter registration records maintained by the election authorities of pennsylvanias 67 counties
5815118 we need to have an internal procedure to receive the returned mailings and input the data into the sure system in a timely manner so that the poll books and system were up to date so that after the two general election periods have passed the system removes the names
5815119 if this isnt set up and followed using the sure system then the entire purge process could be compromised
5815120 id rather do it right than do it in a hurry and wrong but im disappointed

5815126 i dont hold her responsible i think she made a good decision
5815127 it wasnt feasible for me to get it done and postmarked and out of here by the 6th
5815128 i couldnt be guaranteed i would have all of my supplies in here and out on time printed folded presorted and stuffed
5815129 an adult someone who is taking 100 percent responsibility for what he or she brings to relationship recognizes that agreement keeping is a choice plan and simple
5815130 she had a moment of real happiness then a moment of belief that if there were sacrifice in this love it was all the richer and more satisfying
5815131 o it is difficult life is very difficult it seems right to me sometimes that we should follow our strongest feeling but then such feelings continually come across the ties that all our former life has made for us the ties that have made others dependent on us and would cut them in two if life were quite easy and simple as it might have been in paradise and we could always see that one being first towards whom i mean if life did not make duties for us before love comes love would be a sign that two people ought to belong to each other but i see i feel it is not so now there are things we must renounce in life some of us must resign love many things are difficult and dark to me but i see one thing quite clearly that i must not cannot seek my own happiness by sacrificing others love is natural but surely pity and faithfulness and memory are natural too and they would live in me still and punish me if i did not obey them i should be haunted by the suffering i had caused our love would be poisoned dont urge me help me help me because i love you

5815157 ive also directed secretary of defence bob gates to begin a humanitarian mission to the people of georgia headed by the united states military this mission will be vigorous and ongoing
5815158 one of the broader issues at stake is the great game for central asia for influence in the southern rimlands of russia for control of the flow of oil and gas from the caspian thats a long term agenda but the us wants to be in the region and wants georgia and other countries to be looking west so its not suprising that the us wants to get back into tblisi
5815159 given the constellation of power given the fact that this state is being singled out by the russians primarily because it is a pro western state primarily because it has sought nato membership largely for the purposes of demonstrating that nato shouldnt be allowed to expand where russia chooses not to have it expand makes the stakes tremendously high and i dont think the administrations actions thus far have been remotely decisive enough for the magnitude of the challenge to the international order this poses
5815160 i had to give him the benefit of the doubt because he has some good qualities he always ate everything i ever cooked for him
5815161 is she really princess not so bright or is she just pretending
5815162 wink wink nudge nudge arent i cute when i push the boundaries
5815163 dumb as a box of hammers but hes such a handsome guy
5815164 if there is a recession in an economy it will kill inflation even if inflation seems like it is spiraling out of control a recession will kill it because you are destroying the demand in an economy that is there to push prices up
5815165 we are starting to see energy prices and other commodities coming off their highs i dont think that that is noise it is probably a cyclical move meaning that it will probably persist for a few quarters it will be pronounced enough that we are all going to notice and it will be pervasive it wont be one or two commodities it will be a broad range
5815166 the risk of this process going off the rails is quite significant and if there is a significant delay in disablement it will mean that the third and the crucial phase of this process dismantlement of north koreas capabilities will be deferred even more and unlikely even to be discussed in the remainder of the bush administration
5815167 shell go to refugee camps shell meet with dissidents shell meet with ethnic minority ngos the karen and the shan and others shell meet with the aid workers president bush will get a briefing on the cyclone he will probably i expect meet with some burmese exile leaders in bangkok
5815168 he is right not to diss 1 3 billion chinese by skipping it but he also recognizes that theres an expectation that he will carry the flag on human rights and on these issues
5815169 are you nervous to be on the radio because i am
5815170 they think to themselves wow they have the most expensive coffee in the world one of the rarest coffees in the world
5815171 in the little guys stomach a fermentation process happens which actually enhances the flavor of the bean
5815172 it didnt really phase me and im willing to try new things and im glad i did because its worth it
5815173 thirty dollars a cup its a bit steep and i probably wouldnt pay thirty dollars for a cup of coffee
5815174 today i was told that it is a priority at the studio to find the right direction and if bryan singer is willing to do that fine but if he gets in the way he may not stay on the project
5815175 western engineers product ideas are shaped by laws of abundance whereas eastern engineers inventions are motivated by the rules of scarcity

5815177 this outstanding vehicle is not a replica or movie promotional vehicle but rather the actual 3 of 5 batmobiles actually used in the batman returns movie other less valuable non movie promotional batmobiles have sold for as much as 550 000 00
5815178 this authentic movie masterpiece is expected to bring a record price
5815179 our lives no matter how battered and degraded will yield hope to share with others
5815180 estaria bueno q pongan la inflacion q tenia alfonsin a los 6 meses de su gobierno
5815181 creo que abraham gak va a estar de acuerdo conmigo en esto
5815182 por lo tanto los aumentos en la cantidad de dinero no fueron una causa de la inflaci n sino la consecuencia l gica de ese tipo de cambio
5815183 the u s spends twice per capita what other major industrialized countries spend on health care and costs continue to rise faster than income
5815184 we are headed toward 1 of every 5 of national income going toward health care we should expect a better return on this investment
5815185 overall national scores declined for 41 of indicators while one third 35 improved and the rest exhibited no change or were not updated
5815186 focus more on what we share and less on where we differ
5815187 the more you try to please members of every single group the greater danger you are of deeply offending someone left out
5815188 the respectful way to hold a banquet is to offer vegetarian and nonvegetarian choices
5815189 try historical music the big bands and sounds of the 40s its less of a hot button than if you play rap and have no christmas carols
5815190 one mistake companies make is inviting people for evening celebrations and not including the entire family
5815191 get everyone together in a room to be light and buoyant and to celebrate without using any individual religious or cultural symbols
5815192 holiday time diversity used to mean just adding a hanukkah menorah to the decorations
5815193 employers must be sensitive to the religious beliefs of their employees and create more flexible celebrations to include all of them
5815194 even where schools have lots of new books the kinds of stories seem rather similar we need all kinds of diversity in childrens books we need to look at class and disability as well as culture thats how children learn empathy
5815195 thank you for making me understand a little more about myself
5815196 children are interested and engaged in worlds beyond their own the publishers are concentrating on what they know will sell but why shouldnt more of this kind of story sell
5815197 a chance for teachers among others to tell publishers what is needed there has been a great shift in the knowledge and awareness available since the 1970s when childrens publishing was a very pristine little world it is time to pool that knowledge
5815198 what can the book trade do to sensibly sensitively and profitably access this book market
5815199 dont want to feel boxed in on content they want to be allowed to experiment
5815200 its a matter of making it clear that youre open and interested and it might mean looking at new sources of writers the generation we are publishing for is very culturally integrated yet the success of black and asian writers for adults is not happening in childrens publishing
5815201 when we see something good from a non white writer we jump at it if it is of the same quality as the rest of our list or we know we can work successfully with the writer to improve it ninety nine per cent of what we publish comes from agents i suspect there are new black writers who have not considered writing for children because there are not many role models and we are going to have to think of ways to find them
5815202 a will to change things its a chance to raise the debate in a positive spirit and i hope it will encourage people from ethnically diverse backgrounds to get into every aspect of publishing writing the books making them and selling them its very white and middle class at the moment its also important that the publisher cares about the book rather than feeling that they are ticking a multicultural box thats what i looked for in my early days
5815203 former competitor employees can share insights related to the competitions performance operations culture management strategic direction and other valuable topics as long as they are not betraying a trust held between them and their former employer
5815204 in short they represent a valuable unique exclusive and easily accessible font of competitor knowledge
5815205 it is difficult to help when you dont know if youre being understood
5815206 did you know that the first civil rights law was passed right after the civil war more than 130 years ago
5815207 many gays and lesbians prefer the term sexual orientation over sexual preference as it expresses their sense that ones sexuality is not a choice but is how someone is born
5815208 i feel diminished when im referred to as a gal or girl
5815209 lets focus on creating an approach that we can both agree on
5815210 jokes about other religions or cultural groups are off limits with me
5815211 organizations should do all they can to ensure theres a numerically based decision on diversity goals
5815212 you can look at census data as an indicator of the makeup of your labor pool
5815213 when the hiring company moves up into managerial and executive ranks often the recruiting area gets larger
5815214 the search may go from city and county to statewide or nationwide
5815215 companies shouldnt assume an executive wont move to des moines because theyre african american
5815216 most of the major public health issues today disproportionately affect minorities
5815217 who could better understand their plight than someone from their racial ethnic group we want to speak to people who understand us culturally and face some of the same challenges we do
5815218 when mastering activities of daily living like meal preparation bathing etc you need to have an appreciation of the values and beliefs of a population
5815219 we are involved with promoting cultural diversity in workshops at schools in our web page and during recruitment and speakers bureaus
5815220 we market people of color we want to show that our membership is diverse we want advocates and speakers of all races to represent our organization
5815221 the apta is proud of their accomplishments which not only promote cultural competency to its professionals but also attempts to recruit a diverse enrollment at the local level
5815222 the lack of visibility of dietetics to young minority people and the academic disadvantaged is one of the principle reasons for underrepresentation of minorities
5815223 when our profession started in world war i it was primarily white middle class women who wanted to help soldiers this captured the hearts of women at the time services were provided in private hospitals in a confined community
5815224 this isnt an issue of color it has to do with socioeconomic class the minority students who attend college are from affluent backgrounds the black child from beverly hills doesnt share the same experience as the white person in harlem
5815225 there is a hefty cost associated with entering an allied health field its much cheaper to become a computer programmer
5815226 it refers to the composition of people associated with the organization inclusion on the other hand describes the way an organization configures opportunity interaction communication information and decision making to utilize the potential of diversity
5815227 focus on including everyone and excluding no one they are qualitative eeo aa policies however focus on the quantitative counting how many members of the protected classes are hired and promoted based on legislation
5815228 we are not a homogenous society we have many differences that we must be responsive to age gender race ethnicity sexual orientation religion socio economic status educational levels etc call centers have the opportunity to embrace diversity both internally and externally those that do are better equipped to meet and exceed their employees and clients needs
5815229 champion diversity by infusing it into all organizational processes and ensuring that diversity is integrated into the core values of the organization
5815230 flavor of the month versus a corporate culture ongoing revolution
5815231 not just a nice thing to do but the profitable thing to do you need to present the business case behind the effort
5815232 the real reason for a diversity initiative succeeding is that you treat it like any other strategy
5815233 you have to make sure the ceo and top management are supportive of it
5815234 todays leaders realize that in order to be effective successful diversity planning must be aligned with and provide support for strategic business objectives and operational decisions
5815235 a number of our benchmarking partners pointed out that one could not develop a successful diversity process without periodically assessing and evaluating the status and accomplishments of the process
5815236 you want to be measuring the right thing it is very disheartening when youve got a set of metrics that dont really get to the heart of where you want to go
5815237 treating employees and clients as they want to be treated is very different than the golden rule of treating them as you want to be treated you may insult or demean or not exceed their expectations in order to treat them as they want to be treated you must be willing to get to know their differences
5815238 diversity is effort but well worth it when difference intrigues us enough to want to know more about one another because difference is viewed as an asset versus a liability imagine the collaborative possibilities
5815239 taking all the factors into consideration the decision has been taken that there is insufficient evidence to afford a realistic prospect of conviction and accordingly the police have been advised that no further action should be taken against mr bale
5815240 whilst the cps treats all incidents which take place in a domestic context seriously it is important that the views of complainants are also taken into account when making decisions in such cases
5815241 whats good for the goose is good for the gander
5815242 ich kapiere nicht warum lang ping nicht unsere chinesen trainiert macht ihr das spa unsere frauen von den usa schlagen zu wollen
5815243 lassen sich unsere athleten etwa nicht von 28 ausl ndischen trainern helfen hat unser goldfechter zhongman seinen erfolg nicht auch dem els sser coach christian bauer zu verdanken
5815244 dass die ausl nder lang ping als ihre trainerin wollen
5815245 dein herz ist nicht gr er als ein go stein
5815246 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
5815247 protecting data is more important than ever given the mounting security risks associated with todays mobile workforce and compliance mandates at all times we need to know that no confidential data leaves the premises that should not and no malware infects our network via virus laden device or rogue application
5815248 lumension securitys endpoint protection and data protection suite allows us to be proactive yet flexible with the data encryption and enforcement of policies around employee device and application use whats more this powerful solution extends our control over cd and dvd data by allowing us to reduce risk of data loss and theft by encrypting and protecting easily accessible information while enabling end user productivity
5815249 the growing proliferation of inexpensive portable media and storage devices are leaving organizations more exposed to data loss and theft
5815250 this type of loss can cost businesses millions of dollars in lost business and customer loyalty not to mention legal issues in order to help enterprises shore up their defenses against data leakage the sanctuary suite prevents data loss and leakage through unauthorized removable devices this new suite is designed to enable business productivity and ensure high levels of security by allowing organizations to establish policies that restrict unauthorized executables and control access and use of usb cd dvd and other storage devices
5815251 shiseido ensures highest level of business security and continuity with lumension security
5815252 before establishing polices and implementing lumensions solution to enforce them we were constantly chasing fires that were spreading across all four of our u s sites nearly every day we were dealing with a different worm or virus that made its way onto our network most of which were the result of un patched vulnerabilities in our operating systems
5815253 with lumensions solutions were able to quickly proactively assess and eliminate all known vulnerabilities and contain any malware through the cost savings on it staff resources alone we were able to achieve roi in just three months
5815254 because we are a japanese company with a global presence compliance is a major issue lumensions vulnerability management suite helps us meet the japanese version of sarbanes oxley as well as various other requirements by developing clear policies and procedures for our patch and vulnerability management processes we are also able to track software licenses dynamically something that is very important when signing contracts with microsoft and ibm
5815255 additionally we are able to react to issues more quickly which is as important as any quantifiable roi figures lumensions vulnerability management suite gives us a more security centric view of the network allowing us to gain greater insight into the network and a better overall view into the system we are able to more rapidly adjust to changes in the business making our it operation much more proactive and flexible and therefore more productive
5815256 i was nervous about not being able to fit in because of my cultural values and the color of my skin
5815257 to foster dialogues about issues of race and about where race and gender meet in the workplace
5815258 my company is sensitive to the cultural issues facing women of color in the organization
5815259 do you currently have an ongoing mentor at your place of work
5815260 its not the same as sitting down with your mom or a close friend
5815261 it didnt dawn on me until i got a call from a headhunter who offered three times my salary that i was being so underpaid
5815262 its a great time to be a woman of color in corporate america
5815263 but there is still a lot of work to be done to get rid of the stereotypes and focus on our skills and abilities
5815264 compraron la nota lo que hacen es traspasarla a una cuenta de valores en el exterior lo que existe en venezuela es control de cambios pero no controles sobre los activos financieros con lo cual nada ilegal est sucediendo

5815278 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment
5815279 additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
5815280 the release date change does not alter the production schedule for this or future harry potter films post production on half blood prince was completed on time and the studios release plans for the two part harry potter and the deathly hallows will not be affected by this change we know harry potter fans are eagerly anticipating seeing the final chapters unfold onscreen in fact the good news for them is that the gap will now be shortened between half blood prince and the first part of harry potter and the deathly hallows
5815281 it has been a joy to work on harry potter and the half blood prince dan rupert and emma and all our returning young cast continue to blossom and our new cast members bring fresh color and life to hogwarts even as we put the finishing touches on this latest film we are already beginning preparations on the final two films we start filming in february and i am excited to bring this remarkable series to the exciting and moving conclusion its loyal fans deserve
5815282 a film is a very specific and personal account of bill carters experience in sarajevo during the war and we would very much like to make the film here
5815283 this is a departure from the very big hollywood productions
5815284 im not in fact playing bill in this movie but i read the script and the very human story at the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
5815285 if he said hes iron man in the first film its one thing to say it and another thing to evolve to a point where you can live in a heroic fashion
5815286 our goal is also more of the same in iron man 2 we want to do what worked for us last time im talking about telling more of the story of a guy put in extraordinary circumstances who has a family now and hes dealing with these forces
5815287 in iron man 2 you will be able to understand various points of view about him that are far reaching while this guy is still grounded in reality
5815288 it will be director guy ritchies take on sherlock holmes
5815289 its a contemporary version of a classic tale but were not telling one of the stories from the books
5815290 the cool thing about sherlock is hes a very skilled martial artist
5815291 so its not just about is deductions this movie will also be a very action packed version of sherlock holmes
5815292 its real balls to the walls brutal stuff guy is a martial artist and im a martial arts student so youll get all the sherlock stuff but hopefully much more fun
5815293 we all want this movie to go into production as soon as possible
5815294 its a fast tracked movie lionsgate felt the process was enhanced by having a second team come in and do a script
5815295 fans expect these types of movies to be more true to the source material
5815296 theres no reason there couldnt be a conan movie every two years hes almost like batman hes a dark hero hes a hard hero he has to be badass but we also have to like him
5815297 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight
5815298 didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5815299 you know youre never too old to burn your bridges because i believe i have offended everyone
5815300 i think ive got a couple more ill burn that bridge when i come to it is my favourite phrase ive ever coined

5815320 oh i knew there was not point in showing up at 3 no one would be there yet
5815321 our lives no matter how battered and degraded will yield hope to share with others
5815322 id have to ask him for d i and a
5815323 have you met billg wheres billg when can i see billg
5815324 omg my sister s are like so pretty and grown up now
5815325 when youre trying to lose its actually the decrease in calories thats more effective
5815326 this is not much to go by to give a cementation
5815327 even god will be a silent spectator as he will be helpless
5815328 dont think about it dont think about it dont think about it
5815329 so i opened the envelope skeptically to see what was inside
5815330 now they got my attention i was so excited that i got a new phone so i turned to my parents to tell them that this was not a scam but for real at this point i was thinking they must have given me some cheap phone
5815331 and as a sign of my sincerity i would give you a small
5815332 there was no sense of love or gratitude but it was a business transaction
5815333 is never in the vocabulary when we worship these many gods or wandering spirits
5815334 hello warriors ive come a long way to get here dont the darkspears respect hospitality
5815335 for sure but what are you some corpse that jumped up out of its grave
5815336 cha you go on in then but remember this we are far away from orgrimmar here in zabrajin you live by our rules and our rules alone tread carefully if you want to stay undead
5815337 i always take care to respect the wishes of my host
5815338 dead human if you know whats good for you you wont be going up to the second floor shadow hunter denjai is there and he wont want to see you unless you have reason to be there do you hear me
5815339 i saw you come in to the village some of us would like to see you if you would follow me
5815340 the politics here in zabrajin are none too friendly i fear theyre happy to receive orcs and tauren but denjai hates the forsaken and the blood elves
5815341 im happy to see youve kept your senses at least
5815342 thats what they taught me to do back in darkbriar
5815343 not everyone here is happy with denjai no one planned it this way but most of denjais friends live on the ground while those who dont like him so much live up here they call us mushroom trolls because our heads are soft like mushroom caps
5815344 tell me destron what do the orcs say about us in honor hold
5815345 general nazgrel said that zabrajin was to be built on the northern bank of the lagoon many miles to the east but denjai he say that the spirits guided him here who are we to argue with a shadow hunter
5815346 hes got his hand in other problems right now to make things right with old nazgrel wily denjai sent some people to built a base far to the east swamprat post its called everyone there is a mushroom troll glad to have put zabrajin behind them
5815347 do you think denjai had an ulterior motive for building zabrajin so deep in the west or did the spirits really tell him to do it
5815348 shadow hunters can better hear the spirits of the dead than can we shamans those were the ones denjai heard i deal with the swamp spirits and they dont much care where we live denjai has his own plans and he makes no secret of them
5815349 a new homeland for the trolls with zabrajin as its heart denjai is a brave troll driven by mad passions he studied under old rokhan himself denjai respects the orcs but he fears that his people will become like the orcs you ever been to senjin village
5815350 after the darkspear were thrown out of the echo isles some wanted to stay in durotar others to go back denjai thought we should return to the islands no reason to live so close to the orcs but the sages spoke and decided to remain in durotar
5815351 do you support this effort of a troll homeland in zangarmarsh
5815352 to live here yes i am for that but we should not distance ourselves from our friends
5815353 after denjai learned all he could from master rokhan he sailed the seas back to stranglethorn this was when the war drums beat fierce in the jungle night and the holy men of zandalar said no more to the soulflayers bloody priests
5815354 denjai made himself a grand terror to the tribes there that much is for certain and as they feared him some grew to love him when denjai returned to durotar he brought seventeen fierce hunters with him bloodscalp skullsplitter and even a few blaspheming gurubashi they followed his banner
5815355 two died in hellfire four more have died here the rest live the darkspear werent much respected by the other tribes but so great was denjai that they forgot their scorn
5815356 the raptor fangs theyre uh warriors the raptor fangs arent officially part of the horde defenses here they go out to the twin spire ruins hunting around for alliance mercenaries
5815357 the raptor fangs are led by denjais personal bodyguards you know bloodscalps and the like very fierce warriors and some have powers of the spirit never ever cross them
5815358 destron master denjai says he wants you in the village this is for all the horde to see
5815359 no one really knows where the bonechewers came from most figure they couldnt survive in nagrand too many other clans there anyway they somehow ended up in the swamp not a good place for an orc as im sure you know
5815360 they would have the same problem as zabrajin not enough meat
5815361 and that right there is why they became cannibals the bonechewers raided northern nagrand striking quick as lightning their warriors would pillage and then run back to the swamp carrying captive and cattle to the cookpot bonechewers even ah chewed the bones of their own dead nothing insulting in it to them
5815362 i dont know for sure but i doubt it the bonechewer warriors could only win by making ambushes they were poor warriors when it came to drawn out fights maybe they werent strong enough
5815363 why did the horde accept the bonechewers it seems like the other clans would hate them
5815364 that they did but i guess guldan had his own uses for them the orcs sent the bonechewers up north they killed ogres for a while with the help of the thunderlords
5815365 they werent much use when nerzhul became warchief he forced the bonechewers the entire clan to move south to shadowmoon pass there they stayed until he finally got rid of them
5815366 that it does swamps can do strange things to the mind too you start seeing a monster behind every tree every mushroom in this case
5815367 do you think the swamp has an affect on denjai
5815368 ah come on now denjais not going to be driven mad by some old swamp trust me he knows what hes doing
5815369 my name is irianne hallisworth youll pardon my suspicion these are dangerous times and nowhere is that more true than in outland the sporelings are beset by enemies on every side the last thing they need are those damned poisoners
5815370 good i will admit that your reasons for coming surprise me precious few forsaken have any interest in the sporelings
5815371 i have interest in many things i take it that youve befriended these people
5815372 to an extent the sporelings are sorely in need of friends they do not hate me for being undead in fact im not at all sure they even comprehend our state
5815373 msshifn the sporeggar primus enabled me to do so i imagine shell do the same for you
5815374 shes more of a village elder or record keeper than a leader per se ill be frank mr allicant to communicate with the sporelings you must let them implant spores into your head its quite harmless
5815375 its simple you just need to put it in your ears the resulting fungus allows one to understand the sporelings speech
5815376 excuse me id like to request an audience with the primus i have someone who may be of aid to the village
5815377 very good the spores should finish growing tomorrow then youll be able to understand the sporelings thank you primus msshifn
5815378 mere happenstance mr allicant those savages at zabrajin mentioned it and i believed it warranted investigation i think ive made a good impression on them on behalf of myself and for the horde i really am mortified by the uncouth behavior of the horde races were damned lucky that alliance adventurers arent any better in that regard the tauren are the only horde race that i would trust with the sporelings but there are few of them in outland
5815379 yes and ive informed them of my concerns it will be some time before theres any official backing of the sporeling people the tribes may not even have enough braves to truly protect my new friends here
5815380 the translator fungus is truly one of our greatest creations
5815381 i am no need to worry i understand that we all look the same to you you said you wanted to learn about the sporeling people would now be a good time to start
5815382 our diet is as it has always been rotting mushrooms and fish ingestion creates the phosphorescence on our bodies the color changing according to the composition of the meal
5815383 starvation is one problem we never need to face so where shall we begin
5815384 id like to know the history of the sporeling people
5815385 its a good deal more extensive than just sporeggar our legends speak of a race called the shapers who raised the world from primordial muck they charged us sporelings with maintaining the mushroom jungles
5815386 not to our knowledge but zangarmarsh was twice its current size back when the world was still whole our first colony was called sporekish and it grew far in the west where the ocean met the land
5815387 did you just send me an image of sporekish mentally that is
5815388 its a side effect of the translator certain terms spark images the one you saw was given to me by the primus of sporenai who received it from its own predecessors in that way we remember the past
5815389 sadly no that happened before sporekish before we truly learned to think
5815390 very slowly over the course of millennia we sporelings live in perfect balance with the swamp we only grow new sporelings to replace those who have fallen the race was content to stay in sporekish but the beasts of the swamp became a menace to defend ourselves we grew more sporelings than ever before a single sporeling has very little strength unlike orcs or draenei we lack muscles and bones numbers are our only hope anyway after surmounting such challenges these excess sporelings needed a place to live we continued to grow in this way and we eventually controlled twenty two colonies throughout zangarmarsh we even established a few in the blood tropic a deadly swamp north of the blades edge
5815391 sporeggar is the last real colony we tried to make a few more after the fall of the wrekt sending one south and another far to the east the first was destroyed by draenic mutants and the second is besieged
5815392 we are trying to grow new sporelings for that purpose but it is difficult sporeggar itself is barely surviving
5815393 a draenic ambassador once visited sporekish a little over a hundred years before the breaking the sporelings liked her but she had to return to shattrath for some reason and no replacement was ever sent
5815394 irianne tells me that the orcs here called themselves the bonechewer clan they were our enemies but it was rare for us to actually fight
5815395 the bonechewer clan had a reputation for savagery and violence
5815396 no doubt yet we sporelings had nothing they wanted besides the bonechewers were well aware that more of us lived to the west if they became too much of a problem they knew we would destroy them one sporeling is weak but a thousand ten thousand
5815397 what about when the bonechewer clan joined with the horde
5815398 we began to worry when more orcs started to arrive in zangarmarsh but all the bonechewer warriors went north
5815399 not in any official capacity its a good thing too we would lack the advantage of numbers against so many clans you can probably guess what happened after the breaking a single day saw the destruction of ancient sporekish and most of my race we did not expect to survive but somehow we did
5815400 some do in shattrath city in fact we established the eastern colony in order to better communicate with them the climate in shattrath is too dry to establish a colony and it lacks a spawning zone zangarmarsh is the only hope for our race
5815401 govern the sporeling exists to ensure the health of the colony and the colony exists to perpetuate the species as primus i am a record keeper the primus is born with greater mental capacity than other castes but we are not really leaders i do not have what irianne describes as personal ambition
5815402 the harvesters grow mushrooms and maintain the compost and preservers defend and forage we used to have seers who developed new types of fungus none survived the breaking and we cannot yet able to make new ones
5815403 do you think that the preservers should attempt to expand sporeggars sphere of influence
5815404 thank you again for joining us mr allicant it means a great deal to everyone in sporeggar
5815405 its the least i could do theyve been very good hosts
5815406 the walkers stand and wait all around the spawning glen
5815407 they wait for hatched spore spawn who escape the glen the marshfolk call them kings but theyre nothing more than vultures
5815408 sporeling spawn often wander the glen not knowing where to go the sporelings created this formula which will attract them to us
5815409 destron irianne open fire on the second giant we shall finish the first
5815410 temoril made them we sporelings do not work with stone but he said he had great experience working on something called the temple of the moon i have not seen it but im sure it is quite impressive

5815436 skylab was launched 14 may 1973 by a saturn int 21 a two stage version of the saturn v launch vehicle into a 235 nautical mile 435 km orbit the launch is sometimes referred to as skylab 1 or sl 1 severe damage was sustained during launch including the loss of the stations micrometeoroid shield sun shade and one of its main solar panels debris from the lost micrometeoroid shield further complicated matters by pinning the remaining solar panel to the side of the station preventing its deployment and thus leaving the station with a huge power deficit the station underwent extensive repair during a spacewalk by the first crew which launched on 25 may 1973 the sl 2 mission atop a saturn ib if the crew had failed to repair skylab in time the plastic insulation inside the station would have melted releasing poisonous gas and making skylab completely uninhabitable they stayed in orbit with skylab for 28 days two additional missions followed on 28 july 1973 sl 3 and 16 november 1973 sl 4 with stay times of 59 and 84 days respectively the last skylab crew returned to earth on 8 february 1974

5815461 several decades ago a great drought lay upon the land thirsty people looked every place for water but it could not be found today however water is flowing and readily available as books articles and journals pay more attention to the holy spirit and related subjects the level of evangelical scholarship has moved up and the effect of the charismatic renewal more than lingers pentecostal and charismatic scholars have ascended into the rain clouds of the academy to release much needed water to the earth below for the pentecostal preacher abundant secondary sources exist through these sources persistent and concerned students can access references to primary material about the spirit these sources also feature prominent hermeneutical methods that demonstrate how scholars deal with the biblical text in its ancient environment consequently preachers can observe and learn techniques not used by evangelicals let alone pentecostals some three or four decades ago they can become aware of what others are thinking writing and discussing in colleges universities and seminaries to a great degree this shows the growth and sophistication of charismatic and pentecostal traditions many of the authors whose work is referred to in this review belong to these traditions and stand tall among biblical scholars
5815462 when was the last time you stepped into a museum yet alone a small independent cutting edge gallery
5815463 i am grateful for the work of peter davids whose lifelong interest in the general epistles is well known and widely respected and whose mix of service in both academic and ecclesiastical settings has doubtless contributed to his ability on the one hand to form sharp independent judgments and on the other to apply them to the contemporary church in epistles so controverted no commentary including this one will win universal agreement but all of us will happily acknowledge how much we stand in debt to dr davids

5815466 i have found that regular fasting helps me to direct my heart toward god and humble myself before him when i started i thought i could fast for a particular prayer request but eventually i became overwhelmed when i realized i would have to fast every day to cover all the requests i then changed my approach i began fasting just as a spiritual discipline before god to humble my heart so i that could seek to please him more fully god does not hear my prayers because i fast but because i am his child who loves him but i keep my love for him more attentive by spiritual disciplines jesus is my atonement and sin offering fasting serves more like a freewill offering or thank offering a way i can voluntarily demonstrate further to devotion to him
5815467 as a young christian i witnessed in some situations in which suffering was likely two weeks in a row i had led someone to christ on sunday night in a particular part of town the third week i decided to try it again unfortunately the first person i spoke to was not in a pleasant mood he descended on me immediately with anger pummeling me with his fists and kicking me i managed to get away with him cursing that he would kill me if he saw me again on some occasions when i was beaten the physical pain remained for several days after the beating once however the lord mercifully caused me to feel nothing though my hair was being torn out and my head was being repeatedly slammed against the floor

5815492 the u s is now the worlds largest wind energy producer with wind development sparking job creation and economic opportunity in a troubled economy
5815493 but the current figures hide a dire reality the pipeline of investment for 2009 has been on hold for months with escalating risks and costs for the industry because of the uncertainty about the production tax credit at a time when unemployment is at a 4 year high and the economy needs every stimulus it can get a rapid extension of the credit should be on any economic priority list for congress
5815494 its clear that wind power is not only a major technology with which to fight climate change but also one of the most promising and dynamic economic engines we have today
5815495 the nation needs an ambitious plan to promote the deployment of wind and other renewable energy technologies and the urgent first step it must take is to rapidly extend the expiring renewable energy credits which are the primary incentive that the nation provides for these technologies today
5815496 the goal is not to capture the entire upside of asia but to provide a more stable profile that investors can stay with over time
5815497 the big driver will have to be policies that encourage investments in wind generation systems and break down barriers

5815512 georgias borders have been reaffirmed by numerous security council resolutions
5815513 so the question of abkhazia and south ossetia will be the subject of international negotiations as they have been at the u n security council

5815583 este o meu trabalho e queria pelo menos dar uma final aos portugueses
5815584 im not thinking the way i used to think i can feel it most strongly when im reading immersing myself in a book or a lengthy article used to be easy my mind would get caught up in the narrative or the turns of the argument and id spend hours strolling through long stretches of prose thats rarely the case anymore now my concentration often starts to drift after two or three pages i get fidgety lose the thread begin looking for something else to do i feel as if im always dragging my wayward brain back to the text the deep reading that used to come naturally has become a struggle
5815585 the net seems to be chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation my mind now expects to take in information the way the net distributes it in a swiftly moving stream of particles once i was a scuba diver in the sea of words now i zip along the surface like a guy on a jet ski
5815586 a lovely illustration of the fact that since the dawn of popular medicine our cultural concerns about changes in society are likely to be expressed in the language of illness and disease
5815587 this is not to say that all fears about new technologies are unfounded
5815588 but its clear that they are quickly medicalised and get far more prominence than the evidence supports both in the 19th century and in the 21st
5815589 and they need to know that those regulations are going to be checked on and enforced
5815590 if that had gave way the plexiglas and the tiger would have been right out in the sidewalk on people not just with people but on people
5815591 and what they had told me was prior to putting those cubs in there the female tiger was in there
5815592 assuage loneliness or in an attempt to reach out and form social connections with others
5815593 it is important for social scientists to continue to examine this phenomenon to fully understand its affects on psychological processes that differentiate it from other similar forms of self expression
5815594 its kind of sad that the attacks could have been prevented
5815595 maybe if we had had some oversight it wouldnt have happened
5815596 the first couple times it was hard to get people in the house to realize it was an issue once we did a little educating people realized it was important we were able to get a lot of support when it got to the senate we had to start that education process over again hopefully this year well make some progress
5815597 before id always tried to tell people we needed to take care of this problem before a bad situation happened
5815598 ill remind people they had a chance to take care of it before
5815599 i think people will be open to some kind of oversight to try to keep this from happening again
5815600 in many cases weve found that the registration process is not happening or being enforced
5815601 its hard if you dont know the animals are there to go and enforce it
5815602 if they cant do that themselves then the state has to regulate them
5815603 as the north wind brings rain so slander brings angry looks
5815604 all a mans ways seem innocent to him but motives are weighed by the lord

5815606 bless you all hardship and pain you have cut me off from the death of prosperous idolatry again and again
5815607 i feel a strong sense of belonging to my organisation
5815608 even if it were to my advantage i do not feel it would be right to leave my organisation now
5815609 i believe that i have too few options to consider leaving this organisation
5815610 older people are motivated to volunteer because of their wish to fulfil an obligation or commitment to society
5815611 communicate how their goals values and culture are congruent to the individuals beliefs
5815612 this study showed that the absence of the stick of paid work does not lead to the situation that volunteers leave their tasks very easily
5815613 as indicated by their commitment there seems to be an interdependence even though volunteers are not paid for their contribution they may need the organisation as much as the organisation needs them
5815614 t he emotions of pride and shame may have evolved innate nonverbal expressions challenging the long standing assumption in the emotion literature that only a small set of emotions fit within the darwinian framework
5815615 the relevant section concerns the testing of a particular two year old boy in his remote home village a group of bureaucrats brought with them the belongings of the late 13th dalai lama along with a set of inauthentic items that were similar or identical to these belongings when presented with an authentic black rosary and a copy of one the boy grabbed the real one and put it around his neck when presented with two yellow rosaries he again grasped the authentic one when offered two canes he at first picked up the wrong one then after closer inspection he put it back and selected the one that had belonged to the dalai lama he then correctly identified the authentic one of three quilts
5815616 we take this as evidence of the ubiquity naturalness and importance of psychological essentialism
5815617 if you really are the dalai lama prove it by demonstrating knowledge that a random child would not know

5815986 our liberties do not come from charters for these are only the declaration of preexisting rights they do not depend on parchments or seals but come from the king of kings and the lord of all the earth
5815987 bread is important freedom is more important but most important of all is fidelity and faithful adoration
5815988 destroys the wisdom of the wise and wrecks the understanding of those who understand
5815989 is a scandal to the jews and foolishness to the gentiles
5815990 the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men
5815991 the pope likes new york and what it stands for
5815992 i think hes really fascinated by the city and what it represents
5815993 its about people being two things at once like italian americans or chinese americans hes interested in that idea of coexistence
5815994 the democratic pluralistic values that constitute on our good days the american brand
5815995 in a critical hour council leadership passed from europe to the young churches of america and their allies
5815996 did not extend to an acceptance that all roads to salvation are equal or to a license for democracy within his church
5815997 he seems to recognize that were plain speakers we dont hide behind words
5815998 through the great sphere of worldly experience that the church has in america

5816000 less interested in scolding american catholics than in talking up new religious communities
5816001 eruptions of non state related religious vitality at which he thinks we excel
5816002 there are times when benedicts love affair with american religious pluralism seems a bit naive especially when it clashes with his nonnegotiable doctrinal stands
5816003 downplaying the idea that catholics may legitimately balance church teaching against the demands of their conscience
5816004 america is simultaneously a completely modern and a profoundly religious place in the world it is unique in this
5816005 and ratzinger wants to understand how those two aspects can coexist
5816006 democracy in america has always made a strong impression on me
5816007 to each citizen the right to live his own religious faith with genuine freedom including in the public realm
5816008 a commitment to guarantee to all individuals and groups respect for the exigencies of the common good and the possibility to live and to express one own religious convictions
5816009 the framers and the faithful how modern evangelicals are ignoring their own history

5816016 just structures without which a just order in society is not possible
5816017 church and economy responsibility for the future of the world economy
5816018 the objection raised especially after the second vatican council that the autonomy of specialized realms is to be respected above all
5816019 identify the ground of their misery in the market economy which they see as a system of exploitations as institutionalised sin and injustice
5816020 the decline of such discipline can actually cause the laws of the market to collapse
5816021 support must be given to all those who are examples of honesty in the administration of public finances and of justice
5816022 the rule of law is the necessary condition for the establishment of an authentic democracy
5816023 there is no authentic and stable democracy without social justice thus the church needs to pay greater attention to the formation of consciences which will prepare the leaders of society for public life at all levels promote civic education respect for law and for human rights and inspire greater efforts in the ethical training of political leaders
5816024 depending on the moral disposition of the actors within the market
5816025 no matter how sublime the theology it is no substitute for genuine economic knowledge especially when the goal is to analyze economic structures in terms of their moral significance
5816026 nuanced synthesis of free market economic science and the science of moral theology grounded in a personalist anthropology
5816027 i am catholic i love america and so should you
5816028 what does american patriotism mean to the serious and devout catholic
5816029 how can american patriotism be apprehended in a manner consistent with the tenets of the catholic faith

5816031 his music is by no means just entertainment it contains the whole tragedy of human existence
5816032 this cold war era cartoon uses humor to tout the dangers of communism and the benefits of capitalism
5816033 i think that on the whole the faith that democratic capitalism is the answer is one that tends to characterize the neocon project
5816034 predicated on a sincere religious faith in a false god and that gods power to redeem and heal
5816035 are a means to freedom but they are not identical with freedom itself
5816036 it is the way in which they are conceived and the way in which they are used that will ultimately determine their efficacy as instruments of freedom
5816037 never in the history of the world has any soldier sacrificed more for the freedom and liberty of total strangers than the american soldier
5816038 the founding fathers of the united states asserted their claim to freedom and independence on the basis of certain
5816039 the american democratic experiment has been successful in many ways millions of people around the world look to the united states as a model in their search for freedom dignity and prosperity but the continuing success of american democracy depends on the degree to which each new generation native born and immigrant makes its own moral truths on which the founding fathers staked the future of your republic
5816040 i am happy to take note of your words confirming the importance that your government attaches in its relations with countries around the world to the promotion of human rights and particularly to the fundamental human right of religious freedom which is the guarantee of every other human right
5816041 our liberties do not come from the charters for these are only declarations of preexisting rights they do not depend on parchment or seals but come from the king of kings and the lord of all the earth
5816042 a thoughtful intelligent albeit somewhat snarky view of politics law and culture
5816043 the eye of the needle economic lessons from the parables
5816044 of course we all knew they were crooks before this weeks verdict but do they represent the moral core of american capitalism
5816045 a utilitarian who became a liberal but never understood the limits of reason
5816046 his home schooling at the hands of his father the economist and historian james mill was a model of rigor causing him to read and write greek aged 6 to master latin aged 9 and to have acquired a thorough grounding in history and mathematics aged 10 when he began work on a history of roman government
5816047 communism is the only political system to have created its own international brand of comedy the standard interpretation is that communist jokes were a form of resistance but they were also a safety valve for the regimes and jokes were told by the rulers as well as the ruled even stalin told some good ones
5816048 there have been few personalities throughout history who have encapsulated the theological tension within christianity with reference to pacifism and war like dietrich bonhoeffer bonhoeffers dilemma as he watched his country descend into the horror and depravity of naziism speaks in a larger sense to all christians who wrestle with matters of conscience war and civil resistance

5816050 a state does not consist of individuals that are all a like
5816051 the hollowness of so much of american life the vacant eyes watching television and drinking beer the tired eyes of the men on the commuter train the efficient eyes of the professor and manager the sincere eyes of the television politician americans do not know who they are only what they are useful for they are bored and apathetic because they are manipulated they are violent because they secretly resent the lies they are forced to live unable to live with themselves americans level the earth build and destroy attempt to master matter and space and human history americans play god
5816052 the term was invented as a sign of excommunication by the catholic socialist and my good friend michael harrington
5816053 obviously he had not gone on a cross country trip of america
5816054 always remember america is about people it is a land of course and what a land but it is above all a people the most varied amalgam of people of all races and cultures the world has ever seen
5816055 then he was a loner a vegetarian and a pacifist today he is the head of a large family the owner of a cattle farm and a supporter of president bush and the war in iraq
5816056 marketimer subscribers have been able to add to position on this short term correction based on our recommendation to view the stock market as attractive for purchase on any weakness into the s amp p 500 index range any minor weakness below that level has been contained in the area of the august 15 correction bottom in the several excellent buying opportunities occurred during the month of november
5816057 we continue to believe that a bear market s amp p index decline in excess of 20 is not on the radar screen at this time we expect the bull market to continue at least well into 2008 and we look for significant stock market gains including new s amp p 500 record highs
5816058 in summary the marketimer stock market timing model indicates that conditions are favorable for the market as we enter 2008 we expect the s amp p index to achieve new record highs this year and to reach the 1600s rang in the process we continue to rate the market attractive for purchase on any weakness into the s amp p 500 index range above this range we prefer a dollar cost average approach for new purchases all marketimer model portfolios remain fully invested as we enter 2008

5816090 for sherlyn to say yes to bigg boss she needs a great incentive
5816091 only if she gets what she deserves to be away for a full three months from the promotions of her latest musical success dard e sherlyn will she agree to be on the show
5816092 with her characteristic boldness and flamboyance she is able and capable to make trps of any tv programme hit the roof and we all know that
5816093 but im sure she wont be interested in it without the perks
5816094 in the beginning everything seems nice to have a young hot beautiful girl as your wife then you tend to get suspicious and the world becomes your enemy you tend to try to protect her from your lecherous and slimy neighbors and friends it is like pure mohalle se dushmani leni padti hai
5816095 if i have made urmilas career with rangeela then what have i done with drohi manoj bajpayee had better role in satya but was there anything wrong with him in road and shool its only after utilizing the time and space properly that someone makes his or her position concrete in this industry its again about the combination of hard work and luck also and i think no one can even think about making his position as because things get done by itself only
5816096 i am not ready to take the credit for any actor or technician
5816097 i always prefer to take the responsibility of whatever goes wrong with any project as because they always give their level best and if something goes wrong then it has to be because of my wrong instructions
5816098 it is a comedy show that will be aired once a week but i would not claim that this show is hugely different from the other comedy serials you see on television at the same time i must admit that we are trying to make it a shade different from the run of the mill you fare you see on television today
5816099 i am playing the role of vikas puri who hails from a typical punjabi family they are always loud and show their emotions irrespective of whether they are sad or happy
5816100 smita bansal divya paani is playing my love interest in the serial she comes from a typical up market chic family her father is a retired intelligence officer who grills me every time we meet
5816101 even today people associate me with my character in sarabhai versus sarabhai while it is a great satisfaction for me to think that my role is so popular even today i think it is time to get out of that image i spent the last two and half years in toning my body and looking different using todays lingo i am going in for an image makeover

5816113 same thing with dvds i stopped buying them when it became clear thanks to the no skip piracy warnings that the movie industry thinks every customer is a thief
5816114 you keep using that word i do not think it means what you think it means
5816115 we dont see it as a niche entertainment site we see it as a pop culture site so much of our mainstream culture is now talked about and thought about in science fictional terms i think thats why people like william gibson and brian aldiss are saying theres no more science fiction because we are now living in the future the present is thinking of itself in science fictional terms you get things like george bush taking stem cell policy from reading parts of brave new world thats part of what we are playing with we are living in world that now thinks of itself in terms of sci fi and in terms of the future
5816116 i was planning a trip to india and really wanted the full native experience and the money i made begging meant that my temporary leprosy totally paid for itself

5816128 when i marry alexis a friend of his big sister we are going to sit around a fire on saturday nights too
5816129 the surveys core result is that people care about their communities and express the desire to see government action taken toward local and national issues
5816130 people are hesitant to support efforts concerning global issues even though they believe that environmental quality is poorer at the global level than at the local and national level this is surprising given the media attention that global warming has recently received and reflects the division of opinion about the severity of climate change
5816131 americans are clearly most concerned about pollution issues that might affect their personal health or the health of their families
5816132 this essential treaty has languished in limbo for more than a decade largely due to the failure of nations in not signing up to what they long ago agreed to
5816133 because most of the worlds transboundary river basins lack adequate legal protection the world needs a global framework for sustainably managing and preventing disputes over those resources and this is the only such framework available in the timescale to help us deal with a growing water crisis
5816134 now when there are increasing water shortages and water quality issues world wide and climate change will only make things worse is when we need to have an effective and widely accepted agreement of global scope covering shared freshwater resources
5816135 this is about national and global security as much as human and water security
5816136 the experts are telling us that rivalries over water will be a significant source of future conflict as indeed they already are
5816137 an essential element of the response to our current water crisis and the looming escalation of that crisis is on the shelf and ready to go all we need is for the worlds nations to match their actions on water to their rhetoric
5816138 given the fact that the flow of the jordan river is largely appropriated for what are viewed as key economic and social uses good water management within the basin may have to be combined with a water transfer from outside the jordan basin to restore the dead sea level to a reasonable level
5816139 its like asking a cat to guard a bowl of milk
5816140 the victims were all very poor people living in old and dilapidated buildings
5816141 so far we have received reports about the partial or full collapse of as many as 890 houses
5816142 no one has been killed so far but flood waters have submerged parts of a highway
5816143 i left all my gold everything but i am alive
5816144 we dont know nothing about those who were left behind but we heard from our neighbors that they were all shot
5816145 for years we had been living in a situation where the sound of shooting had become a part of our daily life and we did not leave our home we hoped to return but now it is over my house is in ruins
5816146 fourteen people live in one room with seven beds but we have water and electricity we were really lucky
5816147 but after these guys return from fire alarms they have no place to rest so we were told we have to find another place to stay in two three days
5816148 i have two children 11 and 10 and my husband i left there kurta the administrative center of georgian controlled south ossetia we went through all this and here they treat us like beggars
5816149 there was no water no light and dirty and damp rooms thats where they took us
5816150 the defects in addressing the idps problems have become very obvious today
5816151 could be released as soon as the assessment of the needs will be finalized on the ground
5816152 as the world flips over from a predominantly rural to a predominantly urban population base cities are going to take more and more water for agriculture
5816153 however most of the water going into urban areas comes out the other end in the sewers
5816154 we know that there is an informal sector within many cities that is using wastewater to grow vegetables but there has been no data on how much of this water was being used or what the risks were
5816155 it is a pretty useful way of treating water in the sense that if the water just went straight into a river it would cause a lot more eutrophication problems further downstream
5816156 so in a way it is performing an ecological service by cleaning up some of the water and recycling the nutrients
5816157 if this practice is going to be increasingly commonplace and more and more people are going to be eating food produced this way then there needs to be a bit more concern about the heavy metals and other contaminants in there
5816158 ideally the end product should be treating the water to a standard that means there is no risk but most developing nations cannot afford to do this
5816159 apparently what happens now in areas with very polluted water is that the farmers do a smell test or a taste test
5816160 this case demonstrates the lengths to which some drug companies will go to increase sales of their products how direct to consumer advertising can promote irrational drug use and how weak regulation can foster irresponsible corporate behavior
5816161 kelloggs are one of a number of international food companies that make money by selling products high in fat sugar and or salt threatened with litigation in the us kelloggs have agreed to change some of their marketing practices however we believe they are doing too little too late
5816162 this is a classic case of avoiding accountability and shifting responsibility on a global scale wherever the fault lies the safety of consumers was compromised and this should be the full focus of mattels attention not finger pointing and not blame dodging
5816163 these multi billion dollar companies are global brands with a responsibility to be honest accountable and responsible in highlighting their shortcomings consumers international and its 220 member organizations are holding corporations to account and demanding businesses take social responsibility seriously
5816164 we respect their religion we respect everything they do and believe in but they have never turned around to us and said you have to be a part of this because thats not what theyre about its never been about that theres been nothing shoved down our throats because friends dont do things like that they are amazing people who are just so positive about life and they have been great to us
5816165 for having the same acoustic guitar drum loop courtesy of we belong together
5816166 semester upon semester of saying the news isnt in the relative clause
5816167 building a cobre center means building something bigger than any one lab
5816168 our center brings together colleagues core service laboratories and specialists at four campuses as a result we learn from each other accelerate each others research and enable things that couldnt be done by individuals working alone in addition were helping to train a new generation of faculty researchers and their students thats what makes it all so worthwhile
5816169 all of our initial goals for the cobre have been met and in most cases surpassed by a wide margin
5816170 outstanding highly productive scientists with a strong record of success during the initial funding period that attests to their ability to plan and execute this program
5816171 there is a critical mass of strong productive investigators collaborating in a multidisciplinary research center pursuing important and long term health related research
5816172 there is no electricity and the drinking water is from the local fountain
5816173 i can work later at night its good for my studies i can read a book
5816174 we have just started to make these lanterns in burkina faso and sold about 3 000 so far
5816175 so they can take this money for other things like food or medicine
5816176 there are fewer people reporting eye problems to the local hospital
5816177 brown carbon has light absorbing properties that lie between strongly absorbing black carbon and materials that only scatter light and do not absorb
5816178 but more studies on the chemical structure and size of brown carbon particles must be done
5816179 not only has it reduced its carbon footprint since its renovation it has also reduced its energy usage uses less water and no longer sends waste to landfill it will also continue to produce great quality clothing
5816180 in order to be a world class green manufacturer the factory will be adapting to innovative solutions in conservation of energy sourcing of renewable energy including solar power environmental preservation and employee wellbeing all geared towards achieving carbon neutrality
5816181 being green is not very easy it is a very expensive process but within a year we were able to complete it and commence operations in my view it is quite an achievement for hirdaramani
5816182 foreign buyers are now more interested in buying from environmentally friendly manufacturers buyers from the us for instance are very interested in sourcing from green factories because today there are a lot of problems due to pollution and issues like global warming so this is going to be the new standard
5816183 mom i think i need to pray to god and thank him again for giving us a baby
5816184 because the public is interested and involved and because historical precedent is important the solution i preferred and sent last week to some of those involved in the prague discussions would have been to accept the nine planets we have had for most of a century and add anything as big or bigger than pluto to the list of planets
5816185 um are the smoothies on sale or something this week
5816186 well i was just wondering if the sign said that or something
5816187 i actually dont care what we have i just want a healthy baby because we waited so long for this one
5816188 that sends a key signal to automakers and to parts suppliers such as battery makers and what not to gear up their efforts to supply millions of hybrids not just to fleets but to general consumers in the immediate time frame
5816189 we have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch
5816190 the main principle of industrial ecology is to try and use our waste products to produce something of value
5816191 were looking at dumping the whole dinner on top of them and seeing what happens
5816192 it is just easier for japanese to hide making a scene would be too embarrassing
5816193 the study reinforces the notion that sexual orientation is hard wired in the brain it suggests sexual behavior is encoded in our genes
5816194 they look like girls but act and think like boys
5816195 they have genes for both male behaviour and female behaviour in them it suggests the brain determines behaviour
5816196 for the most part they are females its really hard to tell that they are hermaphrodites but they do make these few sperm
5816197 a humans brain is much more complex than a worms brain
5816198 she has a strong background working with business and industry which will help us strengthen our graduate degrees to meet their needs
5816199 we feel very lucky to hire someone of her caliber

5816203 weve had a situation where day after day week after week month after month weve had rockets fired from gaza by extremists designed to kill our people the israeli cabinet has decided that this situation just cant go on and we will act to defend our citizens
5816204 this would be just another tightening of the knot on gaza
5816205 there should be no sanctions against the palestinian people neither individual nor collective punishment it will harm our bilateral relations it will harm our discussions and negotiations it will harm the atmosphere and even sabotage it

5816210 the piano driven track combines keys soft voice with lyrics about appreciating the time we have
5816211 im going to say something thats going to get me in trouble they accuse me of being anti gay and a bigot we dont believe in discrimination we dont believe in hatred and if you do you are in the wrong place at the wrong time thats the whole premise of god thats the whole premise of christ is love love love but there is a side of christ that deals in judgment and all sin is against god dont call me a bigot or anti gay when i have been touched by the same feelings when i have suffered with the same feelings dont call me a homophobe when i love everybody dont tell me that i stand up and i say vile words against the gay community because i dont i dont speak against the homosexual i tell you that god delivered me from homosexuality
5816212 i will be fit to fulfill my role in every way before the treatment and a few hours after it it is my intention to continue to work and to devote myself entirely to running the affairs of state
5816213 by 1966 the virus first starts spreading in ha ti a few years later one variant from ha ti gives rise to what would then light the fuse and explode around the world as the aids pandemic that we first became aware of
5816214 if you project that out to the entire gay community in the country thats a lot of guys
5816215 men have few places they can turn for help they also have to battle societal perceptions they might already feel stigma for being gay and could feel additional stigma for being abused its used as a power tactic in controlling someone its master manipulation
5816216 the first incarnation was radio engineer golden age of comics
5816217 the biggest challenge in setting up lantern was waiting for the technology to become available to create fantastical worlds as well as overcoming the prejudice of a ring bearing hero
5816218 to me this was on the last great comic book movie that hasnt been made it was a comic book with a real mythology that you would see in a lot of the space operas and the sci fi books the best part about it anybody can be become one of the green lanterns because anyone can end up with that ring the danger and the fear from a lot of people is that it would be silly in these post lord of the rings days its not any more fantastical than that its taken movies like that to make it feel as if a green lantern film is possible
5816219 the shift could allow for a greater aerial assault and help firefighters beat back the most destructive blazes
5816220 have been working with other federal state and local authorities to identify the source of the fires
5816221 it is an absolute fact had we had more air resources we would have been able to control this fire
5816222 eight of the states nine water dumping helicopters were in southern california by sunday when the first fires began along with 13 air tankers
5816223 anyone that is complaining about the planes just wants to complain because theres a bunch of nonsense the fact is that we could have all the planes in the world here we have 90 aircraft here and six that we got especially from the federal government and they cant fly because of the wind situation
5816224 i dont believe that even from a religious point of view that jesus ever discriminated toward anyone nor do i most of the things that were said were totally out of context and then other things werent true my only concern is to be in place with senator obama in unity and bring all the factors together for the sake of change thats my only thing of course some agents have twisted it as though he obama were embracing a racist or a nazi and that is anything but true i believe in his stance i believe in his platform and his agenda so when they asked me if i would be a part of it there was no problem we dont have to agree on everything but we do have to agree on the main thing that there needs to be change and i believe he is the candidate to bring it theres never been a statement made by me about curing homosexuality people are using that in order to incite anger and to twist my whole platform on it theres no crusade for curing it or to convert everyone this is just for those who come to me and ask for change
5816225 singapore is basically a conservative society the family is the basic building block of this society and by family in singapore we mean one man one woman marrying having children and bringing up children within that framework of a stable family unit
5816226 the more gay activists push this agenda the stronger will be the push back from conservative forces in our society the result will be counterproductive because its going to lead to less space for the gay community in singapore
5816227 were obviously very disappointed that parliament has decided to retain section 377a but the petitioners feel that the way moving forward probably would not be to continue politicizing or lobbying directly for a repeal but working with society and within the community to try to foster a greater understanding
5816228 whose common object is to commit any offense and not just those relating to public tranquility
5816229 in latin america the use of condoms has been demonized but if they were used in everyrelation i guarantee the epidemic would be resolved in the region the fact young people start to be sexually active between 15 and 19 without sex education contributes to the spreading of the virus as well as the fact that the evidence shows abstinence is not working
5816230 this is the biggest study thats ever looked at the possible protective effect of alcohol involving the lung we found that that if you drank less than two glasses of alcohol per day of wine beer or hard liquor that you had much less likelihood of developing obstructive airways disease which includes emphysema you do seem to get some benefit if you drink three to five drinks per day but it wasnt as good if you drank just a little and if you drank six or more it actually had a bad effect it made your lung function worse
5816231 there was a little more of a positive impact for women but not a huge difference and in fact when we looked at three to five drinks per day then the men did better than the women
5816232 these are interesting studies but first of all there is simply not that much literature on alcohol and lung function so yes there is this thought that one or two glasses of alcohol is good for your heart and too much is not good for your health in general and i guess their findings go along with that general statement but nevertheless id say the jury is still out on the other hand theres a lot of literature on vitamin supplementation as it relates to chronic lung disease there is a lot of evidence that diets loaded with what are considered healthy nutrients fruits grains those kind of things are associated with better lung health than those that are not but attempts to supplement diets with vitamins in order to improve lung health have not been terribly successful and this vitamin study was very very small so while i understand that certainly people would much rather make themselves well with diet than they would with medication its important to recognize that this is very hard research to do so far the attempts to sort of pluck out the ingredients that we think are the keys ones havent been very successful much more work is needed
5816233 it was surprising to see how consistent it was that gay men tended to be more discriminated against in traditionally heterosexual male dominated professions blue collar labor and management too
5816234 if employers perceive one group to be generally less productive or more costly than other groups individual members of the negatively perceived group will receive lower wage offers regardless of their true characteristics
5816235 employers could reasonably infer that a lesbian applicant or current employee will have a stronger attachment to the labor force than will a heterosexual woman
5816236 with the winds blowing in and the currents in the public education program manager chris parry said of the garbage heap
5816237 at this point cleaning it up isnt an option its just going to get bigger as our reliance on plastics continues the long term solution is to stop producing as much plastic products at home and change our consumption habits
5816238 these animals die because the plastic eventually fills their stomachs it doesnt pass and they literally starve to death
5816239 what we can do is ban plastic fast food packaging or require the substitution of biodegradable materials increase recycling programs and improve enforcement of litter laws otherwise this ever growing floating continent of trash will be with us for the foreseeable future
5816240 tuscany is at the forefront and the rest of italy should follow it
5816241 is too biology centric of course for a homosexual it is natural to be gay but im not too sure it is determined by genetics
5816242 exploiting newborns to suggest that homosexual tendencies are innate is a misleading and shameful act
5816243 i met him in a hotel lobby in new york city and he came in just from the gym and i was sitting there and i was like wow and i pretty much saw everything the whole package
5816244 the most common hiccup is the first child and it turns into all about the kids which is understandable because theyre miraculous but then youve got to put each other first you know she will always be number one for me
5816245 waiting year after year we can see into the future together with hard work and sweat weve created the five different olympic colors
5816246 it wasnt a shock for me i found out probably a year or two after we broke up people magazine was not my first time knowing lance was gay he is an awesome guy he was an awesome boyfriend and he is still a very good friend of mine
5816247 we dont have time now to get into long discussions on blame
5816248 we shouldnt make any moral judgments on this war stopping the war thats what were interested in dont ask us whos good and whos bad here
5816249 its natural to seek an arrest warrant after determining that there was a crime
5816250 no matter what you think about whaling physical protests should be avoided
5816251 even small traces are extremely toxic as they persist in the body for a long time and accumulate in the human tissues
5816252 if we do not respect nature then we are not respecting god
5816253 never underestimate the power of a few committed people to change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has
5816254 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
5816255 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special
5816256 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the project it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
5816257 that kind of money is not going to change anything however i see these initial funds as important elements to create a new economic paradigm for the amazon
5816258 it is much more important they the funds are used to develop alternatives not only for law enforcement
5816259 otherwise it will be very difficult even with large inflows of money to protect the forest because you almost need a police state you almost need the army deployed all over the amazon
5816260 it just postpones deforestation but its not a final solution the final fix is to create a new economy that can give jobs to several million people
5816261 the amazon lacks badly entrepreneurs perhaps thats the thing it lacks the most to go there with good ideas and translate biodiversity wealth into economic wealth
5816262 you can even think now of a system in which using the satellite you will spot the deforestation and a couple of months later that person if he is unable to explain that was legal immediately that person is blacklisted for loans
5816263 that will have a tremendous impact because most of the operations they depend on those loans
5816264 even if all countries stop deforestation tomorrow and then within 100 years global warming changes 4 5 degrees further then forget it the tipping point will have been reached
5816265 fell apart when tommy left he was the glue of the ramones

5816267 johnny was a super hard ass but they probably wouldnt even be a band if he hadnt taken control
5816268 we used to call them the marones because johnny was such a drill sergeant theyre not the marines theyre the marones
5816269 everyplace i go i see exactly the same thing they all recognize that to be successful going forward they have to know understand and use technology
5816270 they have to use technology in education economic development health care and communicating with their citizens every nation realizes this is the wave of the future
5816271 if youre in sub saharan africa today you dont give a damn about whats going on in wall street you care about whats going on locally you need local content for education for business for jobs employment for agriculture you need local content for citizens to interact with their governments
5816272 a good teacher is the best tool for a good education anywhere in the world
5816273 some whiteboard makers are probably very happy about your invention
5816274 we tend to think of the bottom of the pyramid as people who deserve our pity or people that deserve donations but in fact most people at that stage are actually starting business that are quite profitable and quite successful and have high repayment possibilities
5816275 we should see 50 million people covered by wimax by years end
5816276 if i were one of the people who started the fires i would not sleep soundly right now because were right behind you
5816277 we should really be in prevention mode putting in place sound measures for suppressing the vector population so we can at least dampen down the epidemic
5816278 we are now concentrating our efforts to completely wipe out dengue outbreaks to prevent possible flare ups next year
5816279 ive come here to urge them to prepare for the worst scenario
5816280 experts say its partly due to global warming because its increased the amount of water not only sea water but fresh water where mosquitoes breed
5816281 physical features will be driven by indicators of health youth and fertility that men and women have evolved to look for in potential mates

5816285 it has been a huge job for me so im praying for the new editor
5816286 being an editor of a publication like this is like a dark hole for time it can be very labor intensive if you want quality
5816287 nationally we have worked to publish something that pushes the boundaries and provides new insights
5816288 i think the key to our success has been providing good service to authors and readers were fortunate that dr cortes has the talent and interest to lead it into the future
5816289 dr rider is an outstanding example of the scientists in kansas who educate students and care deeply about their development
5816290 she has formed a nucleus of research scholars at psu that can serve as an example throughout the nation of how students can be assisted as they grow develop and learn to be researchers kansas is enormously proud to have dr rider representing outstanding mentorship for the united states
5816291 my impact on human beings is greater through mentoring students than any research i publish or discoveries in the laboratory

5816400 god told me it was time to be his wife
5816401 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
5816402 as you sit here if you have any illness i can see it and just remove it
5816403 they were sick and we told god and god said their time has come
5816404 they dont want to be parents they want to be cool they want to be hip they dont want to be the bad guy but guess what being the bad guy is your job my mama knew better she wasnt there to make me like her she was there to shape me she was there to make me a good person
5816405 he came on top of the stingray and the stingrays barb went up and into his chest and put a hole into his heart
5816406 the world has lost a great wildlife icon a passionate conservationist and one of the proudest dads on the planet
5816407 he died doing what he loved best and left this world in a happy and peaceful state of mind
5816408 shocked and distressed at steve irwins sudden untimely and freakish death
5816409 he was a wonderful character he was a passionate environmentalist he brought joy and entertainment and excitement to millions of people
5816410 steve was one of these guys we thought of him as invincible
5816411 some people that are doing this stuff are actors and that type of thing but steve was truly a zoologist so to speak a person who knew what he was doing yes he did things a lot of people wouldnt do i think he knew what he was doing
5816412 it was extraordinarily bad luck its not easy to get spined by a stingray and to be killed by one is very rare
5816413 steve from all gods creatures thank you rest in peace
5816414 were all very shocked i dont know what the zoo will do without him hes done so much for us the environment and its a big loss
5816415 thanks allah now i feel comfort today i had my breakfast i was just drinking water nothing else
5816416 had it been broken inside it would be a very very complicated situation
5816417 when i woke up i felt a pain in my lower abdomen but later in hospital they told me this
5816418 i dont know who did this to me police or other prisoners
5816419 i dont know any man who for any amount of money would want to trade and take my clients life
5816420 i think the things got separated in the selection process and the selectors presented the plinth as a complete sculpture
5816421 given their separate submission the two parts were judged independently
5816422 the head was rejected the base was thought to have merit and accepted
5816423 say yes to the will of god and you will never be the same
5816424 cicadas like heat and do their most spirited singing during the hotter hours of a summer day
5816425 it doesnt get that hot its really not that bad
5816426 at the stroke of the midnight hour when the world sleeps india will awake to life and freedom
5816427 with its dilapidated airports crumbling roads vast slums and impoverished villages
5816428 earlycase brings a real understanding to the ediscovery process at the earliest moment the lowest cost and at an unprecedented speed giving clients a more realistic view into what data they have at stake
5816429 i am excited to correspond with you about family and genealogy the majority of genealogical research done is about ones deceased ancestors to actually find living relatives is awesome
5816430 i remember as a small child going to family reunions every year with mema elvira my great grandmother

5816432 warum hat sie sich getrennt von dir wegen zu vieler blondinen auf deinem scho
5816433 ich wei ein multifaktorielles geschehen fehlt sie dir im bett
5816434 vielleicht ist sie keine frau die man ins bett zerren kann
5816435 ich mag es nicht wenn du mir einfach da hinein greifst
5816436 hast du von ihr schon alles gekriegt was du haben wolltest
5816437 aber ich wei nicht genau zu was manchmal denke ich da sie mich deswegen nicht mehr will und da ich sie daf r hasse
5816438 soll ich ein paar eier braten oder lieber r hrei machen
5816439 schmeichelhaft aber f r so umwerfend halte ich mich nicht
5816440 ich glaube das ist das erste mal da mit dem anblick dieser stadt eine frau verf hrt wurde
5816441 glaubst du ehrlich es h tte an der stadt gelegen
5816442 glaubst du ich will mit dir schlafen weil mich irgend etwas so sehr beeindruckt hat

5816444 does our dna have an affect effect on our temporal spiritual lessons and choices or not
5816445 im not quite sure whether they even had had a first lift off
5816446 und du hast du dich schon getrennt von deinem kellner

5816448 ihr wollt euch also alle von den gebrechen der menschheit n hren

5816462 ich habe mich vorhin gef hlt wie damals als wir noch jung waren
5816463 das denkst du nur weil es immer noch passieren k nnte
5816464 o facto de ter sido o nico presidente eleito sobre o qual reca ram suspeitas de favorecimento de interesses particulares as quais nunca foram provadas

5816466 o nico presidente eleito sobre o qual reca ram suspeitas de favorecimento de interesses particulares as quais nunca foram provadas

5816470 sweeping changes in how the district will track and monitor the condition of residential properties
5816471 we can no longer wait for someone to lodge a complaint before we intervene too many tenants are suffering in silence because of fear or financial difficulties we want to get inside these properties on a regular basis to ensure properties are well maintained and remain in good condition
5816472 we have very strict laws to protect tenants in the district of columbia
5816473 and we intend to exhaust all legal options to enforce them
5816474 a crucial piece of the citys efforts to protect renters in rotting buildings

5816476 i did kiss a girl that was my experience the song is really about a curiosity
5816477 i dont care what your genetic makeup is regarding sexual orientation if you have ostensibly female body parts you must be with a man
5816478 it is sad when the sexual outlook of women the molders of civilization becomes so detached from meaningfulness holiness soulfulness that rather than cheating g d forbid they engage in similar activities that they put outside the scope of cheating
5816479 i suppose if melissa etheridge had done a song entitled
5816480 they need to understand that theres a human underneath that suit its getting to the point where this is really a dangerous situation
5816481 obviously it is against city ordinance to shoot fireworks inside the city limits
5816482 youve got to be very dedicated and have a high tolerance for heat you almost have to have a calling from the lord to do this type of work
5816483 im a ninja cat im not coming in im im a ninja cat you cant see me

5816487 ein wenig kleiner als sie bin ich zwar aber ich denke das wird noch gehen

5816489 ja ich wei ich gebe zu viel geld f r kleidung aus
5816490 es gibt d mmeres f r das wir unser geld ausgeben
5816491 immerhin halten uns die schuhe auf dem boden der tatsachen
5816492 wenn der kopf in den wolken schweben m chte braucht es eine gute bodenhaftung
5816493 fahren wir erst zum aldi und dann in die city
5816494 ja und ich w rde gerne noch im b ro vorbei fahren
5816495 sie meinen konkurrenz und entt uschung und erwartungsdruck und all das
5816496 ich denke in zu vieles lassen sie mich schon lange nicht mehr blicken
5816497 die frage m te lauten warum zwei menschen berhaupt zusammen sind
5816498 ach wo chris ist berhaupt nicht romantisch nein im bett
5816499 bis gestern dachte ich auch f r ihn w re das so
5816500 ich glaube ich habe ihm unrecht getan oder nur sehen wollen was ich sehen wollte
5816501 irgendwas sieht er in mir das er ihnen vor die f e werfen will
5816502 besser kann ich es nicht ausdr cken sie m ten es doch wissen
5816503 interessieren sie sich eigentlich auch nur ein wenig f r ihre familie
5816504 ich wollte ihn einmal so sehr da ich bauchschmerzen hatte
5816505 ach wo nur ein streber mit halbwegs modischen klamotten und einem sch chtern l cheln
5816506 er hat sich sehr ge ndert er ist jetzt einer von uns geworden
5816507 ich kann auch warten bis deine tochter vollj hrig ist
5816508 f r roland das was ich einmal f r ihn war
5816509 oha mu ich dir also sofort sagen wenn ich mit roland schlafe
5816510 wenn du die z hne zusammen bei t kannst du bei meinem mann unterschl pfen
5816511 i havent quite figured out what i want to say
5816512 one can make this generalization about men they are ungrateful fickle liars and deceivers they shun danger and are greedy for profit the bond of love is one which men wretched as they are break when it is to their advantage to do so
5816513 some are held to be benefactors others are called grasping some cruel some compassionate one man faithless another faithful
5816514 men are wretched creatures who would not keep their word to you
5816515 one man lascivious another chaste one guileless another crafty one stubborn another flexible
5816516 you constrained by no limits in accordance with your own free will in whose hand we have placed you shall ordain for yourself the limits of you nature
5816517 all things have conspired to your greatness the rest is up to you god does not want to do everything himself and take away from us our free will and our share of the glory which belongs to us
5816518 we call those studies liberal which are worthy of a free man those studies by which we attain and practice virtue and wisdom that education which calls forth trains and develops those highest gifts of body and mind which ennoble men
5816519 the lesson of this research is that variation in the performance of teachers appears to be the result of innate characteristics that are unaffected by training some teachers are good some are bad
5816520 the fact that the sexual pleasure center of your cerebral cortex has been over stimulated by spirochetes is a poor basis for a relationship learned that one the hard way
5816521 there are two kinds of revolutionists as of most things a good kind and a bad the bad revolutionists destroy conventions by appealing to fads fashions that are newer than conventions the good do it by appealing to facts that are older than conventions
5816522 wherever you are be all there live to the hilt every situation you believe to be the will of god
5816523 there once was in man a true happiness of which now remain to him only the mark and empty trace which he in vain tries to fill from all his surroundings seeking from things absent the help he does not obtain in things present but these are all inadequate because the infinite abyss can only be filled by an infinite and immutable object that is to say only by god himself
5816524 a man can no more diminish gods glory by refusing to worship him than a lunatic can put out the sun by scribbling darkness on the wall of his cell
5816525 if you plan to build a tall house of virtues you must first lay deep foundations of humlilty
5816526 give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
5816527 if this shit isnt funny im leaving in ten minutes
5816528 why do they hate women so much why why why
5816529 i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion
5816530 the popularization of schlesinger style surveys freed journalists political commentators museum curators and students of all ages from having to offer evidence in support of their opinions
5816531 the eyes of the world are on guantanamo bay justice must be done there and must be seen to be done there fairly and impartially
5816532 given the danger to the safety of the united states and the nature of international terrorism and to the extent provided by and under this order i find consistent with section 836 of title 10 united states code that it is not practicable to apply in military commissions under this order the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the united states district courts
5816533 the name cia may not be uttered in the courtroom the closest we get is hearing that there might be other government agencies around and there was an incredible moment in the court
5816534 of an fbi witness that must have been about the cia concerning secret cia interrogations of hamdan the government objected on classification grounds the defense lawyer held up the 9 11 commission report and said all i want to do is read one sentence from the 9 11 commission report
5816535 the military commission system theres only been vindication of the power and reason of the six panel members to stand tall take their oaths seriously and do their duty
5816536 the challenge hamdan v rumsfeld and the fight over presidential power
5816537 outcome of hamdans trial could influence not just how terrorism suspects are treated in the future but also whether the whole system that president bush first authorized in the aftermath of sept 11 will survive under the next commander in chief
5816538 unlike sen obama who voted against the military commissions act and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
5816539 underscores the dangerous flaws in the administrations legal framework its time to better protect the american people and our values by bringing swift and sure justice to terrorists through our courts and our uniform code of military justice
5816540 when you lie down with dogs you come up with fleas

5816547 n o sentia que ia defender nada que fosse meu nada me tinha motivado ao longo dos meus vinte anos para arriscar a vida para quem foi habituado a comer a sopa dos pobres na escola para quem sempre teve at aos doze anos a sola dos p s como cal ado para quem foi posto a trabalhar com apenas doze anos de idade ap s ter terminado a quarta classe e tendo de percorrer vinte e quatro quil metros sempre com as soletas enfiadas na cintura para que pudesse caminhar mais depressa e cal ando as s ap s ter atravessado a ponte para que a pol cia n o me multasse por andar descal o a p e sempre a p porque eu ganhava de segunda a s bado a mo o de chapeiro na avenida camilo apenas cinco escudos por dia e o transporte era seis escudos e sessenta centavos por quem tudo isto e muito mais tinha passado como correr os quatro cantos de uma gaveta procura de uma c dea e nada encontrar nada devia sociedade a sociedade que j me devia a mim
5816548 estes mortos n o eram uns mortos quaisquer eram mo os com vinte anos com direito vida e n o me canso de o repetir porque h coisas que devem ser ditas muitas vezes
5816549 era duro trabalhar naquela enfermaria ainda recordo o cabo silvino ter me dito que tinha de arranjar formar de fugir daquela enfermaria se n o morria ou ficava louco mas muito mais duro era ficar destacado no mato e aparecer l num estado como chegaram aqueles e outros desgra ados

5816552 a reversion to not just cold war politics it is a 19 century way of doing politics
5816553 i think its very clear that russian ambitions are to restore the old russian empire not the soviet union but the russian empire
5816554 its a reversion to not just post colonial politics it is a seventh century way of doing politics
5816555 i think its very clear that islamic ambitions are to restore the old caliphate

5816557 if what is happening now had happened in 1996 the btc pipeline would not have been built

5816580 word gets out and the song starts to get played by different worship teams before long its on an album and then suddenly you hear it being sung all over the world
5816581 i just didnt know the church would ever hear it because there was no marketing campaign behind that project it just spread by word of mouth
5816582 i love watching the journey of a song or a worship leader
5816583 it feels much less product and name driven if gods hand is on it then it will naturally happen
5816584 i think that anywhere there are hearts turned to god that are willing to be transparent and vulnerable thats where there is still vibrant worship
5816585 it might look different in different contexts but its still the type of worship the father is looking for along the way the melodies will change and the lyrics depict different aspects of god but the vibrancy is all to do with what is going on in changed lives

5816594 would you lie about your golf score if you knew you could get away with it
5816595 i dont think weve ever known what we were doing
5816596 weve always said god if this is what you want us to do you have to make it happen wherever we go well make it plain who you are that jesus is god and jesus has changed our life
5816597 when we went to ecuador and saw what god was doing through world vision it challenged our hearts we felt like there was not a lot happening through these little dollars that we were giving for child sponsorship but once we got there what seemed like a little bit was really changing entire communities in this country
5816598 we visited one place where the crime rate had literally dropped from 80 percent to 20 percent in just a matter of years
5816599 the truth is what we feel like is insignificant what we feel like is not enough in the hands of jesus he does the miraculous
5816600 i feel like this record is about expectations our expectations of who god is and what hes capable of doing through the messed up people that we are
5816601 why are you so afraid do you still have no faith
5816602 who is this even the wind and the waves obey him
5816603 but i can see you and thats all that matters
5816604 nothing can be clearer or more distinct more unlimited both in application and extent than the plea and urgency of christ
5816605 god i cant feel your presence are you with me
5816606 i can see you and thats all that matters i will never leave you or forsake you you can trust me
5816607 such praying men are always our national benefactors elijah was such he had heard a voice seen a vision tasted a power measured an enemy and with god as partner wrought a victory he knew the mind of god therefore he one man strangled a nation and altered the course of nature by the key of faith which fits every lock elijah locked heaven pocketed the key and made ahab tremble though it is wonderful indeed when god lays hold of a man earth can know one greater wonder when a man lays hold of god
5816608 dont discount what is possible with god philippians 4 13 when god gives an assignment it is no longer an impossibility but rather it is an absolute certainty when god gives you a seemingly impossible task the only thing preventing it from coming to pass is your disobedience how do you respond to assignments that seem impossible do you write them off as unattainable or do you immediately adjust your life to gods revelation watching with anticipation to see how he will accomplish his purposes through your obedience god wants to do the impossible through your life

5816615 iran and the six countries together we must first find an agenda for negotiations then start a negotiation
5816616 during this negotiation i propose that on the one hand the six refrain from referring the issue to the security council and that iran refrain from uranium enrichment during the duration of the negotiation
5816617 the iranians may have an atom bomb within two years the authoritative janes defense weekly warned that was in 1984 two decades ago four years later the world was again put on notice this time by iraq that tehran was at the nuclear threshold and in 1992 the cia foresaw atomic arms in iranian hands by 2000 then u s officials pushed that back to 2003 and in 1997 the israelis confidently predicted a new date 2005
5816618 february 24 1993 cia director james woolsey says that iran is still 8 to 10 years away from being able to produce its own nuclear weapon but with assistance from abroad it could become a nuclear power earlier
5816619 january 1995 the director of the u s arms control and disarmament agency john holum testifies that iran could have the bomb by 2003
5816620 april 29 1996 israeli prime minister shimon peres says he believes that in four years they iran may reach nuclear weapons
5816621 january 17 2000 a new cia assessment on irans nuclear capabilities says that the cia cannot rule out the possibility that iran may possess nuclear weapons the assessment is based on the cias admission that it cannot monitor irans nuclear activities with any precision and hence cannot exclude the prospect that iran may have nuclear weapons

5816858 for about 40 years people have been trying to understand how nitric acid is removed by the hydroxyl radical
5816859 it doesnt really follow what you would normally expect people have been puzzled by that and tried to figure it out
5816860 its a really exciting finding but actually there was a little more to the finding
5816861 what we found had some unusual structural and bonding properties
5816862 in the brave new world of web 2 0 the alpha and beta designations dont mean quite the same things they used to perhaps the most troubling trend is the perpetual beta so many websites stay in perpetual beta its almost become a running joke gmail for example is still in beta after over four years

5816864 the words person human being child and individual include every infant member of the species homo sapiens who is born alive at any stage of development
5816865 caring for fetuses or children who were delivered in this fashion

5816868 had anyone ever suggested to me that somehow that i was going to get some preferential treatment because i was in the u s senate that would have ended the relationship immediately there was no red flag for me that we were getting some special treatment in all of this

5816871 ive done a billion photo shoots but its always with my clothes on
5816872 to think that the whole emphasis was on my underwear but bruno and everyone at the whole shoot made it so comfortable
5816873 i felt nice and relaxed and enjoyed the whole experience
5816874 we need to control him and he will be controlled once he returns to this country

5816890 more than 200 works of art disappeared after the invasion of baghdad in 2003
5816891 two thirds of the monuments had been erected in tribute to military and political figures cherished by saddam his ruling baath party or for the 1980 1988 iran iraq war they are gone forever
5816892 we have put back the statues of al mansur and shahryar in their places and we have restored a modern statue known as the mother
5816893 whenever a new regime arrives destroying the art of the past is in the soul of iraqis it has happened before after the fall of the monarchy and each time there was a revolution

5816896 its about shattered illusions the human world which rusalka yearns so much to be part of has in reality nothing to do with her dreams she encounters such coldness and cruelty and it proves a shock from which she never recovers
5816897 according to east slavic legend the rusalki are the ghosts of women who have committed suicide abandoned mistresses women who have had abortions and who have been burned as witches and who return to avenge their tormentors

5816900 hogans legal arguments are unsupported by case authority and without merit
5816901 here as the party challenging the summonses hogan has the heavy burden of rebutting the governments good faith showing
5816902 naked arguments and bald assertions without evidence in support of such allegations are insufficient to rebut a prima facie case for summons enforcement
5816903 first hogan is wrong because the summonses do not seek tax returns
5816904 second hogan is wrong because resident status is not the test for whether an investigation is unnecessary
5816905 its not to the benefit of anyone to have cases pending for two to three years
5816906 due to the fact that the life of the asylum applicant is at stake the examination of an asylum application is a time consuming procedure
5816907 this factor together with the big number of asylum applications pending needs to be taken into consideration in deciding how many more eligibility officers should be recruited for this highly responsible task
5816908 we try to improve the system but we cannot afford the financial and administrative pressure without the help and the assistance of the european union
5816909 they are better here in security than sleeping in parks
5816910 cyprus i had never heard of it before coming here
5816911 it is very boring here it is a bit like a prison
5816912 it is not easy but it is better here than in the city
5816913 here we have food at every meal and the hospital is near
5816914 a lot of migrants came for economic reaons and are told by traffickers to submit an application for asylum in order to prolong their stay or stay permanently
5816915 the majority of illegal immigrants or asylum seekers who come here enter from the turkish zone and turkey should be made responsible
5816916 we demand support from the european union in order to watch the green line and for pressure to be exercised upon turkey
5816917 we will enact a comprehensive bipartisan employment non discrimination act
5816918 we oppose the defense of marriage act and all attempts to use this issue to divide us
5816919 the public acts records and judicial proceedings of every other state
5816920 obama also believes we need to fully repeal the defense of marriage act and enact legislation that would ensure that the 1 100 federal legal rights and benefits currently provided on the basis of marital status are extended to same sex couples in civil unions and other legally recognized unions
5816921 there are going to be so many things he has promised
5816922 there will be radical actions in his first couple of days if he becomes president
5816923 i dont think that the candidate has given comment as of timing
5816924 so i dont know it will be the first thing in this first administration we do hope it is done in the first 4 years though

5816934 the food tasted better what we are talking about isnt anything new
5816935 look at the increase of sales of organic food in the last decade it has been a double digit rise every year
5816936 i went two years ago it is the concentration of that many people of the same mind set
5816937 i may not know the answer but i can find the answer in a day or two
5816938 raising food that is healthy for consumers and animals does not harm the environment is humane for workers respects animals provides a fair wage to the farmer and supports and enhances rural communities
5816939 this whole globalized food system is playing havoc with the health of human beings the health of the planet the health of the atmosphere
5816940 we have to rein in industrialized globalized food systems and turn it back to the local rhythms of life
5816941 we have to educate people about the whole food industry he said
5816942 that is what we are doing with the community gardens
5816943 our generation needs to do more to inform our children and grandchildren about how life was when we were growing up
5816944 its not like im going but that the community is going

5816950 people in kentucky love to compete in anything and it was a good way to bring people from around the state together to get to know each other a lot of people have formed lasting friendships because of the bluegrass state games
5816951 they werent even playing lacrosse in kentucky when the bluegrass state games started
5816952 its certainly not the same level of exercise as cycling or a 5k run but it encourages people to get off the couch
5816953 and if youve ever gone around the tailgaters at a uk game you know how competitive kentuckians can be at corn hole
5816954 we think were at the right time at the right place with the right product
5816955 it can help bring the state together and make it more healthy at the same time
5816956 if anybody wants to criticize this one earmark let them have at it
5816957 this is something that i think benefits the people of our county of our region and i am very proud to have the opportunity to assist in getting the federal government involved in helping the everyday lives of our citizens
5816958 is what governments about and what government has to do to serve their people
5816959 this has been a serious pollution problem in fayette county and in the region and its something that very desperately needs to be fixed
5816960 unfortunately urban county government has been one of the biggest polluters in our community for too long a time
5816961 south elkhorn station has been the site of more overflows of raw sewage than any other overflow site in our community we just simply have had insufficient capacity to handle the flow during our wet weather periods
5816962 regardless of how long our legal proceedings may take we dont intend for those delays to delay our progress towards improving our environment
5816963 we found theres really no link between smoke free laws and bingo revenues one way or the other
5816964 it would be a win win to include bingo parlors because people who work there to raise money as well as those who go there to play would be protected
5816965 seventy grand ive never heard of any type of house sell for senenty grand
5816966 but seventy grand ive been selling houses for 4 years and never heard of such a ridiculous price
5816967 to correct evasions in the law and to extend it to workplaces to protect more people
5816968 when lexington passed the law four years ago our law was the gold standard
5816969 but now around the country as well as kentucky those laws are more comprehensive than ours meaning they cover all workplaces and have fewer exceptions
5816970 because there is no security measure in place to prevent literal or raw copying access
5816971 control ling access to a work protected under this title
5816972 before you come up with a memorial you really have to think about some of the values
5816973 we decided we needed to have a memorial thats appropriate uplifting serene accessible permanent and enduring
5816974 were trying not to tell the artist what medium to use we dont want to hinder the artists creativity
5816975 the families i know that theyre happy with the pace
5816976 a year ago at this point we thought we were behind and they said they needed a year to get through what they had to get through and then this past year there were issues of litigation and things they were dealing with they asked us to wait until january to have our first meeting this year
5816977 get as much participation and buy in as possible from the families rescue personnel and community as well
5816978 that just seemed like a lasting living memorial and people could take the iris anywhere wherever they were from

5816980 i am hoping that these irises that have been growing next to the pasture of where the plane went down would be accepted as a token of lexington and our thoughts and prayers are with those people who perished that day
5816981 i just think its a nice living piece that could be passed on

5816994 stage separation was slated to occur two minutes and 39 seconds after liftoff as pyrotechnic bolts fired to sever the physical connections between the stages the bolts are all redundantly initiated and have never failed aboard other launch vehicles according to spacex
5816995 we know the lake is liquid because it reflects essentially no light at 5 micron wavelengths it was hard for us to accept the fact that the feature was so black when we first saw it more than 99 9 percent of the light that reaches the lake never gets out again for it to be that dark the surface has to be extremely quiescent mirror smooth no naturally produced solid could be that smooth
5816996 we can see theres a shelf a beach that is being exposed as the lake evaporates

5817004 can clouds predict earthquakes youtube has footage of strange multicoloured clouds seen just before the recent earthquake struck sichuan province in china the first impression is of a rainbow smeared on to small scraps of clouds a phenomenon best known in a circumzenithal halo this is created when sunlight shines through cirrus clouds full of tiny hexagonal ice crystals shaped like plates the crystals behave like glass prisms splitting the light into a bow with the colours of the spectrum often brighter than a rainbow but one puzzle is that the colours in the chinese clouds were upside down from a normal circumzenithal halo red pointing towards the horizon and blue towards the sun instead of the other way round

5817006 the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over
5817007 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it
5817008 my experience is that managers dont know sufficient details about the states of their projects to know which projects are delivering any value at all

5817011 there were 50 of us from dayton and another 50 from columbus and we met in washington
5817012 it was great all of them were world war ii veterans like myself we talked about what outfit we were in and where we served we had something in common
5817013 is a huge undertaking a labor of love it takes some time
5817014 and tears can be seen in the corner of their eyes
5817015 it is really their fault that it took so long to get a world war ii memorial
5817016 that was the last thing on their minds wanting a memorial for what they did
5817017 we came out of the army and we were ready to go
5817018 we all came out with the ability at least we thought we could do it to be in business for ourselves or hold down a good job i did i owe it all to my experience in the army
5817019 we politely return it we want this to be a gift if they are paying for it it is not a gift

5817025 in france the market for tea has increased and darjeeling is the most famous here we have learnt about manufacturing marketing and visited tea gardens
5817026 it was a good experience it will be good for our future
5817027 you take a sip close your eyes and make a wish your wish will come true in 21 days
5817028 we are experiencing history here as these tea estates will not perhaps survive for more than 50 years
5817029 our guests get to see the entire process from plucking to packing which very few places in the world can offer
5817030 it is a great promotional exercise for darjeeling tea as it is a unique experience that tea gardens can offer
5817031 one of my students has set up a successful darjeeling business in france
5817032 he was a wonderful person and a good friend of mine

5817035 we expect airplanes to be less full and skies to be less crowded this labor day holiday
5817036 economic uncertainty and the heavy hit from sky high energy prices mean that many vacation and business travelers are choosing to stay closer to home if they go at all
5817037 on the customer service front airlines have been taking every conceivable step to minimize delays and improve operational efficiencies this focus has resulted in a decline in extended delays this year as compared to a year ago
5817038 customers planning to travel over this holiday have our assurance that we will continue to work to make the travel experience as pleasant as possible
5817039 he left our prison early this morning and he is now already far from here
5817040 i just got the information that hes in ho chi minh city
5817041 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
5817042 i was just shaking and and then also immediately i had to go into
5817043 immediately made those appointments and immediately called around for someone to start teaching me how to live macrobiotically
5817044 its going to be really exciting because its truly one of the most amazing experiences to come to your part of the world
5817045 one of the things that weve done in the past is to send our percussion students out to work in improvisation workshops
5817046 this to me is the ultimate event where east and west are coming together for three weeks
5817047 its natural i would want to be in the middle of it
5817048 these are all people ive never met in my life but they treat me like im an old friend
5817049 thats the one that really blew peoples minds because heres this guy we remember from last year and all of a sudden his accent is gone and hes doing this art form
5817050 americans go overseas and they see the way people see them is very different from the way americans see themselves its the same thing with the chinese
5817051 its wrong and shocking that some doctors felt their religious beliefs allowed them to ignore the law and discriminate
5817052 this isnt just a win for me personally and for other lesbian women its a win for everyone
5817053 for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it
5817054 not everybody can go on the cover of playboy i did it because i am confident of my body and myself it wasnt a group decision we havent seen each other the shooting was separate everyone decided it for themselves
5817055 were used to it whether domestically or internationally we have dancing girls with us
5817056 kind of dark and moody like the work ive been involved in
5817057 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5817058 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5817059 we had a 19 hour plane ride from new york and wed already decided when we got here that we needed a rickshaw
5817060 we found a small rickshaw in a shop and were studying how to make one for a jump but when we had our first meeting in beijing we were told that was the old china and it was not the way they wanted their country portrayed
5817061 some that are very bright like the chinese umbrellas dont need colourful gardens but the bridge allowed me to do a beautiful chinese garden
5817062 it is considered too sexy for us its not good for viewers in malaysia
5817063 we dont want our people our teenagers influenced by their performance we want clean artists artists that are good role models
5817064 for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it
5817065 not everybody can go on the cover of playboy i did it because i am confident of my body and myself it wasnt a group decision we havent seen each other the shooting was separate everyone decided it for themselves
5817066 shes thoughtful and not the least bit full of herself
5817067 were used to it whether domestically or internationally we have dancing girls with us
5817068 my motivation for making this public is my desire for a presidential candidate to be honest i didnt want the sex thing to come out but i think it is important for the candidate to be honest about his drug use as late as 1999
5817069 so many things are covered in this handbook but i have to say my favourite is where she explains
5817070 once you have the perk to take it away is seen as a violation of a psychological contract you have with your employee
5817071 i put it in our annual report in the tiniest type i could find
5817072 boards were pushing back on some of these perks because they thought they didnt look good
5817073 but i think that passed and now the issue is whether these practices are important in recruiting and retaining people if the economy softens there will be push back again we did see that when the economy softened in 2001
5817074 if you are taking anything away from employees its important to explain the need for doing it
5817075 it helps a lot if the need is something driven by factors outside the firm the need to improve share price isnt going to satisfy a lot of people
5817076 i do not recommend taking away perks but if a company has to management needs to remember that taking things away from people almost always leads to feelings of unfairness
5817077 if management does such a thing it has to be very sure to explain very very clearly why it was necessary in a way that seems fair to the employees
5817078 its hard to say they were deliberately trying to exclude people at lower levels
5817079 it seems to me that the emphasis was on quality and wanting to provide an excellent opportunity for employees it just came at a higher cost
5817080 we found that while perks have this perception that they are excess our results showed that while there may be excess at the extremes on average there seems to be evidence that firms offer perks to enhance the productivity of executives
5817081 many of those spouses dont view it as a vacation
5817082 there are a lot of what the sec calls perks that frankly the person receiving them would say thanks for nothing
5817083 you see big numbers related to security systems but the individual would probably say id rather have the cash thank you
5817084 just because of the emotional connection he or she has to the perk theres an alchemy to choosing the right perks
5817085 in the old days the management team was made up of older white men who all wanted the same thing
5817086 now some people with young kids value supplemental child care over membership at the club
5817087 often you have to keep these deals quiet so others dont feel their own deal is bad
5817088 we have seen an expansion into voluntary benefits as the costs of health care and traditional benefits are rising employers are looking to provide at no cost to them something thats perceived of as valuable to the employee
5817089 it is worth considering the extent that employees trade pay for perks
5817090 absent tax benefits employees may prefer cash to perks and may be willing to take a dollar reduction of perks for a less than dollar increase in pay
5817091 perks are not the only thing companies need to make it
5817092 the front line managers typically have wanted more direct control over the employees and dont like centrally imposed perks and ways of managing
5817093 and they dont see the need to have these perks when the economy is going down and people arent quitting anyway
5817094 after years of continual mismanagement in the knox county judges office we are encouraged by the current judges willingness to adopt our recommendations and improve oversight of his office for the benefit of the taxpayers of knox county

5817180 i have the support of at least one of the owners i sent e mails to all of them but he was clear we had the money
5817181 if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money we have to make the right decision in terms of who we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager
5817182 would you like to put your hand in my pockets and see if you find anything
5817183 a customer came up to me and said they saw you putting stuff in your pockets and i dont want to see you get in trouble
5817184 we want to concentrate on winning and the best news for our supporters is to win games
5817185 in the first half they were attacking the second half we were on top and attacking and continued until the end
5817186 we had chances torres is a key player and he can change games for the team its really important to have these sorts of players
5817187 we tired in the last 15 to 20 minutes which is something i should take responsibility for we should have had some tougher games in pre season
5817188 i know liverpool have only had one game in europe but it was a tough game we tired and i think that probably affected our decision making
5817189 for all the hard work the number of goals scored in the last 15 minutes is huge and the other 75 minutes goes out of the window
5817190 it was just one moment thats all were talking about but thats the beauty of the premier league i cant complain because ive been on the other side of it
5817191 it will be a difficult match but i think well play much better than them
5817192 we will not make any mistake against them or we may pay for that
5817193 we lost 0 3 in the copa america final now there are some different players in the argentine team but we still have four or five players who played that match in the team now
5817194 well watch their video later and try to study them
5817195 my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
5817196 my family and myself are very thankful to the club the fans and the city and we will never give up fighting to get the best for liverpool
5817197 i dont read headlines on the day of the game but my commitment is 100 with the fans with the players and with the club in general i say 100 times my family is happy here we want to win trophies at this club because it is a massive club
5817198 if we have problems because we are not doing things which in my opinion as a manager we could do i will work as hard as i can for the club
5817199 i will not talk about any player but in april i was talking about this behind the scenes
5817200 we tried to do things in confidentiality but sometimes you cannot and you need to explain before the end of the transfer window if the manager has an idea and it is not a question of money then we have to make the right decisions in terms of whom we bring in that has to be the decision of the manager
5817201 i thought this four years ago and i think it now if you are quicker it is easier to sign the target you have
5817202 i was in contact with tom hicks and he told me we had the money we have sold players for more than 20million in the summer and he told me if you sell players you can buy with that too
5817203 i have the support of at least one of the owners i sent emails to all of them but he hicks was clear we had the money
5817204 it is not something that i can explain you have to analyse it but to me it is clear they were supporting me if we had money and we do have money
5817205 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation
5817206 everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
5817207 but in this case i want to be very clear
5817208 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
5817209 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal if you want to talk about these players you must talk to the chief executive of our club who was handling the discussions
5817210 if you want to talk about players then you talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then you talk with me
5817211 the squad is better but we now have problems on the left because we have lost john arne riise harry kewell and sebastian leto we will see what happens in the future with that situation but clearly our squad is better
5817212 those tires 200 there goes the hose i just replaced 240 oh and 40 in fuel

5817216 maybe i should have never broken it off with from so many years ago i could have used his car right now
5817217 i dont know why but i feel homeless right now

5817221 give a man a fish and you feed him for a day teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime
5817222 i havent got a clue to be honest with you i havent played many games recently so i honestly cant say
5817223 there is a big squad there and everyone is fighting for their place and i just have to train well and take the chance if i get it
5817224 i havent played but i will just wait and see and when the transfer window closes we will know then
5817225 i will wait and see if i can get into the team if not then obviously i want to play so we will just have to take it from there
5817226 we have spoken about it but at this time i dont think i will say too much more
5817227 it was a good finish from fernando i was just behind the shot and i could see exactly where it was going it was a great strike and it gave the keeper no chance
5817228 the most important thing is that we got the win we have had pre season and that was our first game in the league so it was good to get three points on the board and keep a clean sheet
5817229 we have to be happy with that but we have to look at what we can do better because there are many many things that we can do better
5817230 the next game is at home against middlesbrough on saturday so hopefully we will do a lot better then
5817231 it was tough for us at the start of the game they came out of the blocks really quickly and set a really high tempo which youd expect because it was their first home game of the season
5817232 they put us under a lot of pressure and maybe we were a little bit slow to get going
5817233 everybody has been talking and it is clear that i am being blamed for everything global warming rises in petrol prices everything
5817234 in this case i want to be clear since i talked with martin oneill in april i havent talked with anyone else at aston villa all the talks have been between rick parry and the owner and chief executive of aston villa and they have been pretty good
5817235 if someone wants to talk about barry in the future they will have to talk to the owner or chief executive of aston villa or rick parry i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal
5817236 i just want to clarify because every time people say oh you were doing this i talked to martin oneill in april and after this i was not in charge
5817237 i talked just with martin oneill i havent had any contact with the owner or the chief executive of aston villa i havent talked with martin oneill since april
5817238 if you want to talk about players talk to rick parry if you want to talk about football then talk to me
5817239 we do have some problems on the left because we have lost john arne riise harry kewell and sebastian leto
5817240 i think we need something on the left but anyway i will continue to try and improve and progress with the players that i have
5817241 i want to be clear i dont have any problem any problem with the owners so i am not talking about anything like this its just that i will try to improve the squad
5817242 we have players in mind i dont think it will be a problem to find players
5817243 the question is to find the right players for us the right left footed players for us i was in contact with the owners and they told me that we had some money i think enough to get the player we want its not a problem i feel we can progress
5817244 it will be a difficult match but i think well play much better than them
5817245 we will not make any mistake against them or we may pay for that
5817246 we lost 0 3 in the copa america final now there are some different players in the argentine team but we still have four or five players who played that match in the team now
5817247 when i was first talking with xabi about a transfer we needed money after these months it is not a question of money we would have to have a massive offer because alonso is a great player
5817248 but if we sell one or two players we have enough money to bring in one more good player
5817249 dont forget we will need eight british players and the left footer we were talking about can play in three positions too
5817250 the thing is ive heard rafa benitez saying keane can play anywhere left side or right side if he plays robbie on the left or right then hes not going to get the best out of him
5817251 to get the best out of robbie is to play him down the centre with torres if benitez does he will get the best out of the partnership
5817252 robbie and torres are both intelligent players torres makes great runs and robbie has played with dimitar berbatov and a lot of players so he knows where to go and where not to go
5817253 our focus is on the premier league and we know how important it is to win the premier league for the fans
5817254 it has been too many years and we are focusing on that it was important to start with a win after the not so very good game in the champions league
5817255 i always want to play with a good player like robbie and he is fine for me and the team which is more important

5817271 im back in training and feel 100 per cent so ill be ready for the start of the season at sunderland
5817272 it was really important for me to be involved in the pre season training camp in switzerland and i worked hard unfortunately another small problem kept me out when i got a kick on my shin which caused some inflammation but im now looking forward to the start of the season
5817273 it will be the managers decision whether i will be involved against sunderland i hope to do a good job and help the team make a good start to the season
5817274 now is the time when the results have to come and we are ready for the start of the season
5817275 we know that sunderland has improved their squad a lot during the summer and they are a strong team now
5817276 we have also improved by bringing in some quality players so we know that even the team isnt 100 per cent yet we hope to start well and get the three points we have a strong squad and we want to fight for the title this year
5817277 its really good to have competition and i think the boss is really pleased about that
5817278 he has a very good opportunity to change the system and use different players so everyone will be fighting for their place i think that is very good for the team
5817279 in every position we have two or three players so i think its very important during every training session that we all keep working hard and keep up our level

5817293 the first half in particular was not good enough we know that
5817294 it was tough for us at the start of the game they came out of the blocks really quickly and set a really high tempo which youd expect because it was their first home game of the season
5817295 they put us under a lot of pressure and maybe we were a little bit slow to get going
5817296 it was certainly not the best game we have played but the important thing was that we got better in the second half and at the end fernando popped up with a goal and that was enough to win the game
5817297 the most important thing is that we got the win we have had pre season and that was our first game in the league so it was good to get three points on the board and keep a clean sheet

5817360 josh do you know that mooses marauders paid 34 for you and your eras tim lincecum sometimes looks like a little leaguer out there with his floppy delivery and he did a little leaguer like move move by pitching exclusively from the stretch from the sixth inning
5817361 this is a fairly remarkable streak when the guys are all playing well like this you have this feeling that you can always come back we definitely feel like were going to win when its close in the seventh
5817362 when weve won weve always pitched well when youre playing like were playing you start to feel a little invincible
5817363 berkman is one of the best hitters in the national league
5817364 his numbers speak for themselves when i got him out two nights ago i went away from him and with fastballs in
5817365 today i went away from him but i figured i would try to go in on him again and he was sitting on it i just caught too much of the plate and he hit it pretty good
5817366 we couldnt get anyone hot out there thats what it comes down to we got the lead we did what we wanted to do out there
5817367 he hinshaw made a mistake he threw one right down the middle which is not what we want him to do in that situation the guy berkman is a great hitter he shouldnt have gotten a pitch like that but he did
5817368 to have your number retired its one of the greatest things that could ever happen to you
5817369 i knew the significance of it so i was nervous i havent been this nervous in a long time
5817370 i played the game i dearly loved to play since i was a kid
5817371 they gave me a number and now its hanging from the rafters
5817372 we sat next to each other for so many years we had a great ride
5817373 the next time itll be 2013 when youre a first ballot hall of famer
5817374 he snyder told me he had some friends sitting behind home plate watching the game for some reason i really wanted to hit a home run
5817375 i didnt have location its very difficult for me if i cant throw the ball where i want to
5817376 so we got through the second and we thought ok here we go
5817377 it feels good you cant lie having a night like that in front of family and friends
5817378 coming home is great but thats icing on the cake right there
5817379 there are certainly things that didnt end up the way id have liked them to
5817380 im happy to be here for me ive got plenty of incentive every time i take the field its tough to add to that
5817381 adams presence in the lineup takes pressure off a lot of guys makes our lineup deeper
5817382 whenever i play ill do my best and ill be ready whenever they put me in
5817383 when you add somebody like that it gives the entire offense a push
5817384 whatever role you give him hes ready to go out there and handle it
5817385 it was the same as chicago its frustrating a lot of the time i wasnt missing by much
5817386 i was just trying to squeeze brandon through the sixth inning
5817387 i was just trying to get him to get one more guy out but it didnt happen
5817388 it was definitely wild but well take it giants pitcher barry zito was doing really well unfortunately for him at the end things went bad and we just kind of got in the way of some balls
5817389 ive never seen anything like it but ill take it
5817390 thats the sign of a good team taking advantage of your opportunities
5817391 zito was locked in it started with the bang bang play at first mix in a walk a blooper and then he just got out of rhythm and couldnt make a pitch
5817392 then we cant hit two batters with the bases loaded
5817393 im most upset with the walk to loretta and hitting quintero
5817394 those were the difference makers its my job to come back and attack loretta you cant do anything about bloop hits and sacrifice flies its on me for walking loretta thats the difference maker
5817395 obviously you start the game off and youre down by one or two runs all of a sudden youre backs against the wall you want to steer clear of it
5817396 it wasnt like they hit him hard anytime you throw the way he did its a tough one to lose
5817397 games like this are what i need to get past the previous start
5817398 not only did i pitch well i pitched well in a game i needed to
5817399 its not like i got a whole lot of action either
5817400 its hard to throw better than he did tonight he had good command he located very well he had good stuff
5817401 you saw two of the best pitchers ever out there randy pitched a great game too he just made one mistake
5817402 they were hitting it pretty well but i got them to hit it right at someone
5817403 i think randy was more focused because he was facing roy randy was pretty dominant and roy was real dominant
5817404 i mean any time that guy puts wood on it its a base hit right now
5817405 you kind of knew after the first two games to see that kind of a performance three times wouldve been a lot to ask for
5817406 there are a few small breakdowns in the right lane on the mass pike stay to the left
5817407 wow that was a pretty significant accident and it makes sense why i sat here for so damn long
5817408 i like to hit but i think since ive been here the more i hit the worse ive been getting
5817409 i guess theyre going to hitch their wagon to him and just ride him off into the sunset
5817410 i was just looking for something out over the plate trying to put a good swing on it put it in play
5817411 he threw me a curveball and i was able to flip it to left
5817412 ive got to tip my cap because it was a slider down and away it looked at the video 100 times and ill probably see it 100 times when im not sleeping tonight he really helped himself out there its frustrating when something like that happens
5817413 it was a little awkward but i was just trying to get in scoring position
5817414 i always knew he was a good athlete but most pitchers lets be honest cant hit
5817415 he can swing the bat a little bit i just wish i could have hit some home runs in front of him instead of making him run like that
5817416 we just cant let them get away with us right there
5817417 and they got away the five runs is really unacceptable we cant let that happen there
5817418 hes definitely confident in his hitting abilities and for the right a good hitter
5817419 i guess theyre going to hitch their wagon to him and just ride him off into the sunset
5817420 i always knew he was a good athlete but most pitchers lets be honest cant hit he can swing the bat a little bit i just wish i could have hit some home runs in front of him instead of making him run like that
5817421 i was just looking for something out over the plate trying to put a good swing on it put it in play

5817425 i like to hit but i think since ive been here the more i hit the worse ive been getting
5817426 hes definitely confident in his hitting abilities and for the right a good hitter
5817427 thats hard to do were just trying to pick up the slack it was a good day all the way around
5817428 everything i threw was right over the middle of the plate early on especially in the first inning they were sitting on my slider thats definitely not the way i wanted to come back
5817429 its like a broken record getting behind by a lot early
5817430 i cant remember a clean 1 2 3 first inning its been a while it makes for a long day and a long week
5817431 you get behind and you get the ball up and theyre whacking it
5817432 bonds is not a fit for us if he would come i would go i wouldnt want to deal with it
5817433 it didnt look good he carried us the last month and a half its a big hole to fill but were capable of filling it im just now starting to suck it up
5817434 man that guy knows how to drive in those runs doesnt he
5817435 you hate to see those guys come up in those situations theyre rbi machines
5817436 i was playing in a little bit trying to stop the bleeding with a runner on second base
5817437 it mightve been tailing away a little bit it was close thats all i had there was nothing else left in the tank i was at full speed
5817438 over the last couple of months i dont think theres been a better player in the league not just hitting but fielding too

5817543 prevention strategies often focus on modifiable risk factors for colonization and aspiration and can successfully reduce ventilator associated pneumonia rates but no single strategy completely eliminates ventilator associated pneumonia
5817544 adherence to prevention guidelines is variable due to costs and lack of education resources and leadership
5817545 in conclusion the results of this large randomized multicenter study demonstrated that the silver coated endotracheal tube significantly reduced the incidence of microbiologically confirmed ventilator associated pneumonia and had its greatest benefit during the peak time of ventilator associated pneumonia occurrence without any notable adverse events
5817546 the silver coated endotracheal tube appears to offer a unique approach because it is the first intervention that becomes user dependent after intubation requiring no further action by the clinician
5817547 based on the results of this trial should clinicians reconsider guidelines for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and use a silver coated endotracheal tube in all patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation in the icu
5817548 silver coated endotracheal tubes not definitive solution but could benefit high risk patients
5817549 the answer is probably yes for the subset of patients at very high risk of developing early onset ventilator associated pneumonia such as neurologically impaired patients or trauma patients because the greatest effect of the intervention appeared to occur during the first 10 days of mechanical ventilation and was clinically relevant with minimal effect on clinician workload
5817550 important uncertainties exist regarding the exact benefit of silver coated endotracheal tubes consequently silver coated tubes should not be viewed as the definitive answer for ventilator associated pneumonia prevention and until additional data confirm the clinical effectiveness and cost benefit of these devices their issue should be restricted to high risk patients treated in icus with benchmark value based infection rates that remain above institutional goals despite implementation of a comprehensive strategy of usual preventive measures to prevent ventilator associated pneumonia

5817585 in a bit of historical revisionism swift boat veterans for truth founder and unfit for command co author john oneill distorted jerome corsis role in co authoring the book
5817586 simply an editor and not really any sort of co author
5817587 unfit book materials show corsi more than just an editor
5817588 one of the authors of a new anti john kerry book frequently posted comments on a conservative web site describing muslims and catholics as pedophiles and pope john paul ii as senile in chat room entry last year on freerepublic com corsi writes islam is a peaceful religion just as long as the women are beaten the boys buggered and the infidels are killed in another entry he says so this is what the last days of the catholic church are going to look like buggering boys undermines the moral base and the lawyers rip the gold off the vatican altars we may get one more pope when this senile one dies but thats probably about it

5817592 yesterday jerome corsi was prattling on about the north american union again after michael medved deservedly spanked him for spreading conspiracy theories while i dont think corsi is any more worthy of being taken seriously than those who think jews rule the world or the truthers who think president bush is responsible for 9 11 i thought i would respond to him one last time i think thats about the fourth time ive said that now why respond again whats the point well unfortunately a lot of conservatives consider this conspiracy theory to be so preposterous that they believe its beneath them to even bother discussing it and that leaves corsi and his ilk to dominate the debate and since there are a lot of conservatives being taken in by this north american union nonsense somebody has got to step up to the plate
5817593 i guess there are people who believe in the plan for a north american union but there are people who believe in bigfoot
5817594 all his life jerome corsis been told that were running out of oil
5817595 i remember driving with my dad in a 1952 plymouth and listening to him talk about the end of oil
5817596 im at the point where the dinosaur theory seems silly
5817597 you take a pile of cats and you bury them dig them up 10 years later and you dont get oil
5817598 the truth is that there is so much oil around the world that its been easy to find

5817637 we find there is even uncertainty whether stanley ann and obama senior were ever married in a church
5817638 on feb 2 1961 several months after they met obamas parents got married in maui according to divorce records
5817639 other sources say divorce papers confirm that a civil ceremony was held on maui on february 2 1961 when ann was three months pregnant with obama
5817640 senator obama could claim to be a citizen of kenya as well as of the united states obama can trace his heritage back to his mother who was born in the united states and was an american citizen when he was born and to his father who was born in kenya and was a kenyan citizen when obama was born

5817659 fa o um apelo para o torcedor o ipatinga tem nove jogos em casa e espero que o torcedor v ao campo contra o fluminense est vamos em desvantagem e na hora que ela torcida apoiou o ipatinga virou o jogo contra o internacional a torcida apoiou e vencemos o jogo contra o cruzeiro os torcedores incentivaram e conseguimos fazer 2 a 0 mas por infelicidade o cruzeiro empatou
5817660 mesmo quando o time advers rio n o est bem a torcida os empurra e eles conseguem a vit ria durante os 90 minutos a nossa torcida deve empurrar o time ao t rmino da partida se o ipatinga n o tiver vencido que vaiem mas durante o jogo o time precisa do incentivo do torcedor
5817661 o objetivo sempre vencer o pr ximo jogo cada jogo s o tr s pontos n o adianta pensar de outra forma s vezes temos um advers rio direto e o resultado pode ajudar mais mas toda rodada tem o mesmo valor
5817662 estou disposi o o treino foi muito bom n o senti dor nenhuma at quarta feira vou estar me sentindo ainda melhor

5817666 eu estava nervoso com as m os e os p s formingando quando ainda estava na baliza ficava mexendo a minha m o pois com ela formingando eu n o iria conseguir puxar a gua

5817684 hopefully it will help the people who run charter schools to take a step back and determine if they have these elements in their schools and if not try to bring them into their schools
5817685 if it helps people rededicate themselves to why they got into the charter business in the first place hopefully to make a difference for the students education then this report will do it
5817686 we are happy to receive recognition but happier to hear one of our children was the number 1 student in norths north high schools international baccalaureate program and is getting into cornell
5817687 were working on how we can take what we learned and implement it for every single kid in every single charter school
5817688 charter schools in arizona can be a critical part of that revival

5817696 what if congress had responded to watergate by immunizing the executive branchs lawbreakers and giving richard nixon sweeping new powers to snoop
5817697 oh wait they just did they just took thirty years or so to get around to it
5817698 it really is a black mark not only on the democrats but on the congress and really the history of our country and the same thing rachel happened with regard to the patriot act when we tried to fix it after it had been passed in a flawed way there was this period of strength where democrats held firm and then they collapsed and the same thing happened again here this administration despite its weakness somehow is able to raise the specter of being as they say soft on terrorism and unfortunately democrats who can be so strong on domestic issues somehow collapse and thats exactly what happened this is a terrible piece of legislation its one of the greatest assaults on the constitution i think in the history of our country we are going to have to fix it but it is a dark hour for the constitution
5817699 in particular barack obama should allow us to greatly change this mistake
5817700 hes a constitutional scholar i believe that he will have a better chance to look at these powers that have been given to the executive branch even though hell be running the executive branch i think he will understand and help take the lead in fixing some of the worst provisions
5817701 i do think that people have a right to be disappointed
5817702 but they also have a right to hope for change on this issue in particular starting in january
5817703 it is heartening to hear your optimism on the prospect of obamas presidency on this issue
5817704 but of course his vote today let a lot of us who see this as a real abrogation of the fourth amendment to be very concerned
5817705 well probably continue to go back until the mission is over

5817721 zum einen ist bereits ziemlich fragw rdig wie man darauf kommt da das oberste gericht eines angeblich nicht existierenden oder nicht souver nen staates denn 1973 war die bundesrepublik schlie lich noch existent nur eben laut
5817722 das gg ist bewu t als dauerprovisorium angelegt denn eine verfassung die der souver n das deutsche volk frei abgestimmt h tte in einer volksabstimmung w rde praktisch das deutsche reich wiederherstellen
5817723 wer einem anderen in seinen rechten dadurch absichtlich einen schaden zuf gt da er ihn oder einen dritten durch t uschung ber tatsachen zu einer handlung duldung oder unterlassung verleitet die den schaden herbeif hrt ist mit freiheitsstrafe bis zu einem jahr zu bestrafen
5817724 und es wirkt wie der staat brd egal ob ihresgleichen dem das abstreitet und sich dabei vergn glich ber die omf auf die schenkel klopft
5817725 jedes volk land staat hat eine grundordnung ob man die nun verfassung nennt ist schnurzegal das ist lediglich eine kommunikations angelegenheit es soll sogar l nder geben die ohne eine schriftlich ausgefertigte verfassung auskommen seit langem und es d rfte genug l nder geben wo die grundordnung von oben gegeben wurde
5817726 bez glich des gg der brd nun ist zu sagen da es als text verdienstvoller deutscher patriotischer politiker
5817727 ohne ns bindung zwar unter aufsicht der westlichen siegerbesatzer von 1945 in 1949 zustandekam
5817728 und nicht vom gesamten staatsvolk der westdeutschen zone brd abgestimmt wurde aber immerhin wurde es bis auf das ablehnende bayern von den unter verbot der nsdap demokratisch zuvor gew hlten landtagen der anderen bundesl nder der brd angenommen welche aus halbwegs freien mehr gibt es nie wahlen hervorgegangen waren
5817729 es gibt eben selten was ideales so auch bei politik und demokratie
5817730 immerhin ist das gg der brd das im allgemeinen sprachgebrauch oft auch als verfassung benannt wird der vom deutschen volke in 1919 per volksabstimmung verabschiedeten weimarer verfassung sehr hnlich formal und in der wertegrundlage
5817731 das ist eine glatte an zynismus kaum zu berbietende l ge carlo schmid et al haben das gg im auftrag der besatzer entworfen die es dann genehmigt haben das wissen sie doch oder
5817732 so allm hlich wird das etwas l stig und erm dend mit ihnen
5817733 sie glauben doch nicht im ernst da wir ihnen sachen abkaufen nur weil sie in ihrer kontrafaktizit t politisch korrekt sind
5817734 in der ashkenasi j dischen und in der t rkischen bev lkerung sind mit einer von 1 000 personen relativ betrachtet deutlich mehr menschen von morbus gaucher sprich goschee betroffen das gen tritt etwa bei 2 der weltbev lkerung jedoch bei 7 der ashkenasi j dischen bev lkerung auf
5817735 was nicht n tig ist da jeder au er rechtsextremisten das grundgesetz als verfassung anerkennt
5817736 1984 mit napoleon und den schafen die ihm alles nachbl kten
5817737 das ist eine glatte an zynismus kaum zu berbietende l ge carlo schmid et al haben das gg im auftrag der besatzer entworfen die es dann genehmigt haben das wissen sie doch oder
5817738 da w rde mich aber mal eine erhebung dazu interessieren und zwar eine einigermassen glaubw rdige
5817739 wenn du diese diskussion mitbekommen hast wirst du sicherlich verstehen warum die v lker denen man abzustimmen erlaubt hat ber die eu verfassung eine ganz andere meinung u ern als ihre volks
5817740 ich sprach n mlich ber den aspekt des v lkerrechts da es keinen friedensvertrag mit deutschland gibt
5817741 eine angebliche nichtexistenz eines friedensvertrages die in rechtsextremen kreisen postuliert wird ist ein mythos mit einem sehr laaaangen bart und tausendfach widerlegt
5817742 in etwa das gleiche wie von ihren politisch korrekten beitr gen hier
5817743 jeder der an den wahlen des bundesrepublik teilnimmt akzeptiert das grundgesetz oder wollen sie dies leugnen
5817744 widerling aug 18 2008 at 20 00 tyr 26 du mi verstehst mich was ich meine hat holmes 19 sehr treffend ausgedr ckt es ist was anderes ob das volk selbst ber eine verfassung abstimmt oder ob volksvertreter ohne imperatives mandat nach eigenem gutd nken eine verfassung beschlie en wollen
5817745 habe von so einem test jetzt hier das erste mal gelesen ist doch totaler schwachsinn oder
5817746 8 5 1945 kapitulation des deutschen reiches ende des 2 weltkrieges
5817747 jeder der an den wahlen des bundesrepublik teilnimmt akzeptiert das grundgesetz oder wollen sie dies leugnen
5817748 dass das grundgesetz alle kriterien des materiellen verfassungsbegfriffes erf lle

5817751 die bildung eines oder mehrerer staaten auf bereits bestehendem staatsgebiet ist v lkerrechtlich nicht m glich
5817752 ob das deutsche volk nicht zu verwechseln mit der gesellschaft nun dran glaubt oder nicht die mehrheit glaubt ohnehin aus reiner bequemlichkeit bzw glaubt mal eben gar nichts ebenso hat die masse auch nicht die rettenden ideen die gro en politischen leistungen waren immer nur das ergebnis ganz weniger genialer idealisten
5817753 aber wenn erstmal das schicke auto weg ist die teuren klamotten l chrig werden die letzte kreditkarte eingezogen wurde und schlie lich der hunger das volk am schlafen hindert dann wird kaum noch einer diskutieren k nnen und wie wir in aller gem tlichkeit vom thema abschweifen denn dann endlich besinnt man sich auf das naturgesetz des daseinskampfes
5817754 fazit wir sind mit so vielen kleinigkeiten besch ftigt die uns vom gro en abhalten das system funktioniert also noch

5817760 brigens zum staastrecht hat carlo schmid in seiner rede zum gg vor dem parlamentarischen rat 1948 schon alles gesagt was zu sagen war und ist
5817761 deutschland braucht nicht neu geschaffen zu werden es mu aber neu organisiert werden
5817762 zum mindesten auf bestimmten sachgebieten durch die besatzungsm chte durch den kontrollrat im ganzen und durch die milit rbefehlshaber in den einzelnen zonen ausge bt durch diese treuh nderschaft von oben wird der zusammenhang aufrechterhalten die hoheitsgewalt in deutschland ist also nicht untergegangen sie hat lediglich den tr ger gewechselt indem sie in treuh nderschaft bergegangen ist
5817763 die bundesrepublik deutschland sei so das bverfg nicht rechtsnachfolger des deutschen reiches sondern mit ihm identisch vor der wiedervereinigung allerdings nur teilidentisch aus dieser teilidentit t wurde abgeleitet dass der bundesrepublik die rechtsmacht zu verf gungen fehle die deutschland als ganzes betreffen insbesondere die endg ltige regelung der deutschen ostgrenze anerkennung der oder neisse linie abtretung ostpreu ens an die sowjetunion bzw an polen w re eine solche verf gung gewesen es war darum rechtlich konsequent dass sich die bundesregierung im jahr 1990 zu einer regelung dieser fragen erst nach und nicht schon vor der wiedervereinigung bereitgefunden hat denn mit dem beitritt der ddr und dem ende des sonderstatus von berlin h rte die bundesrepublik deutschland auf im verh ltnis zum deutschen reich nur teil identisch zu sein seitdem ist sie vielmehr mit dem deutschen reich voll identisch und besitzt die rechtsmacht zu verf gungen die deutschland als ganzes etwa sein staatsgebiet betreffen
5817764 im brigen wie oft wird in diesem dichtbesiedelten land der kampfmittelr umdienst gerufen und ich erinnere an eine autobahnbaustelle in sachsen in der im letzten jahr ein arbeiter durch eine englische fliegerbombe ums leben kam

5817775 maybe investors were hoping to shrug off the challenges of high commodity prices and inflation
5817776 but now we find out that perhaps the inflation situation is worse than we thought
5817777 coupling the two you have slow growth with higher inflation
5817778 any time you are in the hospital its got to be pretty serious
5817779 the name of the stadium was changed to red bull arena to be more in line with other red bull properties worldwide
5817780 over the course of the construction process the naming was not controlled by red bull since red bull took over complete control of the construction of the stadium last november we have been planning to make a change more in line with other red bull properties red bull arena will be the benchmark in the north american soccer stadium landscape by which all other venues will be measured

5817807 our inflation figures are way above that but what it tells us is that the productive base of the economy has really shrunk
5817808 we really need to change the way we do business

5817813 soccer has a remarkable ability to bring people together and break down social and cultural barriers sport also helps with the development of good physical and mental health promotes team work and helps to build self confidence in individuals which is why the government actively supports initiatives like community street soccer

5817819 i remember the birmingham game and what happened to eduardo the lads were winning 2 1 but then in the last minute gael gave away a really stupid penalty
5817820 there were an awful lot of other similarly negative things happening everything began with eduardos injury then came gaels error and that thing with william
5817821 you could say that was probably where the ground started to crumble beneath our feet
5817822 he played brilliantly all season he improved immensely and turned into a great defender as a result but he messed up that day
5817823 it was not an easy situation on the other hand it was williams first season as captain and its not easy to wear the armband in a team like this
5817824 i think he will have learned there were things he could have done better but he knows that better than anyone else
5817825 hes really immersed in everything and that was something he just got immersed in too deeply but otherwise hes a good leader in my opinion and he will continue to be captain even though there was speculation about that

5817833 the new facility provides very attractive economics relative to the market a 3 year renewable lease and is expected to continue to reduce on going overhead expenses for facility operation which we believe will allow a greater share of financial resources to be devoted to program and business development

5817893 weve seen a flat to declining sales line in hispanic markets for some time and our spanish ads were only speaking to customers we already have
5817894 that was a great example of taking a slice of life from a husband and wife no matter the culture and pushing the ad into entertainment
5817895 not only are americans comfortable with positive stereotyping as a means to be politically correct but so are many hispanics

5817905 and all of a sudden he says how old is he
5817906 i want the burden of clearing this up to be on the agencies that are the holders of responsibilities the department of homeland security and the attorney general of the united states
5817907 we told the airlines we would allow them if someone gave a birth date to exclude that person from the list
5817908 let the person get their boarding pass directly at home or at the kiosk just like everyone else some airlines have done this some have chosen not to because they dont want to spend the money
5817909 and their attitude is well tsa gets the blame for it so i guess if they can do what they are doing now with food and can charge you for it but i hate to suggest that i may give them an idea
5817910 we are now awaiting tsas announced january 2009 implementation of the secure flight program which is expected to reduce the number of misidentified passengers
5817911 in the meantime the airlines worked collaboratively with tsa to further minimize unnecessary passenger inconvenience a key part of that short term solution relies on frequent flier program enrollment to help resolve misidentification issues and as a result we are urging passengers to enroll
5817912 it came in through all three doors that i have
5817913 she never ever had the intent to cause any harm to anybody
5817914 she feels horrible about giving them false hopes that their daughter was still alive
5817915 it was more of a way of life for her it was surviving her life it was trying to move past esther reed and who she was in reality
5817916 she has a lot of things in her background and a lot of bad family relationships that she was trying to get away from
5817917 were glad to see this case to this resolution i hope this gives the family some sort of resolution

5817925 the european championship has been put behind us we have to play offensively with a lot of pace
5817926 it is really sad both for him for inter and for us
5817927 you can call it a 3 5 2 at the start where we have three defenders in the first part of the defensive play
5817928 we hope it will improve our defensive play and save running distance for our midfielders and forwards power that they can use offensively when we gain the ball
5817929 there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real
5817930 we wouldnt know what we were doing if we did
5817931 a break appeared up near the feet area as the team and i began examining this area near the feet i observed the foot which looked unnatural reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot

5817939 the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward justice
5817940 for other people to say things like that people wouldnt take it seriously but with barack people really did take him seriously they thought of him as someone who really sincerely believed it
5817941 remember at the time in chicago the wards were really politically motivated
5817942 if you werent onboard with the political process and people in leadership then your garbage didnt get picked up on time and your street didnt get fixed
5817943 politicians understand that the number of community residents that come out for a community meeting probably represent 10 times the number of votes
5817944 it might have been small victories to the outside world but to us it was big it meant those kids could get the jobs they could buy things to start back to school
5817945 we saw what could happen we saw what can be done if the community has the resources and somebody to come in and train them ill always be grateful for that
5817946 im a lot more of a hothead than barack is
5817947 barack is more for compromise you know hell wait and see
5817948 so i would say to myself ok im not really great at the high road because the road is already crumbling ok so i dont know if i can make the road higher
5817949 this is the only area of chicago where real transportation does not run to the city limits
5817950 we have a whole community thats isolated with no way to get to jobs
5817951 with sen obamas help we wound up getting president bush to sign the transportation bill allocating 580 million for the extension of the red line train
5817952 we may someday soon have a president in the white house who will listen to people like us
5817953 then maybe finally well have someone who will respond to our needs
5817954 there can be no business as usual with russia under the present circumstances
5817955 they blame us as if there were no requirements for the georgian side in the six points of the cease fire agreement
5817956 i mean the requirements to bring back their troops to the places where they are on a permanent basis
5817957 military action must cease definitively and military forces must return to their positions held prior to the outbreak of hostilities
5817958 as long as russian forces are basically occupying a large part of georgia i cannot see a nato russia council convene at whatever level
5817959 i should add that we certainly do not have the intention to close all doors in our communication with russia but the future will depend on the concrete actions from the russian side
5817960 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5817961 his hands legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
5817962 there are the bloodstains on the wall and here it is dried on the floor
5817963 and here a womans shoes she was a victim of the militia we found her corpse in the grave
5817964 here is a chain we found tied to an old mans body
5817965 spies you will dig your own graves long live the mehdi army
5817966 we found this chain on an old mans corpse that we dug out of the grave
5817967 we recovered his corpse completely rotten his hands and legs were amputated and his head was decapitated
5817968 their families are in the district the day before yesterday at noon they tried to assassinate me but i was able to call the police for help
5817969 they said they were just taking him for a few minutes for an investigation
5817970 but they never released him and we heard he might be buried behind the mosque
5817971 ive got nothing for you on the vp sweepstakes anything in that regard ought to be directed to the mccain campaign
5817972 i dont talk about the vp stuff because i think its mostly speculation and i just have stopped talking about it
5817973 id never given up on the armband and never will do
5817974 id heard the whispers rio got the armband so i was a little bit shocked but ive got to make the most of it
5817975 my target now is to qualify for the world cup and thats the aim going forward
5817976 rio when he was captain played very well the same level as john
5817977 it was not easy for me to choose because they are very good players
5817978 the big personality of john was the reason i chose john but rio is very important to the team
5817979 it showed the kind of character i am to the manager to come back and bounce back from what had been a big disappointment to myself
5817980 maybe that persuaded him the manager gave me a big boost by giving me the armband
5817981 i played well and scored the goal and it helped remove a small bit of the heartache
5817982 he has said it will not solve our problem and that its not real hes wrong and the american people know it
5817983 new drilling has to be part of our energy solution it will not solve this problem alone alternative energy will not solve this problem alone conservation will not solve this problem alone solving our energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
5817984 it will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and biofuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like clean coal nuclear power and offshore drilling like that done on this rig
5817985 the times are too serious for this kind of politics
5817986 is a man who has served this nation honorably and he correctly stated that one of the chief criteria for the american people in this election is going to be who can exercise the best judgment as commander in chief
5817987 but instead of just offering policy answers he turned to a typical laundry list of political attacks
5817988 behind all of these claims and positions by sen obama lies the ambition to be president whats less apparent is the judgment to be commander in chief
5817989 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country i love america so do you and so does john mccain
5817990 when i look out at this audience i see people of different political views you are democrats and republicans and independents but you all served together and fought together and bled together under the same proud flag you did not serve a red america or a blue america you served the united states of america
5817991 now its time to succeed in iraq by turning iraq over to its sovereign government we should not keep sending our troops to fight tour after tour of duty while our military is overstretched
5817992 we should not keep spending 10 billion a month in iraq while americans struggle in a sluggish economy ending the war will allow us to invest in america to strengthen our military and to finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan and the border region of pakistan
5817993 looking at the radar it looks like were right on the path
5817994 it seems to be getting worse we may be sailing in our neighborhood
5817995 im going need a rowboat to get out of my house
5817996 id say get out of a mobile home because its like a cracker box
5817997 angel did not want to be dressed in your typical suit though as you can see angel has on what probably is an ed hardy knock off t shirt with the long white sleeves underneath you know you rocked this same look in 8th grade he also has on his dolce and gabbana sunglasses silver cross necklace and to top it off a new york yankees hat
5817998 ya know so im thinking about it because ya know i have players like nick young whos goofy so we can do paintball shooting and see who can get hurt on the grotto jumping into the pool
5817999 johns helped wpmt tv to unprecedented heights and larrys experience in new orleans makes him the perfect person to keep the momentum going

5818001 i didnt believe in my wildest dreams that id be olympic champion
5818002 but the dream didnt come from nothing i had to work hard to achieve it i cant find the words to describe this victory
5818003 bahrain is a small country so winning gold is a very big thing
5818004 i had many problems along the way but they were positive experiences and i learned from the problems
5818005 this is huge for new zealand and for athletics in general
5818006 we have such a rich tradition to get a bronze to me means just as much
5818007 i just remember i am here and i have won a gold medal that is all that matters to me right now
5818008 the rivalry has always been there theyve always been strong so its nothing new
5818009 i dont think anythings changed just because of what happening in the 100
5818010 we unwrapped her and felt she was moving we didnt believe it at first then she began holding my mothers hand and then we saw her open her mouth
5818011 i would say the message is we were disappointed with our performance at e3 there were titles like which we think will be really fun titles that we should have showcased
5818012 while details on amds high end ati radeon hd 4870 x2 graphics card began surfacing last month today this dual gpu graphics card has formally launched and will begin shipping to retailers the good news this time around is that this graphics card will actually be something worth looking at under linux now that theres the needed crossfire support on the horizon were not yet permitted to publish the linux crossfire benchmarks but today we have a few pieces of information to share about the radeon hd 4870 x2 on linux
5818013 the fact that sir simon jenkins hates the great russian novelist dostoevsky is also a major reason for thinking that he the great russian novelist has something worth saying

5818017 its important for ford to remain active in hydrogen and fuel cell development as a long term renewable fuel solution
5818018 weve had a lot of great experience with these cars and theyre running quite well
5818019 we expected the fuel cells to be much more problematic under real world conditions but its a credit to our development process that the vehicles have been very robust
5818020 were very satisfied with the fords performance range and overall reliability and were encouraged that the doe is extending the program because much more work needs to be done to advance this technology to commercialization
5818021 having zero emission vehicles like the ford in our fleet ensures that we continue to promote clean transportation
5818022 with continued advancement and rigorous testing of this technology automakers will be in able to produce fuel cell vehicles that compete very effectively with internal combustion engines without compromise to performance safety cost or reliability
5818023 were so much farther ahead than we were on the first generation
5818024 we have better development processes and robust disciplines in the way were doing things
5818025 our fuel cell customers are very interested to know whats next and were looking forward to demonstrating it

5818027 amd has done a great job with the radeon hd 4870 x2 and it has snatched the crown for the fastest graphics card in the world back from nvidia in the process like weve said though its not all rosy and there are drawbacks associated with buying a radeon hd 4870 x2 just like there are with any other multi gpu configuration as long as youre prepared to accept them then the radeon hd 4870 x2 is well worth considering if youve got that kind of cash to throw around the geforce gtx 280s new price point makes it seem like an attractive buy as well with cards starting anywhere from about 275 including vat if anything though the radeon hd 4870 x2 makes a single radeon hd 4870 or geforce gtx 260 look like better options today because its almost as if theres too much horsepower on tap here with amds new flagship card right now the radeon hd 4870 x2s most impressive performance gains can really only be seen at the lofty resolution of 2 560 x 1 600 or with high levels of anti aliasing at 1 920 x 1 200 at lower resolutions or lower levels of aa the gains just arent there at all however given that theres a slew of new and hopefully more graphically intense games about to hit the shelves before christmas picking up a radeon hd 4870 x2 if youve got a 24 inch widescreen doesnt seem like such a bad idea you can play todays games with stupidly high levels of aa and hopefully tomorrows games at native resolution with no big compromises to image quality
5818028 there is little room to debate that the new amd radeon hd 4870 x2 2gb is the best performing graphics card on the market by combining the power of a pair of rv770 gpus along with 2gb of gddr5 memory the r700 design is able to run away from nvidias geforce gtx 280 1gb card handily our various game tests proved this crysis call of duty 4 and grid showed big gains for amds new card at resolutions 2048x1536 and 2560x1600 though they were minimal at 1600x1200

5818034 im a professional business manager i have a staff of more than a dozen i have worked for many high profile actors musicians and multi million dollar corporations why would i steal from rihanna
5818035 i showed her all the paperwork and tried to explain to her the circumstances but she wouldnt listen she called me all sorts of horrible names and stormed off i now feel compelled to share with the world the background story as i will not allow my name to be slandered
5818036 def jam doesnt fund rihanna properly so marc uses the money rihanna makes from third party endorsements and from tours to fund her album and music videos
5818037 why is def jam lacking in funding support for there act why was so much money spent how much exactly williams continues
5818038 her record label def jam has put out 3 albums in a time span of 2 years a lot of that was orchestrated through her management rebel one it was never def jams intention to release so many albums back to back but marc jordan found loop holes and ways to make it happen a lot of the money rihanna made through her endorsements between covergirl cosmetics samsung notice that the majority of rihannas videos have a cell phone in it
5818039 after the release of rihanna and teairra mari def jam had intention to drop both acts because their album sales were not successful
5818040 then came for the repackaging of her album good girl gone bad which is called good girl gone bad reloaded that entire project was funded through rihannas money take a bow was bought through her money the video was created with her money and so is her most recent video and single disturbia the label didnt even want to pay a dime for anything close to 750 000 was spent on those two songs alone and now she expects to see money in her account

5818044 the u s is not out of the woods i think the financial crisis is at the halfway point perhaps i would even go further to say the worst is to come
5818045 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
5818046 we have to see more consolidation in the financial sector before this is over
5818047 the damages and costs ordered by the court are significant and should act as a deterrent

5818061 ive dedicated two years of my life to this im so pleased ive helped us up the medal table this is the proudest moment of my life
5818062 i said that getting the first fight out of the way was important because of the nerves we got our tactics spot on i wasnt throwing the right so much in my first fight so ive been working on that all week
5818063 ive got a notepaper and pen next to my bed
5818064 its just absolutely amazing it might not have been the best way to do it but with the conditions being so tricky it was the best way of making sure of gold

5818070 were very pleased that the court recognized that the mbtas legal arguments were meritless
5818071 the mbtas attempts to silence these students were not only misguided but blatantly unconstitutional
5818072 the judge today correctly found that it was unlikely that the cfaa would apply to security researchers giving an academic talk
5818073 a presentation at a security conference is not some sort of computer intrusion its protected speech and vital to the free flow of information about computer security vulnerabilities silencing researchers does not improve security the vulnerability was there before the students discovered it and would remain in place regardless of whether the students publicly discussed it or not
5818074 the only thing keeping the students and the mbta from working together cooperatively to resolve the fare payment card security issues is the lawsuit itself
5818075 the mbta would be far better off focusing on improving the mbtas fare payment security instead of pursuing needless litigation

5818089 if there is a trend or dynamic toward lower oil prices venezuela will consider the possibility of a cut in production this is the position that we will take at the next opec meeting
5818090 the price must be maintained at a level close to us100 because the costs have increased
5818091 the market is reacting to reports that opec may cut production
5818092 standing back from all of this to glance at the big picture would certainly seem to endorse the oil markets sharp month long decline
5818093 oil has lost its bullish mojo and it may take a major event or a great technical stand to go get its groove back

5818155 timing is always an important consideration for events such as these that concentrate many commercials into one evening when timing aligns with a major vehicle launch for one of our brands they fit more naturally into the marketing plans that isnt the case as we head into the next broadcast season making it more difficult to justify the roi

5818163 i think its cool that theyre exercising their right to protest
5818164 this affects all of us in the state its worth losing an hour of school if it gets kids schwarzeneggers attention because if they take everything away that would be worse

5818166 governor arnold give us our money back stop stealing from our kids
5818167 epcc and jfav campaigned hard against prop 98 because most of our seniors and veterans are renters and will be affected by the ballot measure we are happy that the measure prop 98 was defeated
5818168 the voters saw that proposition 98 was a deceptive initiative in fact the worst kind of ballot abuse where a populist issue is used to conceal an attack on renters the environment homeowners and our communities
5818169 its kind of un american to force a housing provider or any other business to provide services at less than fair market value

5818174 if he brewer was standing next to me then no legislature no governor would try to take the kind of cuts out of education that theyre talking about
5818175 it was unfortunate and we are indignant at the manner in which the police decided to deal with a group of people who were causing disturbances these were young anarchists who often join our marches who in every single march in the past in los angeles this is the seventh may day march inaudible have been isolated away from the crowd
5818176 the use of heavily armed squads of us immigration and customs enforcement ice agents backed by state and local police that stormed the slaughter house while two government helicopters hovered overhead reminds us of the iraq war being reduplicated here in the united states
5818177 the cdir and the epcc sees the step as a right move towards the active defense of immigrant r rights being trampled by ice

5818180 one of the things we have heard was reported in haiti is that the president of brazil lula plans on going to haiti very shortly with the head of the u n and lula is concerned about how brazil is being portrayed to the world for its role in haiti hes expressed some concern that brazil is being seen as anti poor people and part of an occupying force etc it must mean that he is feeling the heat somewhat
5818181 they firmly believe that lovinsky is alive and is being held and of course no one knows where
5818182 also two weeks before he was taken it was announced that he had some interest in running for a seat in the senate and if lovinsky had run he would have won and not only that people probably would have wanted him to be more than a senator so shortly after that he was taken
5818183 we might not look like theres so many people standing here but there are 2 109 names on the petition as of 8 00 last night they were from sierra leone and tanzania and india and poland and croatia and brazil and argentina and mexico and the u s and canada and a lot of european countries

5818185 his academic record was awful and it shows over and over again whenever mccain is called upon to think on his feet
5818186 i am sick and tired of the president of the united states embarrassing me the world we live in is too complex to entrust it to someone else whose idea of intellectual curiosity and grasp of foreign policy issues is to tell us he can look into vladimir putins eyes and see into his soul
5818187 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself

5818211 although many australians dream of living on the coast or in the country in reality the best quality of life in australia is found in the suburbs

5818213 a person of substance would have presented himself to his fellow leaders among the pacific island countries to account for the undertaking he gave to them

5818229 you dont know my state my state was a slave state my state is a border state my state has the eighth largest black population in the country my state is anything from a northeast liberal state

5818231 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
5818232 theres less than 1 percent of the population of iowa that is african american there is probably less than 4 or 5 percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what youre dealing with
5818233 it was a connect i mean i could tell how that man felt thats how i feel
5818234 i landed at the airport i know you all know that i dont spend a lot of time i dont spend a lot of time writing speeches i do them on the back of envelopes i do them i mean i work on them but i do them some of you have traveled with me and watch how i do them
5818235 and so i was getting in the car and a young man named david wilhelm who runs my campaign and i said david i dont have a close and he said weve prepared you seven or eight closes
5818236 but i dont agree with any of them he said well why dont you do what you do on the kinnock thing that expresses what you feel and i said youre right i said you know thinking about it that applies to me and thats honest to god true what happened riding over to the debate
5818237 during the 1960s i was in fact very concerned about the civil rights movement
5818238 i am not culturally one of those guys who like to i dont fit very well because im not a joiner
5818239 now look youre looking at a middle class guy i am who i am im not big on flak jackets and tie dyed shirts you know thats not me im serious
5818240 you know i mean i hated law school i really did
5818241 with democrats like joe biden we dont need to shoot too many arrows
5818242 those of us who can fit in one seat should not have to suffer because obese people cannot unless they have some sort of medical condition they need to buy two seats i think the airlines have quite a battle ahead with this situation as it seems the amount of obese people continues to grow rapidly
5818243 i think that it is so unfair to punish the consumers most of whom are loyal multi flight purchasers because of the higher costs of fuel it boils down to pandering to a common base and if you are in any way different you are punished it seems it is fair game to discriminate against the obese many of whom are medically not at fault for their condition whos next the wheelchair bound

5818322 neither functions as a responsible media outlet and both offend catholics as well as others to allow them access to the democratic national convention sends a message to catholics they will not forget
5818323 we look for leah daughtry ceo of the convention to nix them asap
5818324 andy towle has been baptized with a dunk in catholic league head bill donohues putrid vat of rhetoric
5818325 it took me back to when donohue became obsessed with my ass cheeks a few years ago to the point where he issued an alert about them
5818326 i observed that the churchs claim that homosexuality is intrinsically disordered had done much to empower those bashers and donohue lashed out he had actually been sending me nasty emails prior to that obsessed with my syndicated column in new york press at the time but finally i warranted an alert
5818327 i n his attack on me in his alert from the catholic league donohue made sexual remarks that surely many good catholics like my mom would see as profane
5818328 were disappointed with mich we never thought that anyone who has had as much practice as he has in turning the other cheek would ever write such an intrinsically disordered article
5818329 bill donohues catholic league unfortunately is a right wing radical religious group masked as an advocate with no business meddling in the machinations of u s politics most americans believe that the separation of church and state makes america strong
5818330 once again using the shameful tactic long used by right wing groups to link lgbt subject matter solely with sex donohue states towleroad describes itself as
5818331 the pope has deemed homosexuality an intrinsic moral evil and as recently as new years day ranked same sex marriage with nuclear arms proliferation environmental pollution economic inequality abortion and birth control as threats to world peace
5818332 yet we would never suggest that catholics not be able to attend the convention
5818333 a shortage of priests for pastoral leadership is not an adequate reason to suppress or combine parishes
5818334 canon law strongly recommends liturgies of the word and group prayer in the absence of priests clearly implying that the life and worship of the community must continue even when priestly leadership is absent
5818335 can never be done appropriately with simply social models of restructuring

5818350 we create feature teams with n developers n testers and 1 2n program managers
5818351 on average a feature team is about 40 developers across the windows 7 project
5818352 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows
5818353 it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds cliche but what i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5818354 was to discuss windows performance and or just make windows faster theres a lot to this topic so we expect to talk about this quite a bit over the next months
5818355 vista really is a dog compared to xp performance wise and compatibility wise yes it is prettier and it has the search facility but its uac networking and compatibility just sux i always turn uac off it is so annoying for overall compatibility and speed xp is still the gold standard for me i truly hope microsoft listens to its customers and makes windows 7 everything vista should have been faster as compatible hardware and software and easier to use than xp hey and dump the drm bloat too your customers dont need it
5818356 ill probably post this multiple times until it gets noticed but i really think windows 7 needs to be a super efficient core with plug in style features that way as a gamer or just someone who needs all the speed he can get i can just run windows barebones with only the applications i need
5818357 some have said that the windows team is just too big and that it has reached a size that causes engineering problems
5818358 at the same time i might point out that just looking at the comments there is a pretty significant demand for a broad set of features and changes to windows it takes a set of people to build windows and it is a big project the way that i look at this is that our job is to have the windows team be the right size that sounds clichy but i mean by that is that the team is neither too large nor too small but is effectively managed so that the work of the team reflects the size of the team and you see the project as having the benefits we articulate
5818359 i like the idea a stripped down version of windows 7 just the basics no pretty fluff no bloat and hardware requirements we have 32 guests online
5818360 currently the experience is pretty crappy you have to click through an infobar to allow installation of this component then you have to click yes to say that you really want to run the native content and then you have to click yes again to allow the component to interact with content on the page
5818361 in theory with the right signatures the right security class implementations some eye of newt and a pinch of garlic its possible to get things down to a one time install which would make the component available everywhere
5818362 businesses are taking steps to make their it operations more dynamic and are delving into virtualization as a cornerstone strategy

5818382 i think in a lot of respects we are looking at this season as fresh start
5818383 we have had a very successful group of players graduate over the past two seasons and we have brought in 17 newcomers in that time to take their place
5818384 i think in a lot of respects we are looking at this season as fresh start
5818385 we have had a very successful group of players graduate over the past two seasons and we have brought in 17 newcomers in that time to take their place
5818386 there is definitely an element of redemption from the 2007 season
5818387 last year we didnt come in fit and it felt like we were running uphill from the very beginning we finished the year so poorly losing two road games and then the conference tournament i think people are really excited to get after it this year those feelings have certainly been reinforced since the start of preseason our players came in a week early on their own trained on their own and have been working really hard there is surely an optimism about the team we have had a target on our back for the last few years but it feels different to adopt a new underdog mentality it can energize you if you channel it the right way
5818388 i think this is one of the most talented groups of attacking players we have ever had
5818389 we will have the ability to build an attack through combinations and break down defenses with the drive and dish we also have three or four players who can slice and dice through a crowd i think it will be a lot of fun to put together a mix of those elements that will work
5818390 the offense will run through isleib who can do anything that needs to be done on a soccer field from an attacking standpoint
5818391 additionally we will have some really nice pieces around those three players we will miss a lot redshirting with a knee injury i dont think we can replace everything she does with one player she can head the ball pass it hold it and defend that being said i am really impressed with our new players up front can hold the ball find other players and slice and dice through a defense has been clinical in her finishing with both feet and i think she will be able to score goals jen cristoffers has been hampered with a knee injury but when healthy she has pace bite and a history of scoring goals hopfully we can put it all together and do some damage around our opponents goal
5818392 this is a group that can hold the ball well connect passes and get forward as a unit
5818393 centrally sanchez is a fifth year senior who will return to the midfield to provide a lot of stability and experience she played there in her first two years then last year we put her in the back
5818394 we will also have some very good wide players including reineke is another freshman who can really run at people with the ball and we will use mallory mitamura is another freshman who has shown good instincts defensively and will probably play in the wide midfield but whether we put her in the midfield or in the back she has good instincts on where to be how to disrupt play and position herself well we will have a lot of options and i think we will be able to hang onto the ball really well
5818395 our defense is definitely an area we have to improve on from last year
5818396 more than just tactics or decisions we have to be better mentally we gave up a lot of soft goals either at the wrong time in a game or as a result of a silly play it seemed that whatever we did wrong we got punished for this team has to change its mentality and we have a good group to do that is back from acl surgery after suffering the injury in mid season and we really missed her during conference play on the right side or in the middle morgan is as hard nosed as they come and she will provide some of that bite we missed last year improved tremendously after her freshman year she gives us pace in the back she is a good tackler and is becoming a more well rounded player is back from shoulder surgery and she is another smart player who can handle the ball has gotten stronger and become a better athlete herself both of them could give us some valuable minutes back there lauren porter are both good on the ball good decision makers and are both great in the air is a player we could use in the midfield or in the back wherever we use her she brings a good work ethic and a lot of energy as a freshman and i think she will make an impact
5818397 we dont have a lot of experience coming back in terms of game minutes
5818398 but we do have a lot of good character strong leadership ability and talented goalies
5818399 is a freshman who was named the southern california high school defensive player of the year last year she has great athleticism good feet and is comfortable coming out of her box she has a bright future and will do well for us is another freshman who is a terrific athlete and in the preseason has shown flashes of it she is is getting to the ball making saves and has a lot of tools that we will continue working with
5818400 we always load up the early part of our schedule with tough games
5818401 it helps us get ready for conference play and allows us to test ourselves against quality opponents
5818402 we are always excited to play against schools with good soccer traditions or that come from a conference with strong soccer traditions
5818403 by the time conference competition rolls around our young group will be much more seasoned and ready to take on the mountain west
5818404 over the last few years we really knew who we were as a team going into the season
5818405 it felt like we were just honing ourselves and waiting for the postseason
5818406 our first goal is to play winning soccer we played really attractive soccer a year ago but our mentality wasnt right we gave up goals or failed to put teams away when we had chances and that needs to change we need to play better winning soccer locking down teams on defense making good decisions and making plays when we need to having watched the kids for a few weeks now i have confidence that we can be as good as any team we have had here i think it is overall the most skillful group we have had and i expect that to translate into good soccer and wins there is no question that we are capable of winning the conference championship but we have to go out and prove it
5818407 its not about lawsuits but fairness respecting work and the american dream
5818408 it might not register that its really land at this point

5818448 its not easy to watch over them being children they naturally like to run about
5818449 its better to leave them at home under the care of family members than to bring them to the hypermarket and allow them to run about when something bad happens to them we will be blamed
5818450 such children are difficult to control so parents take the easy way out by letting them loose
5818451 i hope sharlinies case will be the last as a result of parents not being aware of their childrens movements at the time

5818517 we aim to show that the protection mechanisms in windows vista are particularly ineffective for preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers
5818518 the design and implementation of the memory protection mechanisms in windows have a number of limitations that reduce their effectiveness
5818519 in this paper we demonstrated that the memory protection mechanisms available in the latest versions of windows are not always effective when it comes to preventing the exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities in browsers they raise the bar but the attacker still has a good chance of being able to bypass them

5818549 maastricht moet zeker niet bang zijn voor een florida aan de maas
5818550 maastricht oefent grote aantrekkingskracht uit op senioren deze groep is kapitaalkrachtig waardoor van deze groep een forse economische impuls uitgaat dat vinden we terug in tal van voorzieningen die op deze groep worden toegesneden de vergrijzing zet door het aandeel van jongeren neemt af en deze groep legt ook geen autonome druk op de richting van de economie voorzieningen voor jongeren en starters zijn derhalve matig tot slecht dat gaat dan over wonen winkelen werken en uitgaan jongeren en studenten worden ook niet gezien als waardevol voor de stad ze worden niet onthaald en vooral behandeld als bronnen van overlast als er niks gebeurt zal dit proces doorzetten

5818552 de spanning op dit culturele zelfbeeld van de stad werd nog versterkt door de polarisatie tussen grijs en groen de dubbele vergrijzing en ontgroening de grote paradox van maastricht in de beleving is sprake van een vergrijzende stad terwijl de typering een jonge stad in een vergrijzende of grijze omgeving meer dominant lijkt

5818559 we focused on people who had been on social assistance for an extended time and who were officially categorized as employable we looked at how they experience the new tougher work obligation rules and the hardships they experience
5818560 this study included many people who never get covered by other studies as a result it reveals important new insights about many of societys most marginalized members
5818561 the government likes to say declining welfare caseloads is purely a good news story but it has never done adequate studies that would allow it to make such claims
5818562 so we decided to delve deeper we wanted to learn more about why people leave assistance and what happens after they leave

5818681 home schooling is more widely accepted now as a viable alternative to traditional school attendance however we have had several enquiries from home educating families about how best to prepare their teenage child for the rigors of university entrance exams or sats and a levels when the child has had no experience of formal testing whatsoever
5818682 im not for a moment saying that home education is unable to prepare a child for university or disadvantaging them in any way far from it the vast majority of home schooled children that i have met personally have been bright articulate and knowledgeable usually with excellent social skills i would just like to urge home schooling families to plan ahead for the eventuality that their child may want to take exams in preparation for university sometimes in subjects that the family may not be able teach or explore alone when the fact that the child may never have been tested formally in their life is added to the mix the family can suddenly feel out of depth and thats when they tend to call us
5818683 realizing that help is needed as early as possible is very important especially for home schooled children who havent taken any external examinations this is because there are skills such as timed essay writing that the child will need to acquire in order to demonstrate knowledge in standardized examinations we have a lot of experience of working with home schooling families therefore we know how best to prepare students that have not had any experience of exams so choosing the right private tutors agency is also a must

5818843 alles aan jan is leuk hij heeft humor verzint onverwachte dingen en hij slaat zich heldhaftig door zijn stemproblemen heen
5818844 en dan tegen de artsen in het ikaziaziekenhuis hij begint aan stemoefeningen het duurt nog wel zes weken voor hij weer iets tegen mij mag zeggen tot die tijd blaast hij als hij bedoelt ik hou van jou en als hij me niet ziet klapt hij in zijn handen roepen mag niet ik heb het heel druk op de set van onderweg naar morgen aan de ene kant is het fijn dat ik weet dat mijn grote liefde thuis op me zit te wachten aan de andere kant heb je ook schuldgevoel ik wil voor hem zorgen
5818845 ja de uitspraak doen we later maar ik vind het heel lief dat hij zich wil verdiepen in mijn wortels kijk ik grap het vaak tegen jans familie maar in feite ben ik heel volendams de spanjaarden hebben immers de eerste huisjes in het visserdorp gebouwd het is gesticht door mijn voorvaderen dus als jans huis daar klaar is zal ik me snel thuis voelen

5818879 an argument against allowing the families of murder victims to view executions
5818880 the compromise bill which was distributed to senate members on tuesday would allow the death penalty only for those twice convicted of raping a child 13 or younger it also boosts mandatory minimum sentences for a variety of sex crimes against children

5818882 after accounting for some of the many factors that may influence penalty decisions neither race of the defendant nor race of the victim appreciably improved prediction of who was sentenced to death
5818883 relationship of offender and victim race to death penalty sentences in california
5818884 the race of the victim effect does not hold up however at the decision of the states attorney to advance a case to penalty trial and at the decision of the judge or jury to impose a death sentence given that a penalty trial has occurred
5818885 the race of the victim does not appear to matter when the decision is to advance a case to the penalty phase or to sentence a defendant to death after a penalty phase hearing
5818886 among the subset of cases where the case actually does reach a penalty trial the victims race does not have a significant impact on the imposition of a death sentence
5818887 when the prosecuting jurisdiction is added to the model the effect for the victims race diminishes substantially and is no longer statistically significant
5818888 any attempt to deal with any racial disparity in the imposition of the death penalty in maryland cannot ignore the substantial variability that exists in different states attorneys offices in the processing of death cases
5818889 there is no race of the offender victim effect at either the decision to advance a case to penalty hearing or the decision to sentence a defendant to death given a penalty hearing
5818890 there is no evidence that the race of the defendant matters at any stage once case characteristics are controlled for
5818891 we found no evidence that the race of the defendant matters in processing of capital cases in the state

5818893 where the discretion that is fundamental to our criminal justice process is involved we decline to assume that what is unexplained by measured factors is invidious
5818894 to properly protect the people in baltimore city and other jurisdictions like it we must restore public confidence in and support of capital punishment so that prosecutors can seek it in appropriate cases and jurors will impose it the first step toward that end is to debunk the myth that capital punishment is imposed discriminatorily the numbers are there in the opponentss own studies once we cut through the spin and look at the facts

5818935 guilt is individual if guilty whites or wealthy people escape the gallows and guilty poor people do not the poor or black do not become less guilty because the others escaped their deserved punishment whether due to willful discrimination capriciousness or unavoidable accidental circumstances some people will always get away with murder is that a reason to deny the justice of the punishment of those guilty persons who did not get away their guilt is not diminished by the escape of the others nor do they deserve less punishment because others did not get the punishment they deserve justice involves punishment according to what is deserved by the crime and the guilt of the criminal regardless of whether others guilty of the same crime escape

5819034 is a gripping story of courage endurance and the power of the human spirit in the cruelest of times
5819035 this book is written in such a way that it encourages you to read it page after page without stopping the plot although it is in the form of a novel takes place on a realistic plane sometimes crude sometimes enthusiastic at times sentimental being italian i relished every word every event every individual every action appreciating the truth of it all up to the final page the book deals with the period of the german occupation of a village in tuscany it chronicles the doings of the residents of this village who were forced to go to a nearby farm il cielo and who lived close to the tragedies that were taking place at the hands of the germans and the fascists in the nearby villages including the killing of the priest of the village who was in contact via radio with the allied forces and the massacre carried out by the german ss in the village of santanna di stazzema where old women and children were cut down without a plausible reason this novel although it is limited to one village in the north of tuscany is the real testimony of what happened throughout italy from the time the country was occupied from september 1943 to april 1945 until the end when the germans surrendered in that area of the war
5819036 milwaukee native paul salsini has written his first novel based on facts and stories he heard from his cousin who survived german occupation and the allied invsion of the region where his grandfather was born the cielo a novel of wartorn tuscany recreates actual evnts in an imagined place to deliver a story thats long on action and short on style this veteran journalist dramatizes thorough research showing us how world war ii was a difficult and dangerous time to be a good italian
5819037 this was a lovely story about a time and place that i know little about but find intriguing you did a wonderful job of bringing this place to life i loved all the details about what day to life was like both in santantonio and the cielo i also thought you had a great premise and you pulled it off beautifully that this mixed group of villagers were trapped together in this house and were forced to learn about themselves and each other over the months they were stuck together each villager had a compelling issue to deal with but my heart went out to poor maria i knew nothing about the massacre at santanna and it was horrifying you do a nice job of building up the tension telling us from the start that the nazis are willing to kill innocent civilians as retribution for the acts of the partisans i also found gina very compelling and i mourned for carlotta but was glad she had lucia and her baby it was impossible to put this book down
5819038 would seriously undermine the credibility of us leadership on non proliferation and disarmament
5819039 at a time when former secretaries of state henry kissinger and george shultz have joined with former senator sam nunn and former secretary of defense william perry to call on the us to work for nuclear disarmament it doesnt make sense to start building new weapons
5819040 the leaders of this committee understood last year that there is no solid justification for this program yet the administration asks for money year after year congress and the people of the united states are committed to reducing the nuclear danger and a step toward that end is eliminating funding for rrw

5819137 our vision is scotland can become the first country in the world to become fully literate
5819138 the job of the commission that will include members from a range of interests including education parents and business will be to develop a national plan that will support those delivering education in scotland to achieve a step change in literacy levels
5819139 being able to read is something that every child in scotland should be able to enjoy
5819140 reading gives choices and chances to young people as well as opening up new worlds of books
5819141 i will play my part in working as part of the commission and hope that its work might help scotland produce even more successful writers than we already do
5819142 as a parent i have watched how children who fail to learn to read start to fall behind and then get involved in displacement activities to hide their difficulty
5819143 we know that many of those in prison have poor literacy levels whilst the idea of a parent being unable to read the instructions on a medicine bottle must worry everyone
5819144 i believe dentists who refuse to use mercury amalgam are misinformed
5819145 dentists who advocate elimination of dental amalgam are building their practice at the expense of the rest of the profession dental amalgams are perfectly safe
5819146 as long as ada and fda say it is safe then that is good enough for me
5819147 amalgams are great they just look so bad that nobody wants them
5819148 patients just dont want them any more regardless of the higher cost of resins
5819149 amalgam is my friend larger composites after three to five years usually look worn and leaking
5819150 although we place amalgam restorations rarely there are occasions where this is truly the most appropriate restorative material dentists who have completely eliminated it from their practices are really doing their patients a disservice by not giving them a safe reasonable option
5819151 its a toxic waste when i remove from someones body but not when it is in a human body
5819152 we cant put it in landfills and any excess has to be picked up by hazardous waste haulers yet we can bury a filling that is 50 mercury three inches from a persons brain
5819153 composite is not inert it releases formaldehyde what foreign material would you rather have in your mouth
5819154 there are big concerns with bis phenol a components of resins
5819155 unlike composite amalgam does not release estrogen as a byproduct
5819156 for all those who say this is a horrible material how many 20 30 and even 40 year old amalgams do you see out there
5819157 they are the most durable of all restorations with the exception of gold that are available at this time
5819158 until i find posterior composites that can last fifteen or twenty years i will continue to offer the amalgam as a restoration
5819159 while it may still be a safe material for use its long term use leads to cracked and broken and often devitalized teeth
5819160 in my 30 years of practice i have observed the failure of amalgam to adequately restore teeth 99 of the time it is the source of fractured teeth
5819161 i stopped using amalgam in 1984 the 3m composites i placed then are still serving my patients today
5819162 even if it was a beautiful tooth colored material it would still suck big time
5819163 we all seem to be concerned about the welfare of the patient but i worry about the long term effect of exposure to mercury to dentists and staff for the last ten years i have been conducting a research study on this very topic i have discovered that all dentists and staff who either place or remove mercury fillings have extremely high levels of mercury in their systems some of the offices like mine do not place mercury fillings they only remove them
5819164 i have high levels of mercury in my system based on testing with my doctor
5819165 when we were in dental school we were taught they were silver amalgam fillings mercury amalgam is a term invented by the media
5819166 were you to list all of the ingredients of either material nobody in their right mind would want them in their mouth
5819167 dentists are so passionate about the controversy over amalgam that we received a record number of responses to this survey
5819168 the ada says amalgam is safe consumer groups insist its dangerous and the fda still hasnt made an official ruling its been used in dental work for over a thousand years and saved untold numbers of teeth but they used to say it was okay for pregnant women to smoke so really how are you supposed to know whats safe
5819169 we knew there was a literacy skills crisis amongst uk adults but our survey results were shocking
5819170 teaching of grammar and punctuation has been largely neglected for about 30 years and we are seeing the results now

5819190 our original goals were to control student behavior and build community but along the way we learned that these are conflicting goals
5819191 high stakes accountability and performance assessment are based on conflicting principles
5819192 one encourages conformity to externally imposed standards while the other grows out of emergent interaction between teachers and students
5819193 using dna technology the dna pcr test allows us to specifically identify oral bacteria that cause infections much earlier and treat them before they cause severe damage to a persons health
5819194 to administer the test we gather saliva samples from the patients mouth using cotton tipped swabs
5819195 the samples are then shipped to a laboratory for analysis the lab sends us a detailed report identifying the oral bacteria present allowing us to quickly and precisely diagnose and treat periodontal disease
5819196 knowing that good oral health is an indicator of overall health and may in fact help prevent systemic disease should be motivation enough for everyone to regularly visit a dentist
5819197 but even without insurance reimbursement the peace of mind that comes as a result of the exam is worth it
5819198 the church is called to be christs faithful evangelist as we are going into the world making disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all he has commanded
5819199 the church is called to undertake this mission even at the risk of losing its life trusting in god alone as the author and giver of life sharing the gospel and doing those deeds in the world that point beyond themselves to the new reality in christ

5819219 prohealth care ranks among the most technologically and clinically advanced healthcare systems in the u s we are excited that they have partnered with us to monitor their young patients
5819220 the safety and well being of all of our patients is top priority at prohealth care with that in mind we decided to upgrade to a more robust system we conducted a thorough analysis of infant and pediatric security vendors rf technologies and its safe place solution really impressed us
5819221 not only were we amazed by the technology but also with the knowledge and skill of its staff
5819222 we felt incorporating both infant and pediatric units were important infants as well as children under five years of age or those older with extenuating circumstances are fitted with a transmitter
5819223 its a comprehensive security system that provides peace of mind
5819224 during install and since installation rf technologies has really maintained that very high level of customer service to me the measure of real success is how a company handles the training of the weekend and off shifts its staff truly became part of our staff during training it couldnt have gone more smoothly

5819230 despite the public perception that the ama represents all physicians only one third belong to the organization membership has declined from 300 000 in the mid 1990s to 260 000 in 2003
5819231 i submit to those who think that doctors should not be involved in the dying process that
5819232 the use of a physicians clinical skill and judgment for purposes other than promoting an individuals health and welfare undermines a basic ethical foundation of medicine first do no harm therefore requiring physicians to be involved in executions violates their oath to protect lives and erodes public confidence in the medical profession
5819233 in general physicians are hiding behind the hippocratic oath and other anachronistic dictums as a pretext for their own repugnance and visceral abhorrence of capital punishment and their lack of wherewithal regarding the possibility of their participation
5819234 that having doctors involved in executions will help ensure they are more humane
5819235 autopsy organ harvestation abortion pelvic examinations colonoscopies amputations brutal surgeries like pelvic exenteration and the like

5819240 that momentous occasion will be in everyones minds and hearts when kay is consecrated bishop on may 22 in the same cathedral
5819241 her previous experience within the diocese including terms as school chaplain canon of the cathedral parish priest and archdeacon means she is one of the best qualified priests to take on this role at this stage
5819242 we expect this news will be greeted with joy and excitement among anglicans and many others in australia and beyond
5819243 parishes that cannot in good conscience recognize the ministry of a woman bishop will be offered the services of a male bishop
5819244 since the first consecration of a woman bishop in 1989 women have been serving with distinction alongside men as bishops in many parts of the anglican communion a development long taken for granted
5819245 australia has been a while catching up but our time has come and i know that the great majority of australian anglicans will warmly welcome this day
5819246 indeed i am conscious of many other christians not to mention people of other great religious traditions who are simply delighted that leadership in the church can be shared in this way
5819247 on a more personal note and putting my natural fears and sense of inadequacy to one side i am trying to trust the church discerning me as a bishop and i simply rely on gods grace as i face the future

5819264 to preach the gospel of the kingdom does not in any way negate or denigrate the gospel of salvation in fact it is the gospel of the kingdom that leads to true salvation which is why the lord jesus himself preached this gospel as well as the first century apostles redemption reconciliation and restoration are all part of the gospel of the kingdom and these are reasons for which the kingdom is coming however the gospel of the kingdom does include more than the salvation of believers it is the message that the rightful king is coming to take over

5819394 in een dicht donker bos nabij de duitse grens in reutum lag verscholen tussen gebladerte en open weiden een idyllisch vakantiehuisje waar de theatergroep die dag zijn intrek zou nemen om er een maand lang niet meer weg te gaan naarmate de tijd verstreek kwamen er meer mensen in en om het huisje en rezen de tenten als paddestoelen uit de grond hier zou gedurende vier weken een kleinschalig dorpje verrijzen zoals reutum dat nog niet eerder had gezien acteurs technici kostuumontwerpsters cateraars en kinderen leefden vredig samen in de nieuwe commune die door de theatergroep was gesticht maar toen werd het mei gezeten op de verrezen tribune zaten ze daar achttien acteurs onder leiding van de regisseur die uiterste concentratie van zijn spelers eiste maar plotseling klonk over het veld een onheilspellend gebrom gesprekken verstomden ogen speurden hele blikvelden af op zoek naar de bron van het naargeestige geluid en daar toen de lichtman de knop omdraaide en het veld in volle spots zette werden ze zichtbaar als helicopters roterend langs de lampen als kamikazepiloten stortend op de nietsvermoedende acteurs waren ze plotseling in grote getale bezig met het heroveren van hun veld meikevers aangedreven door blinde na viteit vlogen de acteurs in de haren op de lip en op de zenuwen gillend sprongen drie actrices op vluchtend naar het vakantiehuisje maar ook daar waren de moordende meikevers inmiddels binnengedrongen nergens helemaal nergens waren ze veilig voor de geweerhaakte poten van de mega insecten die ongenadig hun gebied terug eisten maar daar was ze de redster in nood bevrijdster van angsten en paniekaanvallen de strijdlustige zola toonde geen angst en met een verpletterende koelbloedigheid pakte ze de meikevers op stopte ze in kooitjes en liet ze niet meer ontsnappen en vanachter roze plastic met gaatjes durfden de drie actrices dichterbij te komen om de meikevers eens van dichtbij te bekijken en toen toen kwam de regen die de verderfelijke monsters wegspoelde en in de vergetelheid deed raken de rust keerde terug op de haarlerheide en de theatergroep zette een prachtige voorstelling neer die zijn weerga niet kende maar soms als je in het donker heel goed luistert kun je ze misschien nog horen de larven van de nieuwe generatie meikevers die genadeloos zullen opstaan als er ooit in de toekomst weer een theatergroep neerstrijkt in hun habitat

5819602 het is nog maar net afgerond ik schrijf een artikel voor een medisch tijdschrift en de verwachting was dat het nog maanden zou duren voordat het naar buiten zou komen dat het onderzoek nu al in de media verschijnt zoals in dagblad metro http www clubmetro nl vind ik niet erg het is altijd tobben om kinderen bij elkaar te krijgen voor een onderzoek dat is zo jammer als je ziet hoe goed de resultaten zijn
5819603 dat zijn indianenverhalen die ik jammer genoeg nog steeds hoor ik zie dat bij kinderen die bij mij op consult komen sommigen zijn al jaren op dieet gezet natuurlijk bedoelen de ouders het goed maar vaak heeft zon kindje ten onrechte al jaren bepaalde dingen niet mogen eten dat vind ik sneu de realiteit is dat kinderen op meerdere voedingsmiddelen tegelijk reageren dus nooit op 1 middel suiker kan best een van de middelen zijn waar een kind niet tegen kan maar dat hoeft niet per se
5819604 het is dus een zeer individueel op maat gemaakt dieet op het basisdieet wordt streng een eliminatie toegepast zodat uiteindelijk een geschikt dieet voor dat ene kindje ontstaat
5819605 opvallend is dat de kinderen die zon dieet volgen naderhand op alle vragenlijsten goed scoren er is een groot verschil in gedrag zowel thuis als op school
5819606 ze zaten namelijk ook in de begeleidingscommissie van het onderzoek dus ik had een andere reactie verwacht maar nieuwe dingen roepen altijd weerstand op ook blijkbaar bij de pati ntenvereniging
5819607 ten eerste heb ik niet in de begeleidingscommissie van dit onderzoek gezeten maar in een ouder onderzoek ik kan dus niet zoveel over deze resultaten zeggen ik heb wel enige scepsis dat heeft onder meer te maken met de diagnostiek hebben de kinderen wel daadwerkelijk adhd beoordeelt mevrouw pelsser dat zelf ik vind dat er iets glibberigs zit in het onderzoek bij jonge kinderen speelt gezonde voeding altijd een rol bij het gedrag of dat gedrag dan ook adhd is is de vraag daarnaast heeft de aparte status van een kind het moet zich aan een strikt dieet houden ook effect en is dat wel zon gezond effect wij houden ons aan de algemene richtlijnen pdf file daar hebben alle mogelijk denkbare deskundigen aan meegewerkt en de effecten van voeding zijn daarin niet bewezen natuurlijk wil je niet dat kinderen pillen moeten slikken maar je wilt wel een toonbaar positief effect daar gaat het om

5819700 the historically passive consumer is changing rapidly not only becoming more informed and confident about purchase decisions but also increasingly taking control of the consumption of information and content that used to be distributed by networks studios publishers and retailers
5819701 we believe this will cause a significant rise in prominence of the internet as a major content consumption and marketing medium
5819702 like many major social trends the changes will not happen overnight and we expect the user revolution which has just begun to last several years before the new regime is fully established and the old statues have all been toppled over

5819723 is a decision that the dean does not support in any way
5819724 i could not disagree more strongly with this decision and i have directed that the popline administrators restore abortion as a search term immediately
5819725 i will also launch an inquiry to determine why this change occurred the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health is dedicated to the advancement and dissemination of knowledge and not its restriction
5819726 we are part of the bush administration so we have to make sure that all parts of the story are told

5819741 ik heb me in sommige gevallen afgevraagd waarom niet n vraag extra is gesteld door de triagist het gesprek had dan misschien een paar seconden langer geduurd
5819742 de triagist is te veel gericht op de ziekte te weinig op de pati nt
5819743 anders dan een assistent op een praktijk kent de triagist zelden de beller er is meestal geen voorgeschiedenis voorhanden in de vorm van een dossier en sommige bellers kunnen het gevoel niet in hun klacht leggen dat vereist veel vaardigheid van een triagist het is een hele moeilijke baan
5819744 and everybodys favorite pasttime is to gang up on the media they get it from all sides all the time most of them are doing the best they can

5819827 to define what the competition is you have to have a clear idea of the market and were probably at a stage before that

5819832 technological transformations give you the chance to set up new and ambitious ventures thats what i did with fastweb and that is what we are doing with babelgum
5819833 this is much more than tv because we are making the content available all across the world and you have an open platform with freedom of choice
5819834 betting on the success of babelgum is not so much a bet on scaglia as on the technology
5819835 we still dont know how this market will develop and if this will become an important way to get content to consumers but scaglia and his past performance at omnitel and fastweb are an assurance that babelgum will have a good chance of success
5819836 you learn by doing and im certainly better equipped than i was when i started fastweb but a key mistake would be to think that everything is easy
5819837 by and large fastweb is now where i would have expected it to be when i thought about that seven years ago we had to build our network and get subscribers and that is what we have done with babelgum it is a global market that is in evolution i have no clear idea where babelgum will be seven years from now

5819928 those are the three things that i believe are going to cause search to change
5819929 you can see that today in what we have done with image search what we have done with video search
5819930 to say that were not a media company would be hypocrisy
5819931 ive not been successful in finding the right price and the right camera on

5819934 americans across our country are hurting as we all know because of the cost of energy
5819935 gas prices are through the roof energy costs have seeped into our grocery bills making it more expensive to feed our families now as we prepare for the winter its time for us to be more serious about our home heating oil needs and that means we need to start drilling offshore at advanced oil rigs like this one
5819936 we need to drill offshore and we need to do it now if i were president i would call congress back into session and tell them to get to work
5819937 i recognized that that 25 year old man i dont think he really appreciated the life that he was taking that this was a human being

5819959 i dont have no kind of testing material to test the water but i know somethings wrong
5819960 were not finding enough oxygen to support life aquatic life
5819961 this green line is the oxygen right here and at the bottom its reading less than 2 milligrams per liter
5819962 theres no oxygen in the water for shrimp crabs fish to live
5819963 can sense that and they start to move out of the area otherwise they would die the animals that still remain in the sediments have to keep breathing there is not enough oxygen and eventually they will die off
5819964 thats the primary source of the nutrients that go to the gulf of mexico
5819965 and so the size of the low oxygen zone has increased in proportion to these nutrients reaching the gulf
5819966 so these things will fall to the bottom and as they decompose they consume oxygen
5819967 the deeper we go down in the water it gets kind of scary because theres nothing there theres no fish theres no organisms alive so its just us
5819968 its dark and its turbid because all that algae that is dying thats sinking through the water column
5819969 you just gotta keep going miles and miles and miles and hopefully youll run into something
5819970 the fuel costs are so high its just not feasible to get out there unless you can catch a boatload really make any money out of it
5819971 all my boats have to go somewhere else to make a living its a shame
5819972 this is the prime shrimping ground in the country right here and it shut us down it just shut us down its unreal
5819973 need to be prepared to deal with families who are waiting for a miracle
5819974 sensitivity to this belief will promote development of a trusting relationship
5819975 when youre a parent and youre standing over the body of your child who you think is dying you have to have that
5819976 i know that none of us are immune from anything
5819977 you cant say thats nonsense you have to respect that
5819978 its not that you dont want a miracle to happen its just that is not going to happen today with this patient

5819987 the study suggests that the critical ingredient in smoking that may be causing emphysema is cadmium a well known contaminant of cigarette smoke
5819988 the worry is if you are exposed to this cadmium through other sources you can also be at risk for emphysema
5819989 the big picture is we keep learning more about the contributions of environmental toxins to the chronic diseases of aging for which we never suspected an environmental cause
5819990 with a larger population we will be able to better disentangle the independent effects of cadmium and smoking and whether dietary cadmium or other non cigarette sources may also influence lung function
5819991 association between 24 hour urinary cadmium and pulmonary function among community exposed men the va normative aging study
5819992 climate is going to produce changes in ecological structure of all sorts of plants and animals around the world now as in the past the fossil record can help us understand how much or how little climate change is necessary to produce changes in ecosystems
5819993 we see quite a different ecological profile of the kinds of mammals that coexisted after this climate change than before
5819994 its clear that climate has had an impact on the ecological diversity of mammals in the area
5819995 this is the kind of study you can only do after youve been working in a place with a big team for 25 years or more because you need all the other basic data to be thoroughly resolved before you can even start to address the kinds of questions in this work weve been fortunate to have a team that found the various research topics so worthwhile and so interesting that they stuck with it for several decades and weve also been fortunate to receive funding for field work for that long
5819996 im going to have cute boobs till im 90 so theres that
5819997 ill have the best boobs in the nursing home ill be the envy of all the ladies around the bridge table
5819998 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
5819999 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
