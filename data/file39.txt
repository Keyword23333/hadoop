390000 yep and you said you could beat me she said kissing him
390001 well i thought i could he said kissing her neck
390002 what do we have here a voice said stepping out from beneath the trees
390003 now now i just want to say hello he said
390004 im zaire and its nice to meet you he said
390005 and if you dont mind me asking what a beautiful vampire likes yourself hanging around with aidan
390006 hmm no i was just wondering why someone like yourself would hang out with a loser like him when you could hang out with me he said

390012 im excited just about being out there and having all those people watching us practice
390013 after a summer of working out by yourself its great to see how much people care that makes me want to compete even harder
390014 im amazed that people have nothing better to do at 9 30 in the morning than watch practice
390015 i mean im glad to have people like that thats what makes college football so great its a pretty serious sacrifice to be out there when its this hot the payoff is to see guys run
390016 its a lot more organized and structured its exciting for us to get to practice because running sprints all summer is not that much fun
390017 we have a new play caller it doesnt mean we have a different offensive system we are going to have to learn about our team as well especially the new faces that will contribute
390018 its good to put a little pressure on them and see how they do
390019 they know whats going on its that time of year
390020 while were focused on making sure the services are there we dont want to let the other piece prevention slip
390021 we want to know what those underlying causes are that are leading people into homelessness in the first place
390022 theyre not the people you see walking up and down bell street
390023 it seems counterintuitive but its so much more cost effective to provide preventative services
390024 when we do that we save on resources such as emergency medical care and law enforcement help

390031 now i can tell everyone that yes i will sign a contract
390032 i never told anyone i would be leaving this club never ever im very happy weve found a solution
390033 i have three years left on my contract and im putting two or three years more so im very happy being part of this family
390034 when the boss and i started talking about my contract i never told him id be leaving this club and he knew my desire
390035 my desire was to stay at this club so for me hes like my father hes my boss so whatever he tells me ill do it
390036 our relationship at the moment is always strong there is no doubt about that
390037 the history of the social security debate has taught that too many specifics especially during a presidential campaign has polarized the debate
390038 sen mccain believes this is so important that we do not politicize this debate during an election season
390039 i would rather speak at a rally or a political gathering any place outside of the country after i am president of the united states
390040 but thats a judgment that sen obama and the american people will make
390041 they can only make a small difference at the margins
390042 it was as though he was running for an ohio senate seat
390043 we cant find any evidence in our recent polling that the vice president made a significant difference
390044 people ultimately see the promises and the voice coming from one person
390045 the choice can shape how a presidential nominee is perceived
390046 signaled what kind of a chief executive officer he was going to be
390047 he just looked worried depressed anxious way turned into himself
390048 it would be overstating it to say he looked like a guy who was being led to his execution but its not far off
390049 almost everybody believes that he had absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax
390050 oh yes i know the people of emc have tee time all right
390051 thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
390052 i was in union missouri which is 98 percent white a rural conservative city and what i said was what i think everybody knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
390053 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
390054 what this has become i think is a typical pattern from the mccain campaign whether its paris hilton or britney or this phony allegation that i wouldnt visit troops they seem to be focused on a negative campaign what i think our campaign wants to do is focus on the issues that matter to american families
390055 nobody really thinks that bush or mccain have a real answer for the challenges we face
390056 so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know hes risky
390057 youll hear from my opponent sen obama tomorrow and if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
390058 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
390059 i think we were perfectly within our rights to protect our candidate and to point out that were not going to lay down for these kinds of tactics
390060 this wasnt injecting race at all thats not the issue here at all and i dont understand why they seem to try to make something out of a thing that took place months ago
390061 he said it out in mississippi before an all white audience and nobody saw it as injecting race and so i think its a shame that a man that ive always considered to be very honorable seems to be running such a dishonorable campaign
390062 obama was anticipating you know that race will be an issue although john mccain has worked very very diligently to make sure that race is not the issue
390063 well let the chips fall where they may when it comes to how people perceive this but we are not going to let anybody paint john mccain whos fought his entire life for equal rights for everyone to be able to be painted as racist
390064 im sorry to say that it is its legitimate and theres no place in this campaign for that theres no place for it and we shouldnt be doing it
390065 whats happened is that sen mccain has made a decision that hes going to run 100 percent negative ads and you know why because hes trying to defend policies that are indefensible in our economy foreign policy
390066 this is not the john mccain that we expected in this campaign this is not the john mccain who ran in 2000
390067 barack obama never called john mccain a racist and in fact you know the quote that ricks referring to happened at a town hall meeting in a rural area of missouri not one newspaper reported it the way he accounts for it
390068 and now we see sen mccain saying hes proud of his britney spears paris hilton ad and its really a shame i think the country expected more
390069 he did not play any role he was not a soldier he was a driver
390070 his nature was more primitive bedouin person and far from civilization he was not fit to plan or execute
390071 as the american army we have drivers cooks crewmen and legal personal
390072 we also are human beings we have interests in life our people have wives and children and schools you can not understand terrorism and al qaeda from 9 11 operation
390073 one of the reasons for the success of the outside operations is the secrecy of the operations
390074 so many of bin ladens inner circles have no knowledge of what he was planning and so many of members and even the trainers at the military camps do not have any knowledge of the works of the outside cells that includes the civilian employees
390075 he was a driver and auto mechanic he was not at all a military man
390076 he is fit to change trucks tires change oil filters wash and clean cars and fasten cargo in pick up trucks
390077 i was personally responsible for transporting and getting out all families from afghanistan to pakistan
390078 im still totally convinced that we get the big man back he will add another dimension to our game
390079 when that whistle goes at bournemouth you will see players who have played in pre season play totally different because its that mad thing of three points and that little extra buzz that some players need
390080 hes a big loss because if you put in even a deep cross if you have someone of that stature you have a great chance of winning the first ball if you can do that then people like simeon jackson will read off that the midfield players will gamble and go forward
390081 we lacked that last year and we have lacked it in pre season but with him back it will give us that other little bit im looking for
390082 before dover i had in my head 10 we have just got to get this other one and if mark gets fit he will be the one if he doesnt then we may have to look somewhere else to get someone in on loan to do that job for us because we do need a physical presence up top like we have always said
390083 we have got mark some would say delroy facey who is still contracted to the club he could maybe stake a claim to become involved on saturday because other forwards probably didnt do as well as they would have liked to
390084 i think jackson will be a big goalscorer mark mccammon will get his fair share andrew crofts will pop up with a few adam miller has got enough about him to hit a ball and dennis oli should be looking to get a few goals
390085 i think we will be alright in that area we have just got to make sure the boys are not embarrassed to shoot
390086 i think john mccain has harmed himself in the last week really eroding any capital he had built up in terms of what kind of politician he is
390087 but hes really helped our campaign because so many of you have contributed in the last week our field offices had people pouring into them yesterday
390088 at a time when weve got bigger challenges than any time in our history and youre running ads with hillary and er with britney and ah paris in it i mean come on the american people deserve better
390089 barack hussein obama didnt sound like an anglo saxon name to him
390090 after 10 years of our play being on broadway why should we hire you annie has red hair and has always been well you know i just cant see you playing this role effectively
390091 look i know i dont look like the annies of the past but i want my performance to speak for itself
390092 i dont look like other presidents on a dollar bill
390093 the history of the social security debate has taught that too many specifics especially during a presidential campaign has polarized the debate
390094 sen mccain believes this is so important that we do not politicize this debate during an election season
390095 the reason why hes winning over a variety of voters from all ethnic backrounds and age groups is because hes running as the president of the united states not the president of the black community
390096 i know john mccain will win a lot of votes for his
390097 this is the kind of material that the mccain campaign should find the most startling no doubt it applies to more than this individual if this attitude towards the mccain mantra continues to spread it will surely cause a a roll down the hill towards defeat
390098 we have had great success in recruiting patients into the trial which is a testament to the promise of our approach and the efforts of our investigators
390099 since initiating this trial in june 2007 we have been delighted by the enthusiasm of the patients and clinical groups participating across the u s
390100 obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
390101 we are not sure whether the negative emotions expressed by viewers were related to their feelings about either candidate or about the way in which the message was delivered
390102 however we do know that the ad did not move voters and they expressed negative emotions after viewing the ad
390103 it is the responsibility of the people to vote the congress out of office for good we need action not talk
390104 we are giving our wealth to the middle east because we refuse to provide our own energy why because our congress represents the corporate state and not the people
390105 in fact every new promise that the new members of congress ran on to get elected remains exactly that an empty promise i have to laugh when i recall the self righteous finger waving of house speaker nancy pelosi and company now go on and enjoy your vacation you earned it
390106 we have all been wringing our hands about energy and our dependence on foreign oil for the past 30 years
390107 and we wonder why the public is cynical and the wrong track numbers are at an all time high
390108 members of congress and in this example i mean the majority have refused to take any action because it is easier to wait out the presidential election and then see what the climate is like because unfortunately for the people congress can choose to vote only when it is convenient to do so
390109 because there is nothing they can do for immediate energy prices and they have profound differences for the long term that are not easily reconcilable
390110 right now the publics anger at washington is mainly being taken out on the party of the president
390111 and its not likely that is going in change due to congresss failure to act during the august recess
390112 allowing offshore drilling will have no impact on gas prices its a drop in the bucket
390113 but the idea that this is a conspiracy by the big oil companies is wrong as well
390114 only three events watergate the iran hostage crisis and the economic downturn of 1992 have driven below 30 percent the number who think things are going well
390115 american drivers are counting on congress to lift the ban and so are american workers
390116 the low approval rating for democratic leaders in congress is not likely to put the partys control of congress in jeopardy
390117 there is no indication in any poll taken by any organization that voters want to see the gop regain control of congress and all generic ballot questions show a wide lead for democratic congressional candidates
390118 i told each and every one of them i believe we can win with you
390119 all of our coaches feel that way it is one of the strengths of our team
390120 its obvious that they were competing and working hard in the summer
390121 i went and watched all of those games when they happened and through the off season and tavita did improve very much over the course of the season
390122 unfortunately we didnt win as many games as we wanted and thats everybody thats why i said we need to be a stronger team we need to be a better coached team we need to coach the fundamentals and the techniques better but tavita pritchard improved
390123 im not in such a hurry to make a decision just because i feel like we have three guys who can win games
390124 its one thing to say that we have two guys or three guys that were not sure are good enough thats one you want to get resolved because that guy needs the most amount of reps to get better we feel good about all three guys

390164 malaysia will have to study if the matter is intimidating
390165 we have missed this opportunity and anwar will be more cautious now to go for public debates which he is only comfortable when the audience consist thousands of his party supporters and sympathisers
390166 i am more inclined to believe that malaysias inflation rate is anywhere between 10 to 15 rather then the quoted 7 7
390167 once bnm increases the ir then banks cof would have to go up correspondingly blr would trend upwards too with slowing consumption higher inflation less business activities could the gdp still achieve the 5 target

390176 pada pemilihan umno akan datang presiden datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi akan menang tidak akan ada siapa yang boleh tanding presiden kerana tiada siapa yang boleh memperoleh 60 pencalonan
390177 ini dikawal oleh presiden seperti yang berlaku dulu tengku razaleigh hendak lawan beliau cuma mendapat satu sahaja bahagian beliau yang mencalonkan beliau bahagian beliau sendiri mencalonkan beliau
390178 saya tak setuju lama sangat tahun 2010 tak ada masa untuk memulihkan parti untuk pilihan raya akan datang

390194 tindakan bpr memulakan siasatan ke atas teck lee tiada kaitan sama sekali dengan pengumuman presiden sapp itu dua hari lalu bahawa beliau hilang keyakinan terhadap kepimpinan perdana menteri datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi
390195 itu cuma satu kebetulan kerana perkara itu dakwaan rasuah rm5 juta baru disebut di mahkamah jadi kita kena menyiasat itu suatu perkara baru bagi bpr dahulu siasatan kita tumpukan kepada sudut lain kita tidak pernah mendengar mengenainya sebelum ini
390196 pada minda yang bukan legalistik ini afidavit adalah public document setelah difailkan di mahkamah tak tau le kalau undang undang uk sangat berlainan dengan malaysia dimana afidavit adalah document rahsia besar top secret

390207 kedudukan najib pada masa ini cukup selesa iaitu hanya menunggu proses peralihan kuasa berlaku dan haluan perjalanan politik najib berbeza dengan anwar
390208 anwar sekarang berada dalam keadaan buntu dan terdesak dia kata sebanyak 30 anggota parlimen barisan nasional bn akan lompat parti sedangkan dakwaan itu tidak berlaku
390209 bulan september semakin hampir dan peluang anwar untuk menjadi perdana menteri kini semakin samar kerana strateginya untuk menarik ahli parlimen bn menyertai pembangkang tidak menjadi katanya
390210 if we count we will find that all the 10 judges who heard the case of anwar sodomising azizan abu bakar his former family driver agreed that anwar committed sodomy although the two judges used technical reasons to not find him guilty
390211 australias remarkable performance is not because of the john howard government indeed it may be despite it
390212 there you go i know you wanted to test the response on that
390213 ive ridden him in his last three starts and hes felt better each time
390214 he stepped up to 1200 metres for the first time for me today and i really thought he appreciated the extra trip
390215 ive got two horses in work but im getting another one soon
390216 i used to be a grazier but i havent been doing anything lately except train my two horses
390217 this bloke has done a good job over the last three weeks he won well at eagle farm then he was very unlucky when second here last run and he deserves to have a month off now
390218 hes a tough horse and i dont need to do much with him after his races
390219 i started at 56 kilos on monday and still woke up this morning at 54 kilos and had to lose another kilogram in the sweat baths this morning
390220 all i had to eat yesterday was an orange and for dinner i had brown rice some veges and tuna
390221 i walked every morning for 45 minutes then ran for 15 minutes and did 15 minute sessions on the punching bag and skipping in the gym
390222 weekend hussler has obviously got the scores on the board with the group ones last time in but at this stage he doesnt scare me
390223 he light fantastic has come back a lot better horse
390224 i think he is the best horse in australia he is the best horse i have ever sat on and the horse is flying
390225 the thing i really like about him in his work now is that you sit five or six lengths off them and he doesnt touch the bridle
390226 he is quite happy to just saunter along until you put him within a competitive range
390227 get about a length and half off them and it is like sitting on two different horses you can feel him starting to tighten up and pick up underneath you
390228 obviously light fantastic was travelling better in the gallop but the other horse alamosa is a funny horse
390229 he improves each furlong 200m but he is never a flash worker
390230 i think he alamosa looked a bit tubby but he will probably run in the liston
390231 i knew he would be coming and i wanted to give him something to chase to give him a hitout
390232 he seemed to take it in his stride and he had a good blow afterwards but that is what he needed
390233 it is just a matter of going back up the country to be more competitive
390234 i am as strong as ever and i hope i am riding as good as ever and that i can still improve

390241 tuhan tidak akan mengubah nasib sesuatu kaum kecuali kaum itu mengubah apa yang ada dalam dirinya kalau sanubari kita penuh dengan ketakutan kita akan hidup dalam ketakutan kalau kita nyalakan api perjuangan dalam dada kita kita akan memiliki kekuatan untuk menegak keadilan menghapus kezaliman kita perlu kekuatan untuk membentras rasuah kita perlu kekuatan untuk menentang nepotisme rasuah kezaliman dan penganiayaan
390242 kita perlu memerdekakan diri iaitu dari akhlak terkeji dari nafsu rakus untuk membolot kekayaan untuk diri peribadi keluarga dan suku sakat kita perlu merdeka dari sifat suka mengumpat mengeji dan menabur fitnah
390243 the price increases are beyond the governments control and the government has no resources nor capability to shield the countrys economy from the effects of the global phenomenon
390244 kira nasib pak lah tidak begitu baik dengan masalah sekarang ini berpunca daripada masalah lampau dan kebijaksanaan orang tertentu mengekploitasi masalah personal sama dengan masalah negara
390245 kita sayang pemimpin tetapi kita wajib lebih sayang parti agama bangsa dan negara
390246 the price increases are beyond the governments control and the government has no resources nor capability to shield the countrys economy from the effects of the global phenomenon
390247 as for msia i get depressed every time i read the newspaper am sad to realise that at this moment in time i am ashamed to be malaysian or to tell people i am one bad huh
390248 saya hairan dengan pernyataan seperti ini kemana pula hasil minyak sawit kita pengeluar terbesar dunia getah kita antara pengeluar utama dunia komponen elektrik dan elektronik kita antara pengeluar pembuat terbesar dunia dan lain lain lagi
390249 nasib seorang ahli politik banyak bergantung kepada orang suka kepada kita ataupun sebaliknya kedudukan dalam politik sentiasa bergantung kepada sokongan ahli politik tidak dapat berbuat apa apa tanpa sokongan inilah hakikatnya
390250 i assume on the presumption that some sort of a confrontation will take place between iran
390251 but even without this premise i remain a bull and i think we will take 150 out sooner rather than later
390252 saya yakin kita sedang menyaksikan ulangan kepada kaedah kaedah yang digunakan terhadap saya pada tahun 1998 apabila tuduhan palsu dibuat di bawah tekanan
390253 ini jelas berupa satu percubaan habis ikhtiar oleh barisan nasional untuk menyekat pergerakan rakyat malaysia ke arah kebebasan demokrasi dan keadilan
390254 this is clearly a desperate attempt by the barisan nasional regime to arrest the movement of the malaysian people towards freedom democracy and justice
390255 papa tahu dik sekarang ni kita tengah susah sabar ye

390268 sesiapa yang berjuang dengan nama allah dan niat baik sentiasa dalam keredaan allah tetapi siapa yang lupakan niat khianat dan tamak akan dimurkai allah akhirnya menjadi hina

390270 they were sort of going under the radar but its not a huge surprise

390272 the market is just there there are people desperate to get these vehicles

390291 bagi pemilik motosikal persendirian berkapasiti enjin sehingga 250cc bayaran tunai sebanyak rm150 setahun bagi setiap motosikal akan diberikan
390292 namun saya yakin para pembesar kanan umno seperti mohd najib abdul razak muhyiddin yassin tengku razaleigh hamzah dan rais yatim menyedari masalah ini dan mampu menanganinya jika diberikan tanggungjawab
390293 semua orang ingin menjadi ketua atau pemimpin kerana dengan menjadi ketua mereka punyai kuasa tapi tidak semua ketua benar benar mempunyai sifat sifat kepimpinan atau leadership ability
390294 hari ini oleh sebab kerajaan begitu lemah dan persepsi rakyat terhadapnya begitu negatif maka apa sahaja yang dilakukannya walaupun betul dan baik sekalipun akan dicurigai dan dipertikaikan
390295 if all the profits were handed over to the government i dont think petronas will survive longer than 10 years
390296 but if the government can ensure that this group does not pay more because of the rise in oil price and comes up with the best solution for them i am certain that there will not be any outcry
390297 eddy said i think if loud mouth shahrir had thought a bit more he could instruct that all petrol stations within 50 km of the johor causeway should allocate 50 of their pumps to be reserved for singapore cars to be filled and charged unsubsidised price for above 50km the petrol station could allocate say 20 of their pumps reserved for singapore foreign cars etc is that so difficult to do or the abdullah administration is more interested in pleasing rich singapore than to look at the plight of our rakyat
390298 although we in malaysia refer to pedra branca as pulau batu puteh that feature is actually not an island but merely a rock in the sea which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of its own
390299 makan dengan budak lauk habis hulu mandi dengan budak air keruh dulu tidur dengan budak kelambu putus dulu
390300 hari ini utusan malaysia melaporkan khairy sebagai barkata tol lebuh raya wajar dihapuskan terus atau dikurangkan apakah khairy sekadar membuat kenyataan kosong untuk mendapat sokongan atau dia tahu sesuatu yang kita tidak tahu
390301 bagi isu kenaikan harga minyak saya amat bersetuju dan ianya adalah langkah yang baik walaupun 41 kenaiakn agak terlalu tinggi
390302 the fuel price restructuring has enabled the government to save rm4 billion but when the crude oil price went up to as 138 54 a barrel rm450 25 on wednesday the saving was wiped out
390303 this is not the first time we are facing the challenge as we have overcome them and succeeded in spearheading progress
390304 this time around the people non government organisations and the opposition should assist the government by giving constructive proposals to solve the problem
390305 apa dah jadi dengan engin letrik lotus syarikat lotus di norfolk norwich ini siapa yang punya sebenarnya dalam hal ini kalau ikut hati kita hendak sangat timang timang mahaleel macam timan timang bola hari itu dengar dengar orang tanah besar tionghua berminat
390306 berkenaan dengan pedra branca seperti kata tan sri abdul kadir ia hanyalah batu semata mata sekiranya geologist kita dihantar untuk membuat kajian saya pasti batu itu adalah foundation kepada struktur yang lebih besar sebagai satu pengkalan untuk check and balance aktiviti singapore yang sentiasa di argui kerana kaitannya dengan israel
390307 kite mesti bersiap siap dan mengumpul semasa kite masih berkuasa untuk hari tua kite
390308 dengan itu marilah kita menghadapi bersama cabaran ini dengan daya tahan demi kebaikan negara dan generasi akan datang
390309 mohon ulasan dato tentang cadangan anwar ibrahim yang mahu menurunkan harga minyak serta merta
390310 mcmana nak ubah cara hidup pak menteri semua mewah elaun pun lumayan setakat bercakap boleh lah
390311 nampak gayanya selepas ni kena belajar balik makan ubi kayu daripada makan nasi sebab semua barang dah naik nasib juga ubi kayu tak naik harga juga kalau tak nak makan apa lagi
390312 no other prime minister in the world either in developed or developing countries employs such a hands on approach in managing the economy we can see therefore that it was not the exchange control measures per se that saved the country but the man dr mahathir mohamad himself
390313 when you create a problem u must be able to mitigate them
390314 to take a good look at themselves and it would not hurt us if you decided to quit we just dont want to see malaysia plunged into deeper economic trouble what done is done
390315 perkara yang membuatkan saya sakit hati teramat kepada pak lah apabila dia meminta rakyat supaya tukar cara hidup
390316 but fear by far is the biggest driver right now
390317 if i may add is that our car prices are one of the highest in the world as well and thus we are already footing for the subsidy via taxes on cars not to mention we are subsidising the ap kings as well so they can get rich well you know they need all the help they can get while the rakyat need to learn to stand on their own 2 feet
390318 jikalau rakyat malaysia dikatakan patut membayar harga petrol pada harga dunia sewajarnya juga kita membayar kereta pilihan hati pada kadar harga dunia
390319 as we know other countries are coping desperately too with the inflation and the rising food transportation housing costs
390320 when singaporeans are not coming their income will be affected the minister concerned is already
390321 our observations suggest that in contrast to general belief the limits of human cognitive function may extend far beyond the range that is currently enjoyed by most individuals
390322 she was very enthusiastic about her being important for science
390323 1 menjimatkan perbelanjaaan dengan memotong elaun menteri tidak semestinya baik untuk ekonomi malah mungkin membuat ekonomi lebih parah
390324 kami menjangkakan harga minyak mentah akan naik sehingga as 250 rm815 setong dalam masa beberapa tahun ini
390325 y bhg tun sebelum pru12 lagi orang kampung di pokok sena telahpun memperkatakan monorel di pulau pinang dan rapid penang adalah untuk anak pak lah kamaluddin menerusi scomi saya orang kampung pun tahu rapid penang dan monorel ini ada kaitan dengan kenaikan harga minyak dan pengurangan subsidi minyak pada tahun lepas selepas pak lah mengumumkan kenaikan harga minyak dan menyatakan subsidi minyak sebanyak 4 billion akan digunakan untuk memperbaiki sistem pengangkutan awam dan lalulintas tak lama kemudian ujudlah rapid penang dan monorel di pulau pinang mungkinkah wang subsidi ini digunakan untuk membiyaai rapid kl rapid penang dan monorel yang jelasnya pak lah ada berkata pengangkutan awam akan diperbaiki secepat mungkin dan disubsidi dalam pelbagai bentuk sesudah itu terdedah pula yang mendapat kontrak monorel adalah scomi keluarlah statement di utusan malaysia rapid penang akan menambah bas bas baru dan moden untuk keselesaan rakyat dan hari ini barulah terdedah bahawa bas bas ini dibekalkan oleh scomi yang dimiliki anak pak lah kita jangan terkejut selepas ini mungkin subsidi berbentuk penghapusan pengurangan duti import keatas bas dan komponen komponennya pengurangan cukai subsidi terus kepada rapid dan macam macam lagi atas alasan pengangkutan awam dan masa itu kamaluddin sudah untung berbillion ringgit dan inilah kenyataannya bahawa kenaikan harga minyak baru baru ini 78 sen dan rm1 bukan hanya isu minyak global tetapi ujud seolah olah unsur konspirasi pemerintah dalam perdagangan di dada akhbar dan tv arus perdana pm dan pak menteri yang berkaitan begitu asyik menyatakan pengangkutan awam akan diperbaiki untuk rakyat kerana ianya adalah salah satu penyelesaian mengurangkan beban rakyat akibat kenaikan harga minyak dan harga barang saya amat bimbang isu harga minyak global sekadar wayang rakyat sebagai kambing hitam dan pengembalanya kamaluddin pak lah adalah director yang cukup berbahaya untuk rakyat malaysia
390326 antara percakapan awalnya ayah kenapa menteri kita tipu kata minyak petrol kita lebih murah dari indonesia walhal kat sana 6000 rupiah seliter tak sampai pun rm2 duit kita pun itupun baru dinaikan harganya
390327 the meeting had decided that a sort of reform is necessary through a new conference of the bretton woods to discuss changes to the imf in terms of governance and its roles and to hear the views and requirements of the developing countries and the need to create an early warning system before a crisis crops up
390328 the meeting had also resolved that more resources be used to implement country programmes and not to finance the administrative cost of the un and those of its agencies
390329 commonwealth countries will have to forge cooperation and alliances with other groups so that they too are able to feel the need to institute changes to global institutions
390330 otherwise the 3f problems fuel food and finance will continue to haunt the world and its population
390331 we will play our part to present a common stand
390332 our stand is that change is necessary i believe no one will object to that its the substance of the change that may become a subject for lengthy discussions
390333 it has been a good beginning we got the framework and substances to move forward
390334 those are the specialised working in the sector syariah experts as at 2007 figured around 120 in the whole country
390335 dulu dengar nak develop bahan bakar dari kepala sawit hangat2 tahi ayam ke atau dah berkubur projek tu apa salahnya develop tangki ngv supaya jadi kecil dan muat dlm boot kereta drpd yang ada sekarang makan ruang sangat lepas tu semua stesen minyak jual gas sebagai alternatif kalau murah dan mudah diperoleh orang akan guna
390336 firstly the manner in which oil is traded in the world market we need to remove the speculative traders investors that is pushing the oil price into unrealistic numbers weakening dollar is also contributing to the bloated transactions secondly we need to think again about proton this will involve in removing some of the policies that we have adopted as a way of adjustment to the current economic situation it will also mark a turning point to the initial agenda which need rethinking to adapt to the global economic climate
390337 mengenai bio fuel ianya bukan alternatif dari segi kos tetapi pilihan kearah mengurangkan co2 emission sahaja bagi kita di malaysia adalah masih lebih murah menggunakan fossil fuel
390338 sebenarnya semacam ada konspirasi tentang penggunaan dan pembangunan ngv ini di malaysia mungkin kita perlu bertanya kpd org2 yg di atas menara klcc itu yg lebih arif dan tahu mengapa mungkin bg petronas mengeksport gas asli lebih menguntungkan drpd kegunaan domestik kerana seorang rakan mengatakan penggunaan domestik ngv buat masa ini mengikis keuntungan petronas
390339 ada orang mencadangkan supaya kereta bertukar menggunakan gas tanpa mengetahui harga gas sebenarnya lebih mahal daripada minyak sebab itu tiada syarikat lain jual gas untuk kereta cuma petronas sahaja
390340 according to the experience of other nations the most practical fuels in addition to gasoline and diesel so far are only natural gas and lpg
390341 malaysia sudah sampai kepada satu tahap dimana sektor perindustrian sudah cukup canggih dan mampu mengeluarkan kereta sendiri
390342 apa salah makan ubi kayu saya tak berhenti makan ubi kayu dan daun ubi kayu ubi rebus dengan kelapa dan guna melaka sedap
390343 with the new model we are shifting our focus to individual customers this will be a real stepping stone to the consumer market
390344 its an especially significant day for american honda as we plant firm footsteps toward the mainstreaming of fuel cell cars
390345 theres no doubt that global inflationary pressures particularly rising food and oil prices have become the most significant challenge currently facing the global economy
390346 what we are seeing here is a once in a lifetime transformation in asia where hundreds of millions of people are moving up from very basic peasant lifestyles into lifestyles that are much more resource intensive like ours
390347 it is important for australia to put pressure on these other countries but of course we cant force them to make those changes
390348 kami sudah berbincang dengan kerajaan dua hari lalu dan bersetuju untuk mengeluarkan kereta ngv pertama negara pada oktober ini
390349 penggunaan ngv sudah diuji di proton dan kami sentiasa memastikan penggunaannya menepati peraturan selain dapat memberi kepuasan kepada pelanggan ujarnya
390350 jika kita memasang tangki ngv di luar pelanggan perlu membayar lebih dan tidak dapat menikmati pemotongan bayaran pendahuluan selain ia sebahagian daripada harga jual beli kenderaan proton ujarnya
390351 lotus terkenal dengan keupayaan enjinnya malah masih terlalu awal untuk kami memikirkan mengenai penggunaan teknologi hibrid di negara ini katanya anakbuah
390352 the public may have noticed that only petronas supplies natural gas for vehicle ngv for motor vehicles the amount is also limited
390353 but as soon as you get in that car it all goes away youre nervous until you sit down and strap in
390354 and you gotta always be thinking if you stop thinking for a second youve overshot the turn and that overshoots the next one and everything that youve gained youre about to lose it
390355 which appears to be a blog but lacks any kind of identification of the author other than perhaps a picture of her maybe im missing something whats it all about
390356 based in cullompton devon just up the road as it were from where my dad was born offering
390357 private consultancy in child development which provides treatment for cerebral palsy and children who suffer other development difficulties
390358 news pages seem to relate only to 2001 and 2002
390359 there will be a lot of people that will really be displaced
390360 the iraqi government is refusing any individual step to change the situation in kirkuk and it is considering it illegal and unconstitutional
390361 i genuinely believe in my heart of hearts with the way that i felt at the end of last season that i will come back this season
390362 ive trained through the summer and i genuinely feel ill be fine but until youve gone out there and done it it means nothing
390363 ive got to go and do the very best i can to stay at manchester united because thats the only place where i really want to play football
390364 i believe that when tun dr mahathir was the prime minister he did what was best for the nation similarly now that pak lah is the prime minister he will do his best for the country
390365 takut kehilangan jawatan menteri lebih menebal dari takut kehilangan parti
390366 lebih baik diherdik dan ditegur oleh orang cerdik dari dipuji dan disanjung oleh orang tidak cerdik
390367 orang yg tidak mahu mempelajari dari sejarah akan terus dihukum dengan melakukan kesilapan yg sama berulang ulang kali
390368 bagaimana datuk kalau kita pakai formula yang pernah dipakai di zaman kesultanan melaka dulu kita bawa semula pemimpin umno yang pernah dibuang oleh mahathir dulu dsai dan minta dia turunkan abdullah badawi
390369 seorang masuk seorang keluar macam hukum newton what goes up must come down
390370 kita sememangnya telah terlepas pandang kaedah terbaik untuk menguruskan media baru sebelum ini saya juga mengakui kita tidak terlalu arif akan kaedah untuk berhadapan dan meneutralkan tohmahan yang dilemparkan melalui teknologi baru
390371 lebih baik diherdik dan ditegur oleh orang cerdik dari dipuji dan disanjung oleh orang tidak cerdik
390372 jadi tolonglah dan cubalah paham kenapa pak lah bertindak sepertimana yang beliau lakukan sekarang masalah negara bukanlah priority beliau yang utama kerana negara tidak menyebelahi beliau semasa cuti sebatikal dulu tolonglah paham
390373 there are probably many umno members who wish to express their feelings but unfortunately they have been deprived of their rights by leaders who are more interested in their own position
390374 the silent protest by the party members is even more dangerous than open expression of opinion
390375 beliau tidak boleh diterima secara automatik sebagai anggota parti kerana mt perlu melihat rekod politiknya
390376 kalau dia orang baru dan tidak ada rekod mt tiada masalah untuk menerimanya tetapi kalau seseorang itu ada rekod atau misalnya pernah meninggalkan parti atau dipecat daripada parti lawan selepas itu nak masuk semula umno itu kena bawa kepada mt
390377 dalam perlembagaan parti mt ada kuasa untuk menerima atau menolak permohonannya
390378 tidak bermakna mereka masuk parti kita akan memecahbelahkan parti kita perlu lebih terbuka tetapi bagi saya yang penting ialah kemasukan ezam menunjukkan penting dan ikhlasnya perjuangan umno
390379 orang kurang jelas apa tujuan sebenar ezam tetapi kita tak mahu sangka buruk terserah kepada beliau sendiri
390380 daripada segi peraturan perlembagaan parti tiada sekatan atau halangan untuk seseorang menyertai umno
390381 cuma mungkin yang menjadi persoalan ialah kerana beliau pernah menjadi ahli umno kemudian keluar dan masuk parti lawan lepas itu masuk balik umno
390382 apa pun terserah kepada beliau sendiri kalau beliau ikhlas mahu membantu parti kita tak boleh tolak kalau beliau memenuhi syarat syarat perlembagaan parti kita tidak boleh menghalang kota kinabalu 29 mei umno perlu berlaku adil kepada semua ahli yang pernah dipecat atau dikenakan tindakan disiplin jika mereka ingin masuk semula ke dalam parti sama seperti bekas ketua angkatan muda parti keadilan rakyat pkr mohamad ezam mohd noor yang diterima tanpa syarat ketua umno bahagian kalabakan datuk abdul ghapur salleh berkata jika mohamad ezam sebelum ini pernah menentang umno dan diterima semula secara terbuka bekas bekas ahli lain yang ingin kembali ke pangkuan parti perlu diberi peluang sama umno perlu adil kepada semua ahlinya yang pernah dipecat atau dikenakan tindakan disiplin kita tidak mahu hanya kerana ezam bekas ketua pemuda pkr umno menerimanya semula kita berharap beliau ikhlas menyertai umno dan bukan kerana ada agenda peribadi umno adalah parti politik dan bukan parti main main bila bila masa boleh masuk dan keluar
390383 kemelut masyarakat dan negara ketika ini berpunca daripada rasuah dan penyelewengan
390384 international court of justice decides 12 to 4 that pulau batu puteh belong to singapore and 15 to 1 that middle rocks belongs to malaysia
390385 sekiranya malaysia menang perbicaraan di mahkamah pengadilan antarabangsa di bandar raya the hague belanda bagi mendapatkan pulau batu puteh puji pujian yang melimpah luah pastinyalah akan diberikan kepada perwakilan negara
390386 tetapi seandainya malaysia gagal pasti ada orang dan pihak yang akan berkata ia adalah kehendak takdir maka kita terima sahajalah menyalahkan takdir sudah menjadi amalan ramai pembesar di malaysia tanah runtuh salahkan takdir bangunan runtuh salahkan takdir mayat bergelimpangan di jalan raya salahkan takdir
390387 kalau malaysia menang dan kemenangan itu disebabkan pencapaian perwakilannya maka pastilah ada orang akan mendabik dada mengatakan bahawa malaysia mempunyai kemampuan minda yang hebat dan superior mengapa saya berkata begitu kerana dari sudut perwakilan singapura jelas mengemukakan sebuah pasukan peringkat tinggi yang cukup hebat manakala kita hanya menghantar perwakilan peringkat pegawai pasukan singapura mengikut laporan media diketuai oleh timbalan perdana menteri merangkap menteri penyelaras keselamatan nasional dan menteri undang undang prof s jayakumar dan dibantu oleh ketua hakim negara chan sek keong peguam negara chao hick tin dan duta bebas ambassador at large prof tommy koh mereka disokong pula oleh panel peguam antarabangsa yang terdiri daripada ian brownlie q c prof alain pellet rodman bundyn dan loretta malintoppi manakala pasukan malaysia dikepalai oleh duta bebas merangkap penasihat hal ehwal antarabangsa kepada perdana menteri abdul kadir mohamad yang juga berupa kepala delegasi malaysia bagi rundingan jambatan bengkok dengan singapura umum tentu tahu apa yang terjadi kepada rundingan berkenaan projek di wilayah malaysia sendiri terpaksa dibatalkan kerana kononnya ditentang dan diancam oleh singapura abdul kadir dibantu oleh duta malaysia ke belanda noor farida ariffin dan peguan negara abdul ghani patail dan disokong oleh panel perundangan antarabangsa terdiri daripada sir elihu lauterpacht dan james crawford kedua duanya profesor undang undang antarabangsa universiti cambridge nicolaas jan schrijver profesor undang undang awam dan antarabangsa universiti lieden belanda marcelo g kohen profesor undang undang antarabangsa institut pengajian antarabangsa geneva switzerland dan penelope nevill downing college universiti cambridge
390388 using us to get investors in and when investors came in they said you come to my park its cheaper
390389 the success should be credited to the smooth cooperation between the chinese and singaporean partners
390390 both sides will have to work hard to make it a real success not a window dressing exercise
390391 they are the ones who will decide if foreign investments will continue to come into the sip
390392 johor government did not claim ownership of the island of batu putih was the killer as the icj found that johors reply showed that it understood that it does not have sovereignity over pulau batu putih
390393 tindakan malaysia mendiamkan diri apabila singapura mengibarkan bendera di pulau batu puteh pemasangan alat komunikasi tentera pada 1977
390394 singapura sudah mempunyai hak kedaulatan ke atas pulau batu puteh sejak 1980 iaitu tarikh pertikaian kes itu bermula
390395 when the oil price rises too high we have no choice but to review the subsidy because we have reached a stage where the annual subsidy for oil gas and other essential items has exceeded the allocation for development
390396 if we can maintain the prices of food the people will not feel the pinch too much
390397 the caliph misappropriated it from me but i have no proof so let the caliph take a solemn oath
390398 the garden is mine al mahdi purchased it for me but i find no contract for it
390399 look at the land that so and so the general and so and so the merchant are disputing about and give the land to the general
390400 the proof has been established before me that the land belongs to the merchant i will not take it from him without proof
390401 by god besides whom there is no other god you will not take it from the merchant without right
390402 i have filled it by god with justice and my judges have begun to refuse me with the truth
390403 rakyat akan merasa jemu dan hampa dengan aliran politik yang penuh dengan pertelagahan di antara pemimpin seolah olah hidup rakyat umum mati mereka makanan dan minuman mereka hanyalah politik dan politiking sedangkan kebajikan dan kesejahteraan serta kemajuan rakyat semakin terpinggir atau terbenam di dalam krisis politik itu rakyat telah merasa muak dan bosan dengan politik kita yang tidak beretika dan bermoral ini mereka mahu satu penyelesaian politik secara baik agar isu isu kehidupan rakyat pula akan mengambil agenda utama yang dibincangkan oleh para pemimpin politik mereka
390404 pertama sekali kerana ialah kelemahan kita dari segi pentadbiran dan surat setiausaha kerajaan negeri pada 1953 kerajaan johor apabila ditanya oleh pihak singapura mengenai status pulau itu menjawab bahawa pulau itu bukan milik negeri itu ini yang menyebabkan mahkamah menjadikan surat itu sebagai hujah untuk mengesahkan bahawa johor sudah menyerahkan hak kedaulatan pulau itu kepada singapura malaysia tidak membuat tuntutan tetapi berusaha mengekalkan haknya singapura kemudian membuat tuntutan hasil usaha perbelanjaan komitmen dan sebagainya yang diberikan terhadap pulau itu selama ini tiba tiba keputusan memihak kepada singapura dengan kelebihan ia menguruskan dan mengendalikan pelbagai alat yang ada di pulau itu dan dibenarkan oleh malaysia tuntutannya berjaya ini yang menyebabkan saya berpandangan ia bukan keadaan sama menang tetapi terlepas sebuah pulau milik kita akibat kealpaan sendiri
390405 for me not only mohamad ezam can join umno but everyone with good knowledge and experience they can contribute to the party as well as the country
390406 look you favoured this man by delagating all duties to him so umno of aab has bought over me and i will character assassinate in their very own media
390407 the once close ties which ex pkr youth chief mohamad ezam md nor shared with anwar ibrahim has now been reduced to polite acknowledgment whenever the two meet at functions
390408 former umno president dr mahathir mohamad today announced that he was quitting umno with immediate effect and urged other members to emulate him
390409 he said he was quitting the party which he led for almost 22 years until handing over the reins to abdullah ahmad badawi in 2003 as a sign of no confidence in his successors leadership
390410 he also called on all umno ministers deputy ministers and all levels of party leaders to join him in leaving the party
390411 however he asked these members not to join any other party
390412 former prime minister tun dr mahathir mohamad announced monday at 12 35pm that he is quitting umno
390413 blow itu semuanya terletak pada ahli ahli umno sendiri untuk
390414 sebagai seorang ilmiawan saya amat hampa dan kecewa kerana pemikiran rakyat melayu terlalu simplistik dan mudah memuja tiada daya kritikal untuk menjangka memikir dan mengupas motif tindakan dr mahathir mereka mudah percaya bahawa dr mahathir bertindak untuk mempertahankan orang melayu bulat bulat
390415 pemimpin datang pemimpin pergi tapi umno mesti dipelihara manusia akan mati dan begitu juga dengan umno tapi ianya jangan cepat dimatikan
390416 saya percaya pergerakan pemuda umno akan sentiasa rasional dan arahan saya kepada mereka ialah terus berada dalam barisan yang kukuh sehingga arahan selanjutnya
390417 secara peribadi pergerakan pemuda umno akan memastikan kita akan sentiasa mempertahankan kepentingan parti dalam apa jua keadaan dan mengharapkan agar kemelut ini ditangani segera secara bijaksana katanya kepada utusan malaysia di sini hari ini
390418 lebih lebih lagi dalam keadaan kita semua sedang berusaha bersungguh sungguh membina semula parti dan menyuntik semangat di kalangan ahli ahli serta mengembalikan keyakinan serta sokongan rakyat kepada umno katanya
390419 from buy to hold to sell dump it quick its a sham
390420 tun tahu apa yang patut dilakukan untuk meneguhkan hak orang melayu
390421 kami sayang tun dan bangga kerana tun tampil mengambil tindakan untuk membela kita orang melayu
390422 pemimpin datang pemimpin pergi tapi umno mesti dipelihara manusia akan mati dan begitu juga dengan umno tapi ianya jangan cepat dimatikan
390423 dengan ini saya mendesak sekeras kerasnya agar datuk seri abdullah badawi meletakkan jawatan sebagai perdana menteri malaysia presiden umno dan pengerusi barisan nasional dengan segera
390424 beliau memberikan tempoh sebelum mesyuarat umno cawangan bermula julai depan untuk dsab meletakkan jawatan dan jika sekiranya tidak berlaku beliau tidak teragak agak mengubah pendiriannya yang terus kekal dalam umno
390425 tun bukan budak kecil yang tidak berakal untuk mengambil keputusan keluar daripada umno
390426 yg hangpa konon rakyat biasa yg konon mulia tak main najis politik tu apa yg hangpa lorat sgt hangpa tak cukup makan ka zaman tdm dulu masa org perit krisis ekonomi 1998 hangpa ada tgk ka mcm mana sengsara rakyat negara yg amik imf kita haram tak rasa pun
390427 mungkin inilah caranya tun m mahu menyucikan dosanya dan memohon maaf secara tersirat terhadap dsai dengan memberi mp mp umno beralih kpd parti dsai sekali gus melayakkan dsai menjadi pm pengorbanan tun m keluar umno dan menggalakan mp umnno keluar pastinya akan bersekutu dngn dsai
390428 jadi kalau tun m tolong dsai jadi pm takkan dsai tak boleh maaf kan tun tun pun hidup tak lama jd sempat la dia minta maaf kat dsai sedangkan nabi maafkan umat atas kesalahan lalu kesalahan itu pun berpunca hasutan kiri dan kanan pemimpin umno yg tak senang dgn dsai ketika era lalu
390429 the court finds that there is an appearance of impropriety when a reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would conclude that the judges impartiality might reasonably be questioned
390430 it is no consequence that the judge is not actually biased because our law and our judicial canons are not only concerned about fairness to individual litigants but are equally concerned with public confidence in the judiciary which confidence may be irreparably harmed if a case is allowed to proceed before a judge who appears to be tainted
390431 we hope the supreme court appoints someone to hear the case soon because there are a lot of critical matters to be decided we really want to get on with the cases so these young men can get on with their lives
390432 whatever ultimately happens concerning the judge this does not mean these cases go away
390433 it will just take longer to get them to trial however i may seek to have the decision overturned by taking a writ to the court of appeals
390434 he was one of the people who figured out early on in this effort to preserve french in louisiana that we had to pay attention to the vernacular the local variety and integrate that into the education process
390435 he really brought an awareness opened my eyes to the culture i lived in every day and took for granted
390436 as i said in his eulogy he was a linguistic colombo
390437 he was one of those people you would call if you didnt know something he would know or he would find out
390438 we will probably be crazy busy this evening and tomorrow
390439 i think were definitely going to see a lot of people coming in for it
390440 they really put it at a perfect time of year
390441 its the start of school and the beginning of the month and every little bit helps
390442 but the tax free weekend is definitely an added bonus
390443 i think itd be a good idea if they did this every year at this time
390444 tax free or not youd have seen me here today
390445 i was expecting it to be more than it was ive got three to do school shopping for and were on a budget but our house burned down earlier this year so were on a budget anyway
390446 everything else in the economy is going up everybody needs a little help
390447 that would be really nice but any little bit helps
390448 i even considered going to buy a new dishwasher even though mines still working
390449 they were waiting to come shop for tax free day
390450 it probably encourages you to go shopping and buy stuff you dont absolutely need
390451 my influence on every child i teach is lasting good and bad
390452 there was a lot of classroom management information about the first day of school
390453 at lsu or at any college you dont get to see the first day of school so its clammed my nerves a little bit
390454 im hoping to find people on board for the challenge
390455 im really hoping that young animators and film artists will be attracted to the project as the visual aspects of the show are so delicious
390456 not only will it be nice to go into a portfolio
390457 but its a chance to really push ones creative boundaries
390458 the music is full of stimulating imagery and hedwig isnt know for having limits
390459 islam does not distinguish between the american people and the american government since both are in a state of war with islam

390462 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas

390471 like i explained to him he only has to go out there when he feels good and good enough to where he feels like he can give us a chance to win with him being out there
390472 but if he doesnt feel like his body is going to allow that on a particular day all hes got to do is go to ozzie guillen
390473 i think he wanted me to know in case i didnt know not to expect what we were used to seeing out there
390474 thats the reason i said you only play when you feel great when you dont feel great or dont feel healthy thats ok we have plenty of options
390475 i told him that its not as if hes replacing the prototypical guy that was already out there
390476 listen im not trying to kid anybody about having all the answers
390477 if this works great home run if it doesnt its still a double well find a way to make it work and still have what he can give us offensively
390478 500 badges on the grille and dashboard signifying the limited production run and a certificate of authenticity indicating that the car was built especially for you the new owner

390482 it was a very funny radio show like a funny banter going back and forth and thats what came out of my mouth obviously im joking still i dont believe in what the t shirt said
390483 women whose husbands work long hours are more likely to quit their jobs yet mens careers are not impacted when their wives put in long hours
390484 this suggests a potential return to the separate spheres arrangement breadwinning men and homemaking women as long hours become increasingly common
390485 once upon a time a barbecue meant bangers and burgers but now people are more adventurous and want a range of dishes to serve
390486 i really dont think shes using drugs now being diagnosed with the early stage of emphysema was a real jolt to her a bit of a wake up call
390487 one can not overemphasize the adverse effects that climate change has on fundamental human rights such as the right to life shelter and a sustainable livelihood
390488 it is about direct action outside the camp we will break the law or do whatever needs to take place to stop e on peacefully from profiting from
390489 we are planning to shut the coal fired power station down and we are planning to come back when they create a new coal fired power station because we are the last generation that can do it and if we dont then there is no future for any of us
390490 this decision on kingsnorth is a political tipping point because if we dont say no to unabated coal here how can we say anything to china and india no one will respect the uks opinion
390491 i have never tell anyone that i will be leaving this club and today i am very happy that we find a solution and i will stay here
390492 as a student i feel very shocked to hear that many of the young growing youth are kidnapped by undergrounds i would like to request all the underground groups to free the children and give back to their own mothers
390493 we also fear of going to school and going here and there to buy things i dont like such things happening anymore in our state
390494 the need of the hour is to mobilize the people as a whole and to send a message to those groups who are lifting these children not to do such acts and not to repeat such unwanted things in future
390495 we cannot afford to lose the battle against ideologies of hatred
390496 the challenges of terrorism must be overcome in order for us to realise the potential of greater regional integration greater economic integration
390497 this terrorism is certainly one of the issues which for us is a very important part of the issues in the summit
390498 if we want to carry the saarcs economic and social agenda forward its essential that we manage to do this in an atmosphere free of violence
390499 we are organizing this to show our solidarity and support with our tibetans inside tibet who are facing lot of problems under the chinese government rule
390500 this the only thing that we can do because our tibet is a spiritual land so we cannot do such kinds of terrorist things this is the only thing we can do like hunger strikes peaceful march candlelight and sending news to any kind newspaper we cannot do anything more than prayers and requesting all international communities
390501 and all the roads we have to walk are winding

390520 i saw friends dying all around me with things left undone i didnt want to be one of them
390521 we were all in the festival that year r h thomson terry tweed robert charlebois it was amazing
390522 they had mounted hugh leonards play a life with an all american and british cast
390523 and they were going to take it to new york but one of the young men wasnt any good and director peter coe remembered me from the previous year so they flew me in and i got the part
390524 this was going to be the first summer i didnt have to run a theatre
390525 ive never done a piece like this theres very little text just voice over mixed in with the movement morris is truly in phenomenal form at the end of every days rehearsal theres been applause from the actors to salute him for the work weve done that day man that never happens
390526 its about ahab and his obsession its an insane spiritual journey he chases himself trying to kill what he hates in himself and it drives him crazy
390527 i wanted to find a way to honour that in 2008
390528 the devil is not some creature from the black lagoon he has a humanity that he gave up to go to the dark side he is a man with longings and feelings
390529 i mean there is always a concern about the safety to the community and to the firefighters and emergency personnel who have to respond to these but this one the other night put someones life in jeopardy
390530 he wont be here when i get married when i have my first child graduation
390531 i will miss his jokes his laugh his smile his voice
390532 within my district over 40 percent of the entire nations cargo is unloaded tracked scanned tagged loaded and transported through our communities
390533 while it stimulates the local economy it comes with a tremendous price to congestion on highways air quality and the lifespan of our aging infrastructure
390534 they have to learn to hunt because theyre predators who prey on fish the fish dont just swim up to them to eat the young ones have a trial and error period and if theyre not successful they can starve
390535 he just came in emaciated and hes got some kind of soft tissue damage to one of his wings
390536 thats always the problem with any predatory animal its amazing how they come along we do have band returns on birds that have lived so we know some do
390537 assuming they need to be taught to hunt and i dont know if they do then one would question how humane it is to put them out without it
390538 they might just need to build their strength and then theyll know what to do but its counterintuitive not to train them
390539 i am concerned about the potential inappropriate use of taxpayers money
390540 a process should be in place to ensure that all current and future board members are aware of all the guidelines that directly relate to them
390541 when expenditures are incurred for which the business purpose may not be self evident a more detailed explanation should be included with the supporting documentation
390542 when we got the audit we did make changes to the travel and expense policy of the board
390543 we made some internal changes for the senior management people mainly surrounding documentation
390544 im not sure id say a corporate culture of frugality is the expression but a corporate culture of accountability
390545 there is clearly a focus on being more efficient and trying to be accountable to the people of canada absolutely
390546 the minister when he took office he made sure crown corporations under his watch would show accountability and taxpayers dollars would be well invested
390547 the conservative government has delivered on its promise to clean up government unlike the past liberal government
390548 the minister takes action and at the end of the day theres a replacement at the helm of this crown corporation
390549 theres no doubt about the importance of having good access to information law that we can rely on
390550 i used to write songs all the time it was fun and i never performed
390551 now all the eyes are on the stage all these cameras are pointed my way and it takes a toll
390552 it becomes hard to write without thinking about those people out there and what they want to hear instead of the song and what i need to say thats why i dont do interviews its a matter of balance
390553 i was into the boarding culture but surfing isnt the only thing i know the songs i write are conversations with myself theyre about things other than the ocean and water and i think surfers appreciate that the music isnt about the surfing culture its about what we all think about when were out there in the water
390554 its a way of bringing lots of small scale ideas up front and encouraging individuals to change the way they think about the environment it all seems logical to me
390555 im learning as i go my father is a very hands on person if something was broken hed fix it the only thing fame is good for is shining a light on something other than myself
390556 we have water stations without bottles on the concert site to lessen the use of plastic and we encourage carpooling to our shows

390566 they have luka modric david bentley dimitar berbatov then the left back gareth bale comes on and hes worth 12m
390567 its easy for them to progress when they have money to spend we dont have that money and we have to do our best with what weve got and make players better
390568 what are our limits do you get half a bentley a quarter of bentley do we get bentleys right leg
390569 if you said to juande ramos to get rid of all his top players and give him x amount and say get to the champions league last eight he would just laugh at you
390570 we know that its nothing new and were not complaining
390571 es gibt interessen die man in jedem prozess verfolgen muss und auch dann wenn es bei uns innenpolitische ver nderungen gibt ndern diese nichts an den bedrohungen und nichts an den interessen und unserer pflicht sie zu vertreten
390572 im gymnasium lernte ich die sharia das islamische recht 1996 ich war gerade 18 wurde ich von den israelischen verteidigungsstreitkr ften verhaftet weil ich der vorsitzende der islamischen gesellschaft in meinem gymnasium war es ist eine art jugendbewegung der organisation damit begann mein erweckungsprozess bis dahin kannte ich die hamas ber meinen vater der ein sehr bescheidenes und liebevolles leben f hrte zuerst bewunderte ich die organisation weil ich meinen vater so sehr bewunderte aber w hrend der 16 monate die ich im gef ngnis verbrachte war ich dem wahren gesicht der hamas ausgeliefert es ist eine negative organisation ganz einfach eine grunds tzlich b se organisation ich sa im gef ngnis von megiddo und verstand pl tzlich wer die wirkliche hamas war ihre f hrer im gef ngnis hatten bessere bedingungen so etwa das beste essen und auch mehr familienbesuche und handt cher f r die dusche diese leute haben keine moral keine integrit t aber sie sind nicht so dumm wie die fatah die am helllichten tag vor jedermanns augen stiehlt und sofort der korruption verd chtigt wird die leute von der hamas erhalten ihr geld auf unehrliche weise investieren es an geheimen orten und legen nach au en eine einfache lebensf hrung an den tag fr her oder sp ter verwenden sie das geld und legen die leute rein
390573 ich respektiere israel und bewundere es als staat ich bin gegen jede politik die zivilisten ermordet oder sie als mittel zum zweck missbraucht und ich verstehe dass israel das recht dazu hat sich selbst zu verteidigen wenn die pal stinenser keinen feind zum bek mpfen haben bek mpfen sie sich untereinander in etwa 20 jahren werden sie sich an das erinnern was ich ihnen sage der konflikt wird zwischen verschiedenen gruppierungen innerhalb der hamas stattfinden sie fangen schon jetzt an ber die kontrolle der finanzen zu streiten
390574 ihr juden solltet aufpassen ihr werdet nie niemals frieden mit der hamas haben der islam als die ideologie die sie leitet wird ihnen nicht erlauben ein friedensabkommen mit den juden zu schlie en sie glauben dass die berlieferung sagt dass der prophet mohammed gegen die juden gek mpft hat und man sie daher weiter bek mpfen muss bis zum tod sie m ssen rache an jedem nehmen der den propheten mohammed nicht akzeptiert hat wie die juden die im koran als affen und s hne von schweinen betrachtet werden sie sprechen in begriffen historischer rechte die ihnen genommen wurden in den augen der hamas widerspricht ein frieden mit israel der sharia und dem koran und die juden haben kein recht in pal stina zu bleiben

390585 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
390586 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
390587 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
390588 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
390589 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
390590 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college

390596 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
390597 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
390598 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
390599 we agreed that there were certain issues that were not going to allow us to get the necessary votes to get to 60 votes
390600 we believe that its critically important that any plan be balanced that it include serious conservation measures as well as additional production incentives
390601 this is exxons drilling agenda wrapped in a veneer of other energy policies
390602 i am hopeful this plan can begin to break the current legislative stalemate on the senate floor

390845 ces litiges existent dans les soci t s occidentales mais ils ne d g n rent pas en affrontements sanglants parce quils sont canalis s par les institutions et quils entrent t t ou tard dans le jeu politique
390846 mais je ne suis pas convaincu que les grandes entreprises peuvent
390847 le monde id al pour les citoyens est probablement un m lange dun maximum de libert s civiles et sociales et avec des libert s conomiques et cest la justice qui se doit de trancher jusquo cela peut aller entre les parties lorsquil y a des conflits
390848 il est certain quun futur r gime socialiste tiendrait compte de lenvironnement en d veloppement durable pour assurer un avenir la collectivit
390849 les grandes multinationales ont tabli une hi rarchie o il est impossible de monter et de senrichir moins d tre n riche
390850 simple question quelquun d j demand si le fait de constamment marteler tort que nous sommes des cobayes dans une grande conspiration mondiale
390851 des termes que la gauche r p te partout et sans arr t m me lorsque tous les faits montrent pourtant que la situation mondiale sam liore apr s des si cles de grandes mis res de malnutrition et de probl mes environnementaux beaucoup plus majeurs
390852 y a t il des effets possibles dun discours gauchiste sur le psych humain
390853 non ce nest pas certain comment prend on conscience dun danger environnemental comment d tecte t on un changement dans les mentalit s dans le sens dune plus grande sensibilit au sort de lenvironnement si ce nest en donnant aux citoyens et aux groupes la possibilit de se faire entendre dans la sph re publique
390854 or tous les r gimes socialistes jusqu ce jour ont repos sur une gestion centralis e de l conomie et de la soci t qui avait comme assise un programme id ologique strict tout citoyen qui s cartait de lid ologie dominante en y allant dune critique de lordre tabli sexposait une r primande s v re des peines demprisonnement et certaines poques la mort
390855 dans ces conditions toute catastrophe naturelle provoqu e par lhomme se trouve dissimul e au public sans que lon ne sache tr s bien qui il faut en imputer la responsabilit
390856 le d faut de la libert de parole est la premi re raison principale pour laquelle les r gimes socialistes nont jamais t capables dun v ritable pr occupation pour lenvironnement
390857 la seconde est le souci constant des r gimes socialistes dassurer une hausse des rendements de gonfler les chiffres de la production conomique de fa on montrer les vertus du socialisme et favoriser le bien tre dune population qui autrement pourrait regretter la perte des avantages reli s la libert
390858 dans ces conditions la protection des sites naturels devient tr s t t une pr occupation secondaire quil ne sert rien de brandir afin de freiner la tendance vers une production toujours plus forte
390859 les th oriciens du socialisme affirment que le parti socialiste doit affermir son pouvoir seulement apr s une r volution cela implique que les hommes qui se trouvent la t te du parti ne sont pas g n ralement des hommes droits et d mocrates mais des combattants qui se sont d j mis hors de toute l galit et qui ne reculent pas devant la violence pour faire pr valoir leur id ologie tous les l ments sont ainsi r unis pour que le r gime qui se met en place ne soit l gal et constitutionnel quen fa ade
390860 on ne parle pas de dictature du prol tariat pour rien un parti qui veut transformer la soci t en vue de la faire correspondre une doctrine sp cifique un type nouveau dhomme naccepte pas ni opposition ni jeu libre des forces sociales la d centralisation ne peut pas exister dans un r gime qui r serve les d cisions fondamentales une lite qui se pr tend clair e
390861 ces peuples sentaient que le centre imposait des freins injustifi s leur expression culturelle ainsi qu leur d veloppement conomique plus florissant que dans lensemble du pays
390862 comme ces peuples nont jamais pu disposer de tribune pour faire valoir leurs aspirations comme la solution qui a t pr f r e a longtemps t le statu quo et le refus du dialogue d s que la yougoslavie a paru affaiblie slov nes et croates se sont empress s de proclamer leur ind pendance
390863 il existe aussi louest des milosevic des l nine des staline et des mao potentiels seulement le syst me de partis ne leur permet pas daspirer un poste de commande
390864 le marxisme se doit de reconna tre la science et le constat quant au r chauffement climatique est scientifique le climat politique des ann es 1900 1917 en russie est m me parsem de science naturelle laquelle est bien entendu remise en question par les conservateurs et les lib raux le marxisme est s v re critique et se doit de reconna tre la science sinon moi m me je fiche le camp du parti
390865 encore de la d magogie et une g n ralisation de la gauche tout en y m lant les impostures flagrantes
390866 foutaise simple affirmation simpliste et gratuite d nu e dargument cest de lordre de la pr somption
390867 elle tait tr s relative les russes manquaient de tout en raison du blocus inh rent la guerre froide de plus le conflit avec lallemagne nazie a grandement d truit le pays jusquaux portes de moscou
390868 m me chose pour le capitalisme fascisant le troisi me reich tait une dictature financ e par les grands industriels et financiers qui ont appuy ce despotisme afin de sassurer de conserver leur domination sur la soci t allemande
390869 seulement en raison des trentes glorieuses et de la prosp rit conomique
390870 le communisme est fond sur une doctrine qui se veut scientifique mais il est loin d tre assur quil sappuie r guli rement sur la science dans ses d cisions concr tes
390871 un peu avant la seconde guerre mondiale staline a fait le choix dacheter une certaine sorte de navires plut t que dautres jadmets avoir oubli les d tails ce choix tait mal avis et il a co t de lourdres pertes larm e sovi tique au cours de la guerre
390872 n anmoins une fois cette d cision prise elle a t pr sent e comme un choix patriotique et comme un choix qui allait dans le sens de lid ologie communiste toute opposition ce choix tait cons quemment pr sent e comme une d viance dordre id ologique
390873 cest quelque chose que jai remarqu souvent en lisant sur lunion sovi tique les d cisions qui taient prises ne d pendaient pas tant dune analyse rationnelle de la situation que dune lutte dinfluence entre les factions qui se disputaient la bienveillance du chef de l tat une fois la d cision prise elle tait aussit t pr sent e comme une partie int grante de la r volution et de lid ologie communiste
390874 aussi bien quen allemagne nazie on a tent de mettre en place une science qui soit sp cifiquement communiste comme sil y avait plus dun r sultat auquel la science pouvait parvenir c tait une fa on d guis e dassurer la conformit au sein des rangs du parti
390875 ceci dit loppos de certains je ne crois pas que lon puisse dissocier si facilement le socialisme comme mouvement du visage qui a t le sien sous le r gne de staline pour plusieurs motifs
390876 dabord les m thodes qui ont t utilis es par staline avaient d j t employ es avant lui par trotski et l nine
390877 les dirigeants sovi tiques avant que staline acc de au pouvoir avaient d j fait preuve dune brutalit grande chelle contre les opposants politiques
390878 et ils avaient voqu la n cessit de l limination des adversaires de classe pour asseoir d finitivement le r gime socialiste
390879 avant que lemprise de staline soit compl te sur le parti les apparatchiks avaient eu le temps dapprouver les mesures prises pour sattaquer aux koulaks et affamer le peuple ukrainien
390880 deuxi me raison staline avait t un penseur bien en vue du socialisme et ses crits ses d cisions ont t prises dans le but tr s clair de faire pr valoir le socialisme comme mode de gouvernement des hommes si ces intentions ont conduit des abus immenses cest que la doctrine socialiste est trop vague ou que ces abus lui sont inh rents
390881 derni rement et jen reviens ce que jai dit plus t t sil a pu arriver au pouvoir cest que forc ment il existe une faille dans lorganisation politique du communisme qui donne acc s au pouvoir des individus d r gl s et sans scrupules
390882 centrales nucl aires mal entretenues et dangereuses produits agricoles dune qualit tr s inf rieure aux crit res occidentaux rivi res pollu es r ponse insuffisante la catastrophe de tchernobyl
390883 le bilan est extr mement sombre et vingt ans plus tard on en est encore r parer les abus pass s
390884 en occident les gouvernements ne bougent pas toujours mais ils sont soumis des pressions et d s que de ces pressions pourra d pendre lissue dune campagne lectorale assur ment il ne faudra pas longtemps avant que des mesures environnementales drastiques soient mises en oeuvre
390885 je pensais lallemagne de lest lurss et la yougoslavie des cas que je connais mieux pas cuba et le r gime cubain transparent il ny a pas si longtemps quil a fait arr ter plusieurs activistes dont le seul crime tait davoir critiqu les d cisions du pouvoir
390886 sylvain guillemette 2 le communisme na pas couvert le monde entier mais il sest tendu sur la moiti de leurope et de lasie ainsi que sur plusieurs pays en afrique
390887 cela fait une tr s grande masse dhommes et si en effet il tait le mode de gouvernement le plus efficace qui soit connu il aurait su d passer le capitalisme et ne se serait pas effondr ainsi que cela sest produit
390888 il y a eu fa ade la constitution sovi tique promettait des lections libres et le respect des libert s individuelles on sait ce quil en est advenu
390889 dans lhistoire la centralisation a merg de deux facteurs sp cifiques la n cessit pour le parti de se regrouper autour dun cercle restreint pour vaincre ses ennemis par la force et lassociation de plus en plus troite entre lid ologie communiste et une lite dirigeante tant mieux si le pcq sorganise dune mani re plus d centralis e mais quelle garantie aurait on que le parti conserve la m me forme une fois port au pouvoir
390890 le r gime sovi tique sous staline ressemblait bien peu au parti socialiste de l nine
390891 une r volution peut elle tre r alis e de fa on pacifique
390892 cest une violence qui cr e des pressions sur le parti et le pousse dans le sens dune centralisation de ses effectifs
390893 est ce que cest vraiment une dictature du prol tariat le parti se r clame de la d fense des int r ts du prol tariat mais il a une existence autonome et il peut tout aussi bien prendre des d cisions qui vont dans le sens contraire des int r ts du prol tariat si son int r t le lui commande
390894 le prol tariat si tant est quil existe en r alit ny en a t il pas plusieurs na aucun moyen dexercer une pression sur le parti pour lobliger adopter des mesures sp cifiques
390895 je me permets dajouter avec un soup on de frivolit souriante que lopposition socialiste est absente des parlements nord am ricains parce que cette option na aucune prise sur lopinion publique de ces pays on voudrait tablir une censure quil manquerait de sujets pour le faire
390896 d magogue menteur pr somptueux je termine en ajoutant quil nest pas sp cialement agr able de discuter en votre compagnie et jose esp rer que cette attitude nindique pas trop le sort que le pcq entend r server la discussion libre et clair e des points de vue si tout hasard il est port au pouvoir un jour jadmets tout de m me quil est plaisant de se faire appeler par son pr nom la mani re de jean jacques cela sonne fier dirait gorki
390897 plusieurs ont d chant lorsquils ont constat lineptie et les d cisions peu rationnelles du r gime hitl rien en mati re d conomie
390898 aussi le degr dappui des industriels au r gime d pendait beaucoup de leur secteur dactivit ceux qui taient favoris s par le r gime industrie p troli re armement et industries connexes en particulier ont profit sans sourciller de la manne qui soffraient eux mais beaucoup dautres ont vite t m contents
390899 il est donc difficile de croire que la d mocratie ne puisse pas exister en temps dinstabilit ou quelles doivent chuter au prochain pisode de r cession
390900 les changes n taient pas rompus entre lest et louest
390901 si les destructions qui ont t inflig es lunion sovi tique ont t tr s r elles et tr s consid rables elles nont pas t plus grandes que celles que lallemagne a subies et pourtant dix ann es apr s la fin de la guerre on parlait d j dun miracle conomique allemand quon en tire les conclusions appropri es
390902 et socialisme le r gime de transition qui doit conduire vers le communisme
390903 comment lurss a pu b n ficier ce point du potentiel industriel allemand apr s le pilonnage des industries et la vague de destruction qui ont marqu linvasion de lallemagne par les russes et les alli es
390904 malgr ou cause de ces nouvelles mesures lam lioration conomique est tr s lente le point le plus noir de la grande d pression est atteint en 1933 mais l conomie montre encore tr s peu dam liorations vers la fin de la d cennie et demeure m diocre jusqu son remodelage en profondeur avec lentr e dans la seconde guerre mondiale
390905 et ils ne l taient pas au tout d but de la grande guerre tout loppos des populations civiles qui taient enthousiastes dans leur ensemble
390906 une soci t pauvre peut tre extr mement stable comme une soci t riche peut ne pas l tre l conomie nexplique pas tout
390907 i would say it was a fiasco and i would say it was as clueless of a staff as ive ever heard it was a complete joke
390908 to be a quarterback who has never played in that situation certainly was difficult

390955 we have nothing like these fields back home we really struggle for parks to play on the boys love this
390956 but the boys are doing well and drinking more water i think we should be okay
390957 there are boys back home who will never get a chance to play like this
390958 we played a team from mexico and they had different styles play its a total life change for these boys my hope is for them to appreciate this and take something forward from it
390959 its been a learning experience for them dealing with that and dealing with the referees back home theyre a bit more lenient on the physical game but the boys have gotten used to it and adapted to it
390960 it shows that everybody gets a shot in doesnt it

390963 the final score was 0 0 but this was the best game i have been involved in at the schwans usa cup this year
390964 both teams were enthusiastic and made excellent and determined attempts to produce a result end to end soccer prevailed as well as a considerable number of near misses and well saved shots
390965 injuries and the mental drain on a team playing in both tournaments makes winning tough
390966 we would warm up and get all pumped up then would have to go inside and sit for an hour

390972 i actually had to give them a curfew to make sure they get enough sleep
390973 they were just in awe staring up at the crowd
390974 most of them just started playing last year and we dont play in a regularly competitive league so this is really special the experience for them is 100
390975 just having your daughter be able to play in a tournament like this the experience is the main reason to come to the tournament to show the girls how huge the sport really is and to see what its like to play at an international level
390976 they take it very serious but they are having fun
390977 im proud to be a part of this tournament and im humbled by the overall size of it
390978 that was a huge one i dont remember the year exactly they were both great teams and they drew a big crowd
390979 that was back in the day and we didnt have any media so the word spread to watch this team there were about 450 people at the game and it was all word of mouth
390980 they beat a team from norway and their team was called the bruisers the level of play was nothing like it is now probably not even up to medal flight nowadays
390981 they traveled halfway around the world to play a team across town
390982 i always watch the u s national team on t v
390983 its really neat to hear her speak i think she is a real inspiration to the girls
390984 i came because i played in it and its close to my heart
390985 the girl players are lucky because not all tournaments especially in the midwest can give you that international experience or have college coaches watch you its such an experience meeting new people from different cultures people who play different types and styles of soccer you know coming into the tournament that it will be hard to win
390986 ive only been here an hour and ive been in the puma store you can try on different types of puma shoes talk to so many people its great
390987 i definitely want to come back and represent the u s

391081 dairy and other foods that are rich in calcium are thought to be important for the growth and strengthening of bones in children and adolescents
391082 in the us dairy products tend to be the preferred source of calcium since diets that exclude dairy are often deficient in this important nutrient
391083 the new findings show that for those children who have inadequate calcium intake increasing dietary calcium has a significant impact on bone development
391084 since most children dont get enough calcium meeting calcium recommendations may help to prevent future osteoporosis
391085 hes relieved but feels that it never should have come to this that cuban had withheld this money really out of spite and it was just unnecessary
391086 so while nelsons happy and relieved hes not happy that he had to go through this and that cuban would do this we consider it a pretty shameful episode
391087 the sad thing about the entire situation is that if nellie would have come to me and asked to get out of his contract so that he could coach the gs warriors i would have let him
391088 instead he lied about it all and it took a lawsuit to find out the facts
391089 what cuban did is try to justify taking away somebodys retirement money
391090 a lot of people are really worried is my lawyer really a lawyer

391095 it was exciting to find some of these ingredients because first of all theyre rare
391096 i didnt know some of these things can be grown here
391097 at the restaurant we highlight ingredients that are behind the culture
391098 everything hurts when im sitting in front of the television
391099 these gardeners are very picky very particular about their produce
391100 you can taste the love that went into what they grew
391101 clearly this guy knew he was wanted and we had the place surrounded and he was refusing to come out
391102 when we made entry he still had a gun right next to him it could have turned into a potentially deadly encounter
391103 some of the kids have never done anything like this
391104 you lose points if your bird flies off the table

391107 there were two things you did in the summer you went to the beach and you went to the fair
391108 this is their passion and allowing them to express it is so crucial
391109 if theres something thats more family oriented than 4 h i dont know what it is
391110 it brought my daughter and me together i get emotional talking about it
391111 everyone knows you come to the dmv to wait its sort of a foregone conclusion
391112 you get your little number thing and its like youre playing bingo at the dmv
391113 its insane there are people everywhere everywhere its like a concert in there without the music
391114 im trying to listen with one ear it would be horrible if they called my number and i didnt hear it because i was watching denise richards
391115 were trying to develop a vocabulary of what san jose will become
391116 a lot of companies are looking into ways to make electronic records easily transferable
391117 we are the first to do this but probably not the last
391118 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
391119 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
391120 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
391121 wow i cant believe it he seemed like such a nice guy a real hard worker
391122 he didnt necessarily have anything to do with the use of the cards
391123 thats shocking that he was an employee i guess they dont screen their employees good enough
391124 weve historically had such good rapport between our staff and our customers
391125 all my life i was making money playing poker shooting pool playing golf i always hustled
391126 the public gets the wrong impression young kids get into it they get trapped they lose all their money
391127 i was born and raised here i rode bikes to the creek when i was a kid
391128 we swam and hunted and fished thats all we did we didnt know anything about gangs or vandalism
391129 and somewhere along the way we managed to screw it all up and we became disconnected from our natural resources
391130 every minute i was inside playing i spent looking outside i never went back to school but my heart and love was always the outdoors now ive come full circle
391131 you say somebody used to be a gambler and people look at you funny you look for things is this person being straight with me hermans stories have always jibed
391132 this is grueling work you have long hard days you get wet and cold theres poison oak
391133 its hard to attract people and get them to stay hermans enthusiasm has never wavered
391134 herman was on his hands and knees with these children the entire time he had his cousin directing traffic with the parents there were at least 500 people there we ran out of pizza
391135 chris riggott is the only one out for any length of time probably another two or three weeks before he can start running
391136 its been a long haul for him to get back on the field for us
391137 he missed the first couple of preseason games so we wanted to get him through 45 minutes
391138 it was good to see him back out there were trying to nurse tuncay back after the summer so 45 minutes for both of them was perfect
391139 theres still a lot of work to do with a couple of weeks to go
391140 some people think sunderland is like the back of beyond
391141 i dont really mind where i live because most people would think i was brought up in the middle of nowhere anyway
391142 when i arrived at spurs three years ago i had a good feeling about how the club wanted to push on and i get that same feeling here now so im up for the challenge
391143 the momentum is starting to build and you have to take it step by step
391144 weve made some signings so its good to have that competition for places to help push the club forward
391145 i had a good chat with the manager before i signed and he gave me a good feeling that the club really wants to push on
391146 he told me about the new signings he had planned and convinced me this is the place to be
391147 i heard about sunderlands interest on the friday and by the saturday i was up here wanting to sign
391148 hes a really good player who works very hard and id rather play with him than against him
391149 its the same with el hadji diouf id much rather be playing with him than against him as well
391150 its helped to settle in having the other former spurs lads here but you soon get to know the others
391151 its funny robbie and i are good mates and two months ago we were playing on the same team
391152 but now were probably going to be facing each other on the opening day of the season
391153 i believe we can make the best electrode in the world and we hope to expand the sales to other manufacturers as well
391154 such fruits will be rejected and will not be permitted into the country

391159 i knew i could go all out because it was our last play in the series
391160 i think we know we have an opportunity to do something really really special to be a team to win back to back
391161 we also know what makes us good and its not hanging around and resting on our laurels we have guys who are self motivated
391162 we have definitely raised the bar with the way we played toward the end of the season last year
391163 winning the super bowl we set a higher standard for ourselves one play is not good enough we have to continue to strive for that excellence
391164 that helped us last year and it started before the season started with the team concept
391165 its easy to hand out t shirts and be superficial but i think this team took to those icons and allowed them to become our mentality and thats special
391166 we understand we are all driving toward the same goal
391167 you cant sit back and relax just winning the super bowl a lot of people are aiming for us and we have to prove ourselves again
391168 i dont see that ok we got what were looking for which is a goal sure because you get a chance to take care of your family but i dont see that
391169 what makes us good is the intensity and the effort thats what put us over the edge in our playoff run last season
391170 i dont think we have those types of guys who are resting on their laurels from last year
391171 why do so few people succeed when there is so much opportunity in the world

391217 during the visit of the syrian president who will meet with supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei and president mahmoud ahmadinejad the two sides will discuss tehrans nuclear issue
391218 negative consequences await if they dont have a positive response to our very generous incentives package and that would possibly come in the form of sanctions
391219 there is no evidence or information in this regard we have no reliable information
391220 we have seen the media report that al zawahiri was killed or wounded in the july 28 strike we are investigating the authenticity of the report
391221 and we checked it but we have not been able to confirm it
391222 is aware of and has been monitoring for a few days now reports that ayman al zawahiri has been killed or severely injured in the strike
391223 the party should have appreciated that as speaker i did not represent it nor could it at all give any direction to me with regard to the discharge of my functions as speaker i reiterate this with all the emphasis at my command
391224 i was informed that the party had not even discussed any matter concerning me on the morning of july 9 the general secretary on telephone conveyed that a section of the party felt that my continuance as speaker may be untenable however it was stated that the final decision would be taken by me
391225 in the computation of the strength of either the ruling party or its allies or of the opposition no responsible person or authority can treat the speaker as belonging to or extending support either to the government or its allies or to the opposition thus the question of the speaker withdrawing support to the government can never arise it is only the house as a whole which can decide whether the speaker should continue to remain as such or not apart from his her own decision to relinquish if there is any such occasion
391226 in view of the controversies that are now being raised based on a partys contention that while as speaker an mp should continue to be under the direction and control of the party a convention should start now that during his her tenure as speaker a member should temporarily resign from the membership of the party and not face a situation which compromises the position of the speaker vis vis the party
391227 i want to thank my family my legal team my medical team and all the people who have supported me at belmarsh whitemoor and manchester prisons and all my supporters
391228 no nation can survive without independence many people sacrifice their personal interests and even their lives to maintain the independence of their country
391229 our estimation is that already by 2009 iran will reach enrichment capability and as soon as 2010 will have option to reach uranium production at military levels

391235 the tags primarily consist of naturally occurring pollen a substance that evolution has provided with extraordinary adhesive properties
391236 it has been given a unique chemical signature by coating it with titanium oxide zirconia silica or a mixture of other oxides the precise composition of this coating can be varied subtly from one batch of cartridges to another enabling a firm connection to be made between a particular fired cartridge and its user
391237 were currently focusing on understanding the precise requirements of the police and cartridge manufacturers
391238 but our work clearly could make a valuable contribution not only to solving gun crime but also to deterring criminals from resorting to the use of firearms in the first place
391239 it is amazing we can see the strained yet still ordered interface structure that opens up a wide pathway for ions to be conducted
391240 the new layered material solves this problem by combining two materials with very different crystal structures the mismatch triggers a distortion of the atomic arrangement at their interface and creates a pathway through which ions can easily travel
391241 rather than forcing the ions to jump from hole to hole the new material has lots of vacant spaces to be occupied so the ions can travel much more quickly
391242 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
391243 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
391244 imaging with coherent x rays will be a key technique for developing nanoscience and nanotechnology and massively parallel holography will be an enabling tool in this quest
391245 once upon a time a barbecue meant bangers and burgers but now people are more adventurous and want a range of dishes to serve
391246 king prawns are popular because they are more unusual and also a light and healthy option another reason for why they have become so fashionable is because they are quick and easy to cook
391247 as a student i feel very shocked to hear that many of the young growing youth are kidnapped by undergrounds i would like to request all the underground groups to free the children and give back to their own mothers
391248 we also fear of going to school and going here and there to buy things
391249 the need of the hour is to mobilize the people as a whole and to send a message to those groups who are lifting these children not to do such acts and not to repeat such unwanted things in future
391250 information of this attack was shared very late with pakistan this was a case where the u s did not want to alert the pakistanis in advance because of concerns over information leaks
391251 the freedom of an editor to publish or telecast any news item cannot be subject to the approval or disapproval of a political party
391252 in the instant case the editor of cnn ibn has made it oublic that the investigation into the bribery case is incomplete and only if all the facts are authenticated the channel would telecast the tapes
391253 we are satisfied with the works they have been executed as per the world bank award
391254 the project is now almost near completion and any adverse comment would have delayed its execution
391255 it was a very funny radio show like a funny banter going back and forth and thats what came out of my mouth obviously im joking still i dont believe in what the t shirt said
391256 i didnt say sorry i sent her some information and i sent her a letter from peta saying how the meat industry is horrible for the environment horrible for your health
391257 i dont know what her intentions were but she definitely wanted to be photographed in that t shirt and i thought you know put a smarter t shirt on
391258 were used to scouting in all sorts of weird and wonderful places but football crowds are a new concept for us
391259 we typically take into account a whole range of aspects from the symmetry of a persons features to the glossiness of their hair
391260 we might need to start scouring the stands at anfield to find our next big name
391261 we found the imprint in clay remarkably well preserved of a seal with the name of gedaliah the son of pashur
391262 how absolutely fantastic and special this find is can only be realised when you hold in your hand this magnificent one centimetre piece of clay and know that it survived 2600 years in the debris of the destruction and came to us complete and in perfect condition
391263 the letters are in ancient hebrew and are very clearly preserved
391264 it is not very often that such a discovery happens in which real figures of the past shake off the dust of history and so vividly revive the stories of the bible
391265 women whose husbands work long hours are more likely to quit their jobs yet mens careers are not impacted when their wives put in long hours
391266 this suggests a potential return to the separate spheres arrangement breadwinning men and homemaking women as long hours become increasingly common
391267 i really dont think shes using drugs now being diagnosed with the early stage of emphysema was a real jolt to her a bit of a wake up call
391268 shes got a constant p a by her side a minder plus theres a security guard watching her i think things are really beginning to take shape to the good
391269 however the party has kept open the alternative of a majority government by making alliance with a few parties if a consensus government failed to take shape
391270 not going to university did give me an incredible driving force because it leaves you with a slight chip on your shoulder it makes me feel i am going to read absolutely everything so i can prove that i am not stupid
391271 its downright sad that on a day when we learned that 51 000 americans lost their jobs a candidate for the presidency is spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
391272 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4

391276 india is consistent in demanding a clean and unconditional exemption to resume nuclear commerce with nsg member countries once the exemptions are granted new delhi will work on specific detailed agreements with individual countries inter governmental or otherwise before placing contracts for nuclear materials equipment and reactors
391277 india will do its best to move forward with the next steps for implementing the nuclear initiative
391278 i am delighted to hear that the iaea board of governors has decided by consensus to approve the india specific safeguards agreement this is an important for india and for civil nuclear initiative for the resumption of indias cooperation with our friends abroad
391279 as we move forward towards our goal of sustainable development and energy security the peaceful uses of atomic energy will play an increasingly important role
391280 we look forward to working with him and his agency in implementing this agreement i am deeply appreciative of the historic significance of this milestone in our cooperation with the iaea and the international community in peaceful uses of atomic energy
391281 but the rapid changes in myopia prevalence are not consistent with a simple genetic determination since gene pools do not change sufficiently fast
391282 the crucial factor was being outdoors time spent outdoors as a protective factor now appears to be the strongest environmental factor that has yet been documented
391283 in countries with low prevalence of initial multi drug resistance the standardized treatment regimens for new case appear to be adequate
391284 however in countries where the prevalence of initial drug resistance exceeds three percent we believe it is urgent to strengthen capacity to perform drug sensitivity testing or to re evaluate these standard treatment regimens given the unacceptably high rates of failure and relapse
391285 we hypothesized that in countries using standardized initial and retreatment regimens the proportion of patients with poor treatment outcomes would be correlated with prevalence of initial and acquired multi drug resistance
391286 this is striking evidence that mdr tb is directly linked to the increased failure rates of our current treatment regimens
391287 in the short term the higher the failure and relapse rates mean greater morbidity and mortality for patients with greater social and economic harm for their families and communities in the long term these standardized regimens may be contributing to amplification of multi drug resistance in these countries
391288 unless those with the responsibility to boost control and research efforts increase their commitments and their financial investments by several fold we may never see elimination of this major scourge in the decades to come
391289 yes the judges received mercedes benz e280 this was long overdue and some of the judges had never been issued with mercedes benz vehicles ever since their appointment to the bench utility vehicles including toyota and isuzu trucks were also handed out
391290 what surprised us in this survey was how it goes across all the generations it didnt matter if you were 18 or 65 the emotional importance of lyrics was completely consistent

391295 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk this is something the military understands but the british public does not
391296 this is a highly significant mission if we do not win against the protagonists of the september 11 attacks then those who are against us will take great succour from it
391297 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
391298 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
391299 there are very small numbers of british citizens traveling out there being trained up and then returning to the uk

391303 it is the prosecution case that although these defendants may not have been the masterminds of the plan that lay behind the london bombings they shared the same beliefs and motivation as the london bombers and so willingly and knowingly agreed to assist them in their preparations by carrying out a hostile reconnaissance
391304 this man is no bomber he was a friend of the bombers but someone who was in complete ignorance as to their intentions he was a man in the wrong place at the wrong time and now caught up in a nightmare

391312 as a motion picture and television producer ive learned how incredibly powerful these mediums can be in generating public discourse sometimes almost overnight our goal with this initiative and tv show is to tip the conversation in this country about cancer to get people riled up so they want to do something about the fact that it still takes so many lives
391313 the stand up to cancer model is distinctive because it emphasises collaboration among scientists and will accelerate translational research on the verge of breakthroughs as well as provide an additional revenue stream to encourage novel high risk proposals that have great potential in making inroads against cancer
391314 the number of people coming here for free meals has more than doubled in recent months so tremendous has been the price hike
391315 another important factor is pakistans import dependency on basic food items as 80 percent of cooking oil and 20 to 30 percent of lentils are imported

391322 we are organizing this to show our solidarity and support with our tibetans inside tibet who are facing lot of problems under the chinese government rule
391323 this the only thing that we can do because our tibet is a spiritual land so we cannot do such kinds of terrorist things this is the only thing we can do like hunger strikes peaceful march candlelight and sending news to any kind newspaper we cannot do anything more than prayers and requesting all international communities
391324 were very excited to have people come and take a look at nasas history

391332 there is no question of any purge in the isi the government has already stated that there are no links or evidence of isi involvement in the kabul bombing
391333 it was in the past during jihad by afghan fighters against the red army in the 1980s that a few pro taliban elements had found their way in and with the change in policy have been firmly rooted out
391334 it is meant to defame isi this is a national institution which is vital for security the isis role in fighting terrorism and extremism is exceptional

391338 theres no doubt that we do this having reflected long and hard and recognizing the deep concerns and frustrations that canada has gone through over the nuclear history with india but you cant keep somebody in the penalty box forever
391339 the way were looking at it is that our relationship has been underperforming if not in the doldrums completely for a couple of decades now if not more and indias come a long way in terms of democracy and the rule of law and the whole nuclear constellation of issues has evolved to the point where we just cant continue with our position that has been absolute and negative to allowing india back into the nuclear club as it were

391361 if any evidence were to be presented against any individual in pakistan or against the interest of pakistans neighbours then the government would certainly act on that evidence
391362 several outstanding problems in the relationship between the united states and pakistan that the elected government inherited from the past are currently being resolved these include issues of trust between our two intelligence services
391363 if you ask me to describe the state of the india pakistan dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years

391365 in general this administration at its upper reaches has been cool to the elected government from the start they like to look at musharraf as a factor for stability

391458 im on 14th and ashland and i just witnessed a shooting
391459 no just a pop pop pop pop and a shit ton of people running
391460 its a bittersweet moment i so want some kind of resolution for my aunt
391461 had found another man and he did not want to have any kids around
391462 alice hummel disappeared never to be heard from again after agreeing to confront her husband bruce hummel about his molestation of their 13 year old daughter
391463 the evidence clearly shows that bruce hummel had the motive and opportunity to murder alice hummel and in fact did so in october 1990
391464 i rowed and bailed for an hour and a half at least but the wind got worse and i had to let her body go
391465 i was too tired to cry but i remember saying a silent prayer
391466 it was sort of an unspoken thing our family didnt talk about it at all
391467 but the circumstances of what we heard that she left without saying goodbye to her own children we knew she would never have done that a mother would never go off without saying goodbye to her own children
391468 within dubstep few people bar distance and coki have had such consistent dancefloor destruction capabilities
391469 i was shocked when he told me that my boy was paraded in his underpants around the school campus what kind of teacher would do that to a six year old
391470 of course none of the students shamed by their experience had spoken about this to their parents
391471 the kids are so petrified these days that they refuse to go to school my kid did not tell me what happened to him on the day he was paraded nude it was only when shefali approached us that my son narrated his experience
391472 we know that what the teacher has done is not correct we will look into the matter and take suitable action against her
391473 yes i did parade them around nude and also took some of them to dark room and threatened them i cant beat them up as the law prohibits me from doing so but when they do not study their parents come and confront me i had no choice but to teach them a lesson so that they concentrate on their studies
391474 the matter came to us and we called both the parties both of them have valid documents for the property i advised them to aproach the civil court both parties have agreed to settle the matter amicably
391475 advised hasina aapa to not take law in her hands
391476 shaikh has some gall no fake names have been used in the documents submitted to the finance company for eight flats in newton villa it turns out the people in whose names the documents were submitted also knew about the entire thing and were paid anywhere between rs 2 to 5 lakh for their cooperation however we have not been able to trace all of them
391477 we have nothing to do with any reclamation maybe the bmc or collector must be doing it i must say that priyadarshini park has not given any permission to trucks with debris to enter the park
391478 their mhrfs case came up for hearing before the authority last month but for want of time it could not be considered
391479 reclamation by using construction debris is not allowed in any case if it is so i will send my surveyor tomorrow to check out the situation and initiate action
391480 apart from the cost of transporting the material to the dump one has to pay rs 500 per truckload at the dumping ground for off loading the debris but here its all free
391481 i am certain that this programme will change the face of the tribal belt in shahpur locals here cultivate paddy on a very small scale at a time when there are vast expanses of land yet to be cultivated tribal youth while away their time hunting fishing and roaming around in the forests aimlessly
391482 as of now we have admitted students from lobhipada and pondyachapada the students attend school between 11 am and 4 pm once they are through with school they are taught modern methods of cultivation
391483 not more than three children from each tribal village would be admitted to the school
391484 these children will go back to their villages after finishing school and educate others we cant accommodate all the children from every village considering the fact that there are 200 odd villages in the taluka
391485 these are women from pondyachapada and lobhipada it is important that locals take the initiative in the programme which is going to benefit them in the long run the trust will support them in every which way but they must understand the significance of the programme
391486 i dont want my children to grow up and frantically search jobs in small scale units in and around shahpur this way they are learning to read and write and also getting to learn a lot about agriculture
391487 there was a time when i did not have enough money to buy two kilo rice to feed my family but today my society donates over seven tonnes of vegetables and five tonnes of tapioca every year to the underprivileged we are where we are because of father baba
391488 when i first came here through narayan bua the local priest i saw that people barely had enough to eat gradually i started making friends with people and taught them modern methods of cultivation
391489 i made bua the caretaker of the land and directed him to cultivate modern crops like tapioca which are economically viable and give better yield
391490 but over a period of time i convinced others that agricultural yield can be better provided other crops are planted two other farmers agreed to try it out
391491 when we lease out a piece of land from a farmer we pay him rent on the basis of number of trees that can be planted on it in addition to that we pay him a certain sum as the owner is also the caretaker of the farm moreover if he does come to work in the fields he gets paid rs 60 daily
391492 till a few years ago we used travel several miles everyday in search of work often we came back empty handed but now we provide employment to all the men in the village we also employ several others from neighbouring villages
391493 i am totally convinced with what fr george is doing for the villagers i believe that if the lowest segment of our society comes up the whole nation would benefit
391494 father and i discuss the action plan at the end of the day at his residence in asangaon the next day i implement it
391495 he helps the villagers in every which way over the years he has patiently worked with them he knows that his job is very tedious and has to be done very patiently had he been the owner he could have forced the people to work but he is working for their cause and he is well aware of this
391496 the food here is pathetic one can barely call it food i think inmates in jails get better food than this
391497 uncooked vegetables burnt rotis watery dal and raw rice are served to us daily though the food is unlimited we dont take a second helping in fact most of us eat out when we have the money
391498 we are supposed to get 200 ml of milk when we wake up since we hail from villages we know what milk is all about but here we get 10 per cent milk mixed with 90 per cent water
391499 in all the years that i have been staying here we have got idli sambhar only once we get stale roti and vegetable daily as breakfast
391500 only if we are very lucky do we get fresh food
391501 i dont know what non veg looks like here we have never gotten any in the hostel
391502 we are now left with no option but to go on a hunger strike to set things right after all we come from poor families and cannot afford to eat out often
391503 earlier we used to serve food cooked by our own staff but now a contractor serves them unfortunately the contractor gets a mere rs 1 000 per month per student the amount is so low that the contractor is unable to provide nutritional food i have taken up the issue with the ministry and briefed them about the problem
391504 the diet is simply unbalanced the vegetables are too less and too much of cereals has a negative impact on the growth of a child
391505 in the existing case chances of diseases like cancer diabetes and constipation are very high
391506 there is no fruit in the diet lack of adequate nutrients can lead to major depression and mood swings among children
391507 i dont know what non veg looks like here we have never gotten any in the hostel
391508 the food here is pathetic one can barely call it food i think inmates in jails get better food than this
391509 earlier we served food cooked by our staff but now a contractor serves them
391510 when there is no disease why should kids be given medicines
391511 the fact is that as of now the kids do not have any problem as such nobody has ever been affected by polio so why take the dose
391512 most people here believe that their kids would get impotent if they are vaccinated also some believe that when none of the kids who have not been vaccinated have contracted polio then why bother while we do not believe in this rubbish we firmly believe that the administration must look at issues like water sanitation health services before expecting us to convince families to vaccinate their kids
391513 the kids who have not been immunised are not only prone to get the disease but are also a threat to the entire area if at all a case of polio crops up in the area all the kids in the village and neighbouring areas run the risk of getting infected
391514 we will try our best to make them understand the importance of vaccination but theres a limit to which we can push
391515 he works with a cruise liner and felt he would have a case against him after the accident which could have an impact on his job as well why else was he was hiding for almost two days why did he not report the incident to the police
391516 in july 2003 when i moved in the green cover behind the building was one of the driving factors behind buying a house here
391517 in the beginning i didnt know who the plot belonged to so i wrote to mseb cidco nmmc and even the police when i was quite certain it belonged to cidco i called up the then cidco chairman who promised to take necessary action
391518 i am surprised how such an activity could go unnoticed i will visit the spot and take necessary action
391519 we are a registered trust our aim is to provide cheap housing to the needy
391520 first you have to become a member of our credit society by paying rs 510 we will give you a receipt for it after
391521 every building constructed by the mmrda has 140 tenements once we have 140 members we will forward the file to mmrda within 10 days the proposal will be sanctioned and they will allot us an entire building you will be allotted a house
391522 then you will have to pay rs 500 per month for the next 21 years to mmrda
391523 the person should be from the lower strata of society but if a rich guy wants he can also buy all we need is address proof and six photographs
391524 houses constructed by mmrda cannot be sold they are constructed purely for paps if an agency claims that it will get you a house for rs 1 46 lakhs they are nothing but crooks i will advise buyers to report such cases to police and also file formal complaints with my office
391525 till 1976 we were not even allowed to fill water from any of the wells in the village we had to travel at least seven km everyday to fill water from the river
391526 we wrote to the authorities stating that we would start filling water from a particular well that was being used by the upper caste kunbhi marathas
391527 but sadly though the upper caste people do not use the wells anymore as soon as we started using the wells they stopped using them
391528 we have no issues using the five wells just that they are a little away from our houses there is no caste disparity in our village anymore
391529 how can we drink water from the same well as theirs at the end of the day they are lower caste people ever since they started using our wells with the help of government machinery we stopped using them
391530 only and only if it is essential for us to visit them that we go to their houses we do not invite them for our weddings and for funerals we try and keep them away from the rest of the crowd
391531 warrior not only in the etzel but in general after having fought to establish the state mother continued to fight for us doing battle against anyone who hurt us but also took care that we would not become arrogant
391532 in the end mother also accepted the idea of dividing the land after hearing about the steps i was promoting
391533 shes tough first on herself but on other people as well
391534 her friends are long standing and separate from her political life
391535 i prefer jeans to a suit sneakers to high heels markets to malls in paris i prefer the quartier latin to the champs elys es in general i dont like formality at all it is just part of what i do you know when i was young i went to the sinai and worked as a waitress
391536 sometimes there are guy issues not only in the war in all kinds of discussions
391537 i am good at persuading people in convincing the other i try to start from their point of view so its easier for me to find a common denominator
391538 ill take her as my lawyer or friend but to lead here you have to have something hard to describe something from the innermost person that gives you hope an answer to your pain she needs to speak from her guts
391539 es todo mentira las detenciones no tienen nada que ver con sus presos que por cierto ya est n siendo liberados tiene que ver con que ham s no quiere entablar un di logo nacional porque lo nico que pretenden es crear un estado isl mico en gaza
391540 durante dos d as me interrogaron mientras me mol an a palos
391541 pourquoi ne pas concilier les deux pourquoi lartistique pas un maximum de gens
391542 i have said in the past and ill repeat again that the best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
391543 lets not be naive sen obama is running for president of the united states and so he is in a constant battle to save his political life
391544 in light of the demographics of this country i dont think its realistic to expect him to do anything other than what hes done
391545 what steps should we take as a nation to alleviate the effects of racial exclusion and racial discrimination
391546 i fear that reparations would be an excuse for some to say weve paid our debt and to avoid the much harder work
391547 if we have a program for example of universal health care that will disproportionately affect people of color because theyre disproportionately uninsured
391548 if weve got an agenda that says every child in america should get should be able to go to college regardless of income that will disproportionately affect people of color because its oftentimes our children who cant afford to go to college
391549 people say he cant run and get elected if he says those kinds of things
391550 im like well does that mean were really not ready for a black president
391551 no country in the saarc region has been spared of this plague
391552 we must ensure strengthening regional legal mechanisms and intensifying intelligence sharing
391553 all our regional partners and our many friends in other quarters that have cooperated with us in this matter
391554 the executive board today decided that he pettigrew would be disqualified from the events in which he competed in sydney
391555 in addition to these decisions it was decided that the entire u s team would be disqualified from the sydney games therefore the first place gold medal in the 4x400 meters relay is now being disqualified and the medals will be brought back to the ioc through the united states olympic committee
391556 reallocation will be discussed in due course by the executive board
391557 india will be developing even further from now on and we must build good relations with it
391558 animamos a los periodistas a que informen y denuncien los desmanes medioambientales porque sin su ayuda no podremos cambiar las cosas
391559 el absurdo es evidente pero es imposible luchar contra ello porque no te pagan por hacer las cosas bien y mejorarlas sino por ser correcto y disciplinado
391560 es inevitable que gente de diferentes pa ses del mundo no vean ciertos temas de la misma forma politizar los juegos no aporta nada bueno a esos temas y contradice el esp ritu ol mpico

391568 due to changes in the conduct of detainee operations and programs to prepare detainees for reintegration into society we have not only gone over 10 000 releases but our re internment rate is less than 1 percent
391569 for all citizens and of course the head of the government this individual generates a perfectly understandable feeling of contempt but we must respect the law
391570 demostrar al gobierno nuestra determinaci n de que vamos a continuar exigiendo nuestros derechos
391571 el r gimen del fara n practica el racismo con los beduinos tenemos nuestras propias leyes nuestros propios jueces que respetamos y son justos pero el gobierno egipcio es opresor e injusto

391574 nb please do not read the lyrics whilst listening to the recordings
391575 in order to possess a song people do want to know what the lyrics are
391576 its emotional theres a reasoning you want to know why this line affects you so much
391577 might as well face it youre a dick in a glove
391578 when i was young and listening to elvis costello you had your own idea of what the lyrics were
391579 later when you then see the lyrics on the pages of boxed set sleevenotes you think thats not as good as i thought
391580 because then theyve made it their own theyve created the meaning and its all about meaning and identity
391581 a philosophy for life everyone in their lifetime is at one point the walrus the eggman and even the goo goo goo joob so i suppose the walrus is the leader the eggman is the follower and the goo goo goo joob is just undecided this song holds all the answers
391582 i sat on the roof and kicked off the moss well a few of the verses well theyve got me quite cross
391583 you see ive forgotten if theyre green or theyre blue anyway the thing is what i really mean yours are the sweetest eyes ive ever seen
391584 its interesting that people feel the need to have the text metered out on the page in front of them more often the more resonant meaning is in the sound the way its sung rather than on the page
391585 if you just look at the words written down youre missing a substantial part of the meaning and meaning is unfixed the way everybody hears a particular song is different and you bring your own resonance to the words
391586 it is often the songs that have less meaning that people tend to attach their meaning to like one what is it actually about
391587 both songs are very big echoey edifices of sound but very specifically human or humane in the point theyre making
391588 im not a u2 fan but one is a beautiful and affecting song in the line carry each other there is a sense of unity a very humane sentiment everybody hurts is the same its there in the title
391589 an added extra like a patio or a conservatory they are not important but add to your quality of life

391616 in august 1998 deep in the bowels of the british museum work began on building an extension to the erotic literature and artefacts section whilst the curator was cleaning some shelves he found a locked portmanteau wedged between a collection of early byzantine pornographic texas homecare bathroom tiles and a first edition of janet and john go brass rubbing the portmanteau turned out to have once belonged to a doctor john h watson and hidden under his surgical instruments were several volumes of hitherto unpublished memoirs recording his adventures with none other than sherlock holmes
391617 my sincerest heartfelt apologies go out to every person i have offended in my regrettable use of very inappropriate language i am deeply disappointed in myself for speaking out in anger to my son and using such a hateful term in a private phone conversation it was completely taken out of context i was disappointed in his choice of a friend not due to her race but her character however i have the utmost respect and aloha for black people who have already suffered so much due to racial discrimination and acts of hatred

391623 we found that american indians and alaska natives african americans and hispanics are more likely to be victims of fraud than non hispanic whites
391624 these findings will help us fine tune our hispanic law enforcement and outreach initiative and explore additional opportunities to target frauds aimed at communities which are at risk
391625 the results of our survey indicate that fraud in the u s is a serious problem
391626 we have brought many enforcement actions against these types of scams in the past and we will bring more in the future

391639 there are some things going on that i cant talk about
391640 i dont think im free to say whether i have gotten a letter or not
391641 a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who in the judgment of the prosecutor is a putative defendant
391642 all truly wise thoughts have been thought already thousands of times but to make them truly ours we must think them over again honestly till they take root in our personal experience

391658 the metropolitan police will be sending a team of officers to antigua today
391659 the team which will include one officer from south wales police will support the local senior investigating officers
391660 the family courts effectively make fathers a slave to the state his wages become state property his time with his children is determined by a family court judge and he faces jail if for whatever reason he fails to pay his child support on time
391661 by elevating single motherhood from an unfortunate consequence of poor planning to a sophisticated act of self fulfilment weve helped to fashion a world in which fathers are not just scarce but in which men are superfluous
391662 at the same time that men have been ridiculed in the public sphere the importance of fatherhood has been diminished along with other traditionally male roles of father protector and provider which are incredibly viewed as regressive manifestations of an outmoded patriarchy
391663 when we take away a mans central purpose in life and marginalise him from societys most important institution the family we strip him of his manhood
391664 growing up without a father is the most reliable indicator of poverty and all the familiar social pathologies affecting children including drug abuse truancy delinquency and sexual promiscuity yet some feminists and other progressives still insist that men are non essential
391665 in the coming years we will need men who are not confused about their responsibilities to family and country we need boys who have acquired the virtues of honour courage valour and loyalty we need women willing to let men be men and boys be boys
391666 when men visit their purpose is obvious so the number of bars has increased significantly
391667 regardless of age more than 70 percent of male tourists on group tours buy sex
391668 korean men here have the worst behavior for instance a 70 something korean man had a mongolian woman as a mistress when she got pregnant he abandoned her and ran away
391669 sex tourism is undermining the image of south korea and its people
391670 when men who are here as sex tourists arrive at the airport they are escorted here local women arrive here in a different van when they move off to the grassland the women are accompanied by the men
391671 anti korean sentiment is high because korean men buy sex from local women
391672 there have been cases in which four 60 something men spent time with one 20 something woman in a room until morning and others in which tourists go directly to an underground karaoke bar at their hotel as soon as they arrive from the airport without even unpacking their baggage if these things continue to happen it will be difficult to stop the violence
391673 prostitution in south korea isnt even being punished properly so the government cant punish people for soliciting prostitution in foreign countries
391674 the mindset and culture of korean males which view females as objects of entertainment needs to be fundamentally changed

391677 wolfgang clement hat durch sein politisches lebenswerk erhebliche und beachtenswerte leistungen und beitr ge erbracht und sich damit um die spd verdient gemacht

391685 our current use it or lose it system for fers employees hurts productivity and increases training costs we need to be incentivizing the accrual of sick leave not encouraging people to call in sick in the weeks leading up to retirement
391686 the passage of this bill represents a significant victory for workers enrolled under the fers system
391687 not only does it provide a well deserved reward for the most dedicated of our public servants but it does so in a way that ensures their legacy of honest hard work is passed on to future generations
391688 far too many new federal workers were leaving free money on the table by waiting to enroll in the tsp
391689 with this bill new enrollment will occur automatically that will be a good thing for young people entering the federal workforce
391690 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our online gaming for the greater society industry can benefit from this special night
391691 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual online gaming for the greater society award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a online gaming for the greater society project
391692 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he online gaming for the greater society industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
391693 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a online gaming for the greater society industry demonstrate to the general public
391694 i think everyone had a great time we definitely showed the local crowd and the media about the positive forces at work in our industry and this can only help us as we move forward into more aggressive larger projects
391695 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
391696 kolopajlo stillions who took home the superior achievement in online gaming for the greater society design implementation was quick to thank the many researchers and workers that supported the efforts that produced this award

391703 no more fitting and expressive memorial of the heroic valor and signal triumphs of our army than the battlefield itself with its natural and artificial defen s es preserved and perpetuated in the exact form and condition they presented during the battle
391704 but in a larger sense we can not dedicate we can not consecrate we can not hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract

391725 the use of erotic images attention grabbing stories etc for enticing users to run files or follow links is known as social engineering even though it is a technique that has been in use for a long time many users still fall in the trap and therefore cyber crooks continue to employ it simply updating the subject matter to make it more attractive and up to date
391726 cyber crooks use false news erotic photos and other topics to trick users into clicking links and running files in order to infect them this is known as social engineering
391727 we have recently seen other examples of social engineering used to spread malicious code a false news report about a fake ups email
391728 this type of trojan is coherent with the current malware dynamic where cyber crooks are no longer after fame or notoriety but simply seek to benefit financially from their activity

391733 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk

391782 i believe that things happen for a reason in this case my teammates were able to prove themselves because they finished 11th and did qualify as a team without me for myself i was able to prove that i could come back from a very traumatic injury it does build strength of character
391783 i feel healed but i can also still feel that stuff in there
391784 here i was 26 years old and completely dependent on other people i couldnt shower i couldnt prepare my own meals that really opened my eyes it was a lesson in asking others for help which id never really done in my life

391790 given the current state of the economy we are encouraged by the high number of workers feeling secure in their jobs and the rise in the percentage of workers who are confident in the future of their employers

391800 when we examine the message of the quran and the sunnah of prophet muhammad peace and blessings be upon him we find that violence is completely rejected and repugnant this is not only in dealing with women but violence is not accepted either in dealing with animals and other creatures violence does not help in building sound human relations therefore it is not a way that islam promotes the prophet peace and blessings be upon him has set the best example in dealing with his wives and daughters never was he reported as being abusive to either his daughters or his wives the prophet on the other hand was merciful and compassionate the prophet discouraged domestic violence in many hadiths he banned it from the first time he arrived in madinah even the hadith that is mostly quoted and interpreted by some people as permitting a husband to physically abuse his wife is to be interpreted and understood in the context of other hadiths when the prophet peace and blessings be upon him came to madinah he dealt with arabs that used to abuse their wives all the time that is why the prophet wanted to gradually ban this evil custom so when umar ibn al khattab came to the prophet explaining that people were doing this as a custom and they grew up doing that the prophet took this into consideration and this was a transition period before the final and complete prohibition the shari ah allows women the right to complain to the muslim judge or court and report any cases of physical abuse the judge has the right to discretionary punish those husbands who are proven to be abusive to their wives

391819 with a view to improving relations between the football communities on the island of cyprus
391820 this is an interim measure prior to a solution to the cyprus problem
391821 to play in formal competitions you have to be a member of fifa the only way would be to join the greek cypriot league but we are not willing to do this therefore we would only be able to play friendly matches under this proposal
391822 the administration recognizes that mass killings ethnic cleansing and forced deportations of over one and a half million armenians were conducted by the ottoman empire we indeed hold ottoman officials responsible for those crimes
391823 to help archivists protect the evidence of the past so that future generations will have the documentation of the mass killings and deportations of armenians committed by ottoman soldiers and other ottoman officials in 1915
391824 our goal is not to open a debate on whether the ottomans committed these horrendous acts it is to help preserve the documentation that supports the truth of those events
391825 particularly the point that the americans see world war i era events as fully documented realities is disturbing and makes washingtons stated support for our proposal for the creation of a joint armenian turkish history commission to probe the events totally irrelevant
391826 if the events are fully known there is no need for an investigation the letter says which is in contradiction with the official u s policy
391827 the state department letter although clearly falling short of americas moral responsibility and national interest in recognizing and condemning the armenian genocide did mark a step in the direction of distancing u s policy from the dictates of the turkish government
391828 we wish the president success because his successes will be to the benefit of our people and homeland
391829 i know what the people want but sometimes the people are asleep when the leadership is not vigilant there is a risk of indifference and everyone has to be on national alert
391830 because the entire political leadership accepted a federation and so that the people of cyprus would not be divided it is with great pain that the church and archbishop accepted a federation
391831 the president stated unequivocally that he will stick with his principles until the end he will claim the rights of our people and wants a solution so that people could easily survive in the land of their forefathers we agreed on this and i am very satisfied
391832 not made uncomfortable by the muezzin on the northern side but by the turkish soldiers
391833 if you vote yes for the annan plan you will not go to heaven
391834 the aim of the program is to improve relations between turkey and africa to provide african countries with modern agriculture and animal breeding technologies and to raise incomes and living standards
391835 men in executive positions at newspapers simply must talk through this

391837 perhaps prefer to see a photo of a beautiful woman rather than a man and take after her i dont think that people want to see mens photographs every day
391838 if restrictions are introduced dailies will lose a quality feature
391839 we dont have to keep pushing a media habit just because it is done abroad turkey is a country that emphasizes traditions and customs as women are considered sacred
391840 but i realized after losing the case that tv footage and photographs have an influence over the judicial system as well
391841 they arent prejudiced if we explain our problem they are surprised at first and then they agree with us
391842 it is important to set up a vehicle from criticism to change
391843 we read so many articles about famous women who get drunk in bars if they want to be placed correctly in the media they should behave
391844 we like to look at womens photos but this doesnt mean were perverts
391845 dont you women look at a half naked man when you see one
391846 most of the documents sent to the general staff within the investigation were proved to be forged by imitating tsks correspondence procedure or using computer techniques
391847 we decided in the meeting that it would be beneficial to rearrange well equipped hospitals in particular regions as hospitals in order to provide imprisoned and convicted people who need to be treated in hospitals with the proper health care it will also be appropriate for those to be transferred to these hospitals if needed
391848 lack of supervision and the loose financial sanctions for illegal koran courses lead to increase in the number of illegal koran centers
391849 the government overlooked the illegal koran courses and played a crucial role in corrupting secular and scientific education and creating an environment where students receive religious education in poor conditions via these changes
391850 students should have been protected but society got used to these tragedies
391851 i was in the section of the building that did not collapse with five other friends we closely felt the flames coming up from the ground floor
391852 the concrete quality of the building is so bad anything that we touch falls into pieces
391853 i went into the kitchen with two teachers and one of them said a gas pipe has broken
391854 we woke up for the pre dawn prayer some of our friends went for a wash and a great explosion occurred there
391855 while preparing the show we followed the original writings of homer
391856 the story is about people of anatolia standing together despite the differences and fighting hand in hand against the enemy this is the idea that we as turks need the most these days
391857 there was no hesitation at all because the idea was very old and well known
391858 we didnt use the turkish dance figures in their pure shape
391859 i wouldnt call the choreography modernized but consider it rather as some kind of interpretation five thousand year old culture cannot be modernized
391860 after the show they asked me if the choreographer was russian however we didnt get any negative criticism but only astonishments and compliments
391861 if one wants to stage a show in turkey one has to build the stage as there is a shortage
391862 i import almost everything including the curtains clothes and even the projectors it is also very difficult to find a dancer which is why we train people by ourselves it is not easy to find a musical artist in turkey as well we need schools for this
391863 at the same time they practice ballet folk dance modern dance and belly dance for this reason the conservatory students are not for us
391864 due to political and social tension kurds had some fights with the roma gypsies of tarlaba few years ago
391865 people try to attribute this massacre to the kurdish society
391866 kurds are regarded as potential terrorists and criminals depending on their deprived conditions many of them are obliged to earn a living from robbery and drug dealing here in tarlaba
391867 it is obvious that some paramilitary groups are responsible for this atrocity
391868 but the method and mentality of the most recent attack suggests other culprits including the so called deep state or the so called ergenekon gang
391869 as a nation seeking its own self respect and human dignity there is no logic for kurds to explode such a bomb at the time when ergenekon case is on agenda
391870 kurdish society has always been the target of the authorities for instance some kurdish children allegedly burned the turkish flag in mersin two years ago however it later was proven that this event was carried out by provocative groups
391871 the ethnic turkish community is likely to regard kurds as potential terrorists
391872 we had difficulty enrolling my children in tarlaba middle school when we first arrived here in 1999
391873 they did not want to accept my kids just because of our kurdish identity
391874 tarlaba is like a slaughter house especially for the children life in this district accelerates the level of degeneration for kurdish children as well as youth it gradually consumes them into a dirty life
391875 most of the kurds could not find a proper job in istanbuls big factories just because of their ethnicity turkish society should notice the dynamics of real life and they have to react with a sense of responsibility for what kurds have been experiencing especially in the last 20 years
391876 there is no kurd who doesnt suffer in a city like istanbul
391877 because 10 of its members already decided that the party is so
391878 our constitutional system allows the prosecutor to do so the result of any such case will depend on the courts decision
391879 it is possible to open another case with new evidence
391880 in fact the public prosecutor may have brought new evidence during the trial by submitting an additional indictment that would include incidents after the opening of the case but he did not
391881 but the debate is whether k l s words reflect his own opinion or that of the entire court
391882 all courts including the constitutional court speak through their decisions the court presidents long speech should be frowned upon constitutional court judges should be more scientific more judicial and more passive they already reflect their views in their decisions
391883 we have always asked our counterparts to modify their political behavior
391884 we were never a focal point of anti secular activities i do not accept this we expected a non closure decision and should not have received any sanction
391885 we would only be pleased with the efforts of third parties for the improvement of turkeys ties with armenia but we are already meeting with armenia directly toward the normalization of relations
391886 as we have said previously we strongly support and have confidence in turkeys democracy and institutions the united states will continue to work with the turkish government to advance our common interests in the region and in the world
391887 we look forward to a continuation of the process of democratic and economic reform in turkey and we urged a reinvigoration of turkeys eu accession efforts on the basis of these reforms
391888 now we call on all political actors to work together and resolve their differences in a spirit of dialogue and compromise
391889 we will continue as we did till now to work closely with the turkish government and with all political actors in turkey we also hope if the technical conditions are met to open new chapters during our presidency
391890 clear message to all political actors who are called upon to work towards reconciliation and a national consensus about how to strengthen secular democracy and the rule of law in this country
391891 eventually and this seems to me a very important point the decision of the court opens the way to a civilized and fair coexistence between conservatives and seculars which up to now has not yet reached a proper balance in this country but im convinced that this necessary coexistence will soon be possible and granted to all in turkey
391892 our expectation from the government is now to continue the eu reform program i think we have to be realistic about what can be achieved before the next progress report in november
391893 we mustnt expect radical changes before november but now is definitely the time for the government to make the year 2008 a year of the eu
391894 but thats okay the expat harem is a place of female power
391895 friendship isnt about whom you have known for the longest time and spent most of your life with its about who came to stay and never left your side
391896 there is no limit or point where you can stop because you are good enough eventually you will find yourself helpless and have to challenge yourself when you are stuck in the middle of an ocean storm no matter how professional you are so this feeling of not having full control over it turns it into a passion
391897 turkish people are ambitious they do not give up at the beginners stage but usually want to continue to a more advanced level the quality and professionalism of instructors has also improved
391898 when you figure out the balance issue and understand how to use the wind you can pick up the basic skills of sailing steering and turning after one week of practice
391899 but they could have made this road behind the coast
391900 once there was a lovely village on the long beach with its black sand and olive trees we had a place to rest but now there is no sand and no trees anymore if someone had said that this could happen to this place i wouldnt believe but now it has happened
391901 at once a permit was given for building the road
391902 i wanted this documentary to be an example for the residents in the eastern region of the black sea coast we have to inform them what will happen to their villages and environment
391903 this road is the biggest project in the history of the republic of turkey towards modernism and progress step by step we will achieve our aim there are millions of people who cant reach the unique beauty of this coast this road will show the people in what a rich and beautiful country they live in
391904 the mayor of abana supported the documentary but the administrative district didnt give us the permission
391905 many teachers were interested in our movie so we gave them a dvd of the documentary to be shown in the classrooms
391906 when the people see what happened to our shore in vakf kebir they get more afraid that the same thing will happen to their shore if they dont oppose
391907 if this is the sea i know for years im sure the sea will take this road back
391908 divan is one of the most magic brands turkey possesses when you mention divan every turkish citizen will express admiration our objective is to preserve this wonderful heritage and therefore we are branding divan in the area of deluxe hotels and up market pastry shops fine service and no concession on quality with a touch of turkey are what divan stands for we are developing new hotels in the istanbul area in pendik and orlu but divan elmada will also be turned into a landmark hotel
391909 divan elmada was a pioneer in the turkish five star hotel industry and we want it to be also for the generations to come furthermore we are looking to other secondary cities in turkey such as gaziantep bursa and eski ehir we will have a second boutique hotel in ankara in 2009 where the recently opened divan ankara which is operating with tremendous success has proven in a very short time that there absolutely is a place for divan hotels internationally we are looking to eastern and central europe and hopefully we will be able to make some exciting announcements
391910 as divan we are mainly focusing on city business hotels and with consistent economic growth we believe that there are opportunities for us throughout the country as to the typical tourism industry in the coastal areas and the south of turkey the enormous boom in hotel accommodation has certainly led to an oversupply in the short term however with the development of domestic tourism and improved infrastructure and connectivity over time there is reason to see stabilization here also the industry will remain one of the most important contributors to the turkish economy
391911 the hospitality industry offers great opportunities for creating zones of responsibilities whereby an employee can take job ownership once a sound system is in place the industry offers great opportunities for the growth and development of each individual once you have an environment with happy and motivated employees guests are happy and will come back
391912 it is long overdue and extremely satisfying to see that more and more turkish managers including some of my former employees are managing key properties and hopefully many more are to come
391913 essential in order to be productive and find new creative ideas but of course traveling through turkey is again one of my regular hobbies as despite my 13 years in the country there are still many areas i havent visited
391914 we grow and produce our own wine in verac which is in the bordeaux area the winery is a boutique winery where we produce only red wine we are very proud of it and it will be our retirement activity it is indeed a family business and my wife mireille is looking after it however we are glad that our daughter audrey is also very much interested and participates as much as she can after a long process our wine is now also available in turkey
391915 but creative talent is not only a gift it needs to be developed and nurtured over the years as a family we have lived in many cities throughout europe and that gave her an opportunity to become multicultural and this likely helped her to maximize her talent audrey is currently in france where she is producing art and at the same time preparing her future for various projects she hopes to be selected for
391916 i think so the grass is always greener elsewhere however i can look back to a great time and the hotel industry did give me great satisfaction
391917 it illustrates the degree to which doping simply will not be tolerated
391918 it doesnt belong to me so i will be returning it to the ioc because i dont want it
391919 it was not won fairly i am deeply disappointed and saddened
391920 when someone wants to learn english to move forward in a career but english classes are not enough they come to me
391921 this is for people who can read the paper and full length books so with them it is not an issue of learning english
391922 but theres some sort of obstacle standing in the way they dont always know what it is but they want to move their careers forward
391923 we found out his writing was hard to read and cloaked his attempt to express his ideas
391924 with him it was a matter of taking the writing and bringing it closer to the speaking
391925 when i talk to my in laws my turkish dries on the vine
391926 if im a native speaker and experience the blocks then how do my students feel
391927 moving to any new country is hard but you are the same person with the same strengths and weaknesses
391928 its just like the center of gravity has changed and you need to learn to use your muscles again
391929 the strengths you had before will help you here too but you dont know how
391930 keep an open mind experiment and you will find something
391931 i love a few specific views of the city this is a pretty good one
391932 some of the most amazing views in istanbul are in bad neighborhoods
391933 it allows me to stay in touch with a lot of people
391934 istanbul is a huge city and its so busy you meet people you will never meet again and thats a waste thats how this tool has been useful to me
391935 an idiom may be useless to an expat but to a turk they are useful
391936 please stay indoors as it is no longer advisable to come out or move about until we are through
391937 our cameraman brought out his camera and started to shoot the security operatives who now sited us asked us not to shoot and our cameraman to stop shooting
391938 we obliged them but before we could know what was happening one of their vehicles came from the rear and three of their men advanced menacingly towards us with their riffles ready to shoot at us they ordered us to halt and that if we run they will shoot us
391939 we stopped our cameraman even dropped his camera on the ground while all of us raised our hands in submission they came to us and started beating our cameraman afterwards they bundled him into their vehicle and drove away the wailing staff lamented
391940 around mid day today thursday july 31st 2008 a combined team of operatives of the state security services sss and fierce looking mobile policemen raided the home of leader of the niger delta peoples salvation front mujaheed dokubo asari
391941 when they arrived at his residence at no 9 azdope crescent off kumasi
391942 no search warrant was displayed and no court order was also shown to have been obtained
391943 the 100 million euros offered by real is astonishing but not everything can be bought
391944 i think its right that a player is not authorised to have the last word always
391945 ferguson is stubborn i think ronaldo will stay at manchester its the right decision from a technical point of view
391946 however portugals result at the european championships shows that not even ronaldo can win a big tournament on his own
391947 its beautiful to see him run after his defender until the corner flag hes the prototype of the modern champion
391948 i genuinely believe in my heart of hearts with the way that i felt at the end of last season that i will come back this season
391949 ive trained through the summer and i genuinely feel ill be fine but until youve gone out there and done it it means nothing
391950 ive got to go and do the very best i can to stay at because thats the only place where i really want to play football
391951 weve taken this decision to retire because our competitive and private lives became impossible after the media scandal erupted
391952 we are very confused as nobody officially told us anything clear about the doping suspicions
391953 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
391954 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
391955 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
391956 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
391957 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
391958 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
391959 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
391960 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
391961 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
391962 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
391963 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
391964 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
391965 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
391966 if youre out of shape and most of us are and you want to change you have to do some exercise the way we reprogram muscle in adults is by training
391967 after four weeks of receiving the drug the mice were behaving as if theyd been exercised
391968 non si poteva svendere la citt n fare atti illeggittimi stato fatto il possibile
391969 most of these problems have to do more with poverty as it always believed that a hungry man is an angry man most of the perpetrators are people suffering from economic problems while in other cases politicians tend to exploit the impoverished situation of these categories of nigerians to achieve their selfish interest knowing that religion is very sentimental issue which touches on the emotions of the people and could easily fight back if this sentiment is tampered with

391974 we the 100 national and international ngo members of acbar express our grave concern about the deteriorating security situation in afghanistan and the serious impact on civilians
391975 but we need the continued support of ngos and the international community if we are to prevent further suffering
391976 it is imperative that they remain committed to afghanistan the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the un alone
391977 especially the increasing use of suicide bombings and other indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas and the use of civilian property from which to launch attacks
391978 are mounting an increasingly vigorous systematic terror campaign of threats abductions and executions aimed against members of the civilian population
391979 searches conducted by afghan and international forces have on some occasions involved excessive use of force extra judicial killings destruction of property and or mistreatment of suspects
391980 our profitability is somewhat below the level of last year but we will meet our year end target and may even exceed it
391981 we expect to achieve a better performance in the second half of the year
391982 we request the same advantages which are provided for farmers through fuel oil support and for ship administrators through private consumption tax and value added tax allowances
391983 there are smes with extended maturities and who could experience problems hence we are trying to monitor them more closely
391984 it is certainly not painless for either side it is all in all only acceptable in view of the duration of the settlement and the performance related one off payment
391985 it is imperative however that the increased costs be compensated for by higher productivity resolution of the pay dispute on their own initiative by lufthansa and ver di is an important message to our customers as well as our staff and to germany as an economic base we will go to every length to resume flight operations quickly for our customers in the customary reliability and quality
391986 price declines are occurring in areas where subprime lending was heavily concentrated and a large percentage of sales are foreclosure sales
391987 those sales are always significantly lower than transactions that are not forced
391988 its important that we focus on stabilizing the financial system
391989 a very substantial change in the balance between growth and inflation
391990 you have to do the backstop because once you get to that point your particular choices are very limited
391991 that is a fiscal policy operation essentially something which should be set up in the treasury department
391992 we will put some of the properties of the state up for sale and we will also rent some of them in order to recover from the crisis
391993 we anticipate that new york will incur a budget deficit of 26 2 billion in the upcoming three years
391994 we cannot just stand still and wait until the problem is solved in other words we have to find urgent solutions and put them in effect right away
391995 foreign banks unfortunately have crept into their own skin nowadays we are left on our own there are problems in finding long term financing
391996 it was again a crisis period when we won the tav and atat rk airport tender in 1998 there were problems in finding resources nowadays with lack of foreign banks there are problems in finding long term financing foreign banks are not keen on long term projects as they used to be in the past
391997 foreign banks propose high prices and complicate loan conditions the foreigners who do not have much appetite have entered a phase of behaving more cautiously
391998 whenever there is a problem in the world long term financing becomes more selective in global markets
391999 it has almost come to a halt due to negative conditions in turkey as long as there is a problem in finding long term funding turkish banks no matter how willing they are will not be able to finance their long term projects as easily as in the past
392000 lacks the qualities needed to lead britain effectively through its economic problems
392001 if liquidity was not an issue you would definitely see more people with overweight positions and much more research coverage
392002 we are positive on the long term economic outlook but its hard to be bullish on the stock market because there are few liquid ways to play the domestic consumption story
392003 we do like the whole commodity prices story for the long term but at some stage there will be certainly a decent pullback in commodity prices
392004 peru has the best trends going forward compared to other emerging markets
392005 perus stock market is under owned and under invested so it brings opportunities
392006 peru has had an excellent performance in recent years riding on the commodities boom and the appointment of a president that turned out to be the most market friendly option
392007 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
392008 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
392009 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
392010 we werent suggesting in any way hes using race as an issue
392011 is using the same old low road politics that voters are very unhappy about to distract voters from the real issues in this campaign
392012 i know that i dont look like the americans whove previously spoken in this great city
392013 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
392014 hes the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
392015 i dont believe there are many chances that a government led by kadima can be formed as the political world has entered such a zone of turbulence that it will be difficult to restore calm
392016 the need to bring to justice the perpetrators of such crimes and urging the government of sudan to comply with its obligations in this respect and reiterating its condemnation of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in darfur
392017 after the battles there is blood on the ground things will get worse
392018 this struggle calms down for a while then it opens up again
392019 we were able to salvage some of the goods people came in and smashed up the place
392020 id had absolutely no problems before there was none of this sectarianism
392021 if they try to get through the army they will die immediately
392022 we are talking about the existence of a sect if things slip out of control everything would be permitted
392023 what happened here in tripoli is definitely a reaction to what happened in beirut
392024 there is someone igniting this fighting political forces are exploiting this old state of fear
392025 its a battle between states yes there is a syrian saudi struggle
392026 i dream that there will be a settlement in lebanon for that you need a settlement abroad
392027 u want me 2 still confused me a little im so excited
392028 im currently packing up real quick to hop on a plane to new york for a second opinion but i wanted to let you all know first that there is no chance of me competing in beijing
392029 the timing is so unfortunate and this makes me more sad than anything
392030 after wednesdays match i knew there was something seriously wrong with my shoulder
392031 after taking a few different exams and mris the doctors found two small tears in the tendons of my shoulder this is something that needs a lot of time to heal it really hurts me to say i have to miss the olympics
392032 the magnitude of the deaths is undeniable the continuing occupation by us forces guarantees a mass death rate in excess of 10 000 people per month with half that number dying at the hands of us forces a carnage so severe and so concentrated as to equate it with the most heinous mass killings in world history this act has not gone unnoticed recently dennis kucinich introduced a single impeachment article against george w bush for lying to congress and the american people about the reasons for invading iraq on july 15 the house forwarded the resolution to the judiciary committee with a 238 to 180 vote we owe our children and ourselves a future without the shame of mass murder on our collective conscience the only resolution to of this dilemma is the immediate withdrawal of all us troops in iraq and the prosecution and imprisonment of those responsible anything less creates a permanent original sin on the soul of the nation for that we will forever suffer
392033 first the akp should do this and that and then we will do such and such
392034 we do not need a guide because the village is in sight
392035 i am not sure if opportunities will be the same for the next generation
392036 i had actually thought that the akp should not get any punishment at all
392037 i see every ethnicity in this country as the richness of this country turk kurd laz circassian abhaz bosnian and arab are like fingers in a hand we fought in the malazgirt war side by side we fought together the liberation war in kosovo polje mohacs sar kam yemen anakkale we are united and our people of different ethnicities are dear to us all our brothers united around the supra identity of citizens of the republic of turkey are the constitutive elements of this country people trying to separate us are those who are unaware of our thousands years of history we will not allow misuse of this
392038 the office of the prosecutor is trying to legitimize the case more than they are trying to unveil it
392039 according to the indictment ergenekon is a rooted organization but the national intelligence does not know this
392040 problems must be solved in democracy and politics before they are resorted to the court
392041 in order for turkey not to fall into the same situation again starting with the political parties everyone and every institution should take responsibility
392042 we continue for the sake of our democratic laic and social law state this is the path pointed by mustafa kemal atat rk a path that takes us to modernization a path that directs turkey to a full membership in the eu as the representative of modernization target of our republic there will be no return
392043 he only lost two points on the last set thats terrible for the tennis right now i know im in a good position because roger has to win everything from here from olympics to us open but i dont think too much right now i only think about trying to improve my game for tomorrow
392044 its disappointing losing without getting broken but its not the first player it has happened to especially to a guy like ivo
392045 theres always danger in tough matches against ivo i knew that from the start
392046 i guess ill analyze and assess my game after the us open for the moment its just all a blur so many tournaments in a row big tournaments in a row its hard its a tough trip weve got up in front of us now going back to china and coming back to the open
392047 those are really the ones that can make this season from a good one to a great one again i hope i can manage to pull off something in the next couple of weeks
392048 i will collect hazelnuts there to be able to support my family during the winter
392049 mr holbrooke undertook on behalf of the usa that i would not be tried before this tribunal
392050 that i get out of the way and go to russia greece or serbia and open a private clinic just as long as i left pale
392051 it is clear that unable to fulfill the commitments he had undertaken on behalf of the usa he holbrooke switched to plan b the liquidation of radovan karadzic
392052 the agreement which should have brought me peace and freedom thus became a source of great danger to my life and to the life and safety of my family and even my friends
392053 the first is the media witch hunt which began in the muslim media even before the beginning of the armed conflict and which proclaimed me a war criminal at a time when the only victims were serbs
392054 it is now unimaginable to many people that this court could acquit me i believe that this fact seriously jeopardizes the trial itself
392055 it is hard to think of a nation more familiar than turkey with the tensions between east and west between religion and nationalism between autocracy and democracy
392056 this seemed the best place to say goodbye since so many of you stayed here before it was a hotel
392057 the resulting improved prospects for policy continuity and political stability will likely bolster investor confidence widening the sources for the financing of turkeys large current account deficit
392058 the stable outlook on turkey balances the improvement in the republics external financing prospects and underlying fundamentals against its vulnerability to financing shocks
392059 the privatization pipeline would have stalled foreign exchange deposit build up by residents would have accelerated and appetite for equities and bonds would have likely further waned
392060 ci siamo divertiti a raccontare questo amore cos attuale e controverso tra una ragazzina e un quarantenne ma come proseguire stiamo ancora cercando idee
392061 che sar accompagnata in tutte le sue emozioni primo amore compreso intrecciandole con le vicende della madre e della nonna in un quadro plurigenerazionale tutto al femminile
392062 gli adolescenti problematici o disagiati ma la normalit delle difficolt dei sentimenti scelgo di rappresentare la realt pi comune quella che emerge dal mio blog che la mia fonte dispirazione da anni un punto dosservazione privilegiato che mi consente di conoscere meglio i giovani e riuscire ad interpretarli

392064 cannot not be amended nor shall their amendment be proposed
392065 e imparai con umilt e fatica ma imparai quello che dovevo fare
392066 ik wil de eerste michael phelps zijn en niet de tweede mark spitz
392067 daarmee wil ik zijn prestaties niet naar beneden praten want hij heeft nog steeds het beste resultaat op de spelen ooit op zijn naam staan ik wil me gewoon focussen op mijn eigen doel
392068 ik heb me nog nooit zo goed gevoeld als nu
392069 ik wil eerst kijken hoe het daar allemaal loopt in peking hoeveel tijd ik bijvoorbeeld nodig heb om in het zwembad te komen het is toch een kwestie van slim doseren en kansen grijpen
392070 het liefst zwem ik de 200 meter maar als het de 100 vrij in de weg zit is de beslissing snel genomen als ik die afstand laat schieten doe ik het wel met pijn in mijn hart
392071 dat is iets nieuws en dat is altijd moeilijk in sydney werden voor het eerst halve finales gezwommen en toen wisten mensen ook niet goed hoe er mee om te gaan
392072 dat verander je niet zomaar even ik verwacht daarom dat het in de series loeihard zal gaan en dat het daarna afvlakt er zullen altijd uitzonderingen zijn in bijvoorbeeld de finale van de 100 vrij maar ik denk dat in de avond de meeste wereldrecords gaan vallen
392073 je kunt je niet permitteren in de series iets te laten liggen
392074 dat is wel een verschil met vier en acht jaar geleden in sydney was inge de bruijn bijvoorbeeld torenhoog favoriet de toppers zitten er nu tegenaan te schurken als ze alles goed doen kunnen ze de kansen pakken die er liggen
392075 de vrouwen zijn wereldrecordhouders en marleen staat met haar tijd op de 50 vrij tweede op de ranglijst maar we willen meer dan twee medailles pieter van den hoogenband en inge dekker kunnen ook voor een succes zorgen al het hele seizoen hebben we goede prestaties neergezet ik verwacht dat we dat in peking ook weer gaan doen
392076 we hebben niks laten liggen en aan alle details gedacht we zijn er klaar voor
392077 for years the first thing that came to mind when one said tsyd cup was the football tournament played between galatasaray fenerbah e and be ikta
392078 now that it is not organized anymore we want people to know about golfs tsyd cup
392079 it was a hard decision i know im doing it for the right reasons
392080 i know how i feel about my country i love what america stands for and that were the free world but freedom has never been free people have paid for it
392081 if you play in this country live in this country and you grow up in the heartland and you put on a russian uniform you are not a patriotic person
392082 they had a long time to give me the opportunity
392083 if becky was given a fair shake to begin with than maybe she would be in a u s uniform
392084 i wish her well to each their own i mean we have people doing much worse in the world
392085 i think a lot of things are often blurred with patriotism playing in the olympics is more important than taking the heat for the decision
392086 im not immune to it but ive learned to extend people grace
392087 yes there could be some faults but halting the excavations harms the cultural heritage the judge will decide who is right in the end
392088 we had previously reported this plundering to the ministry and an investigation was launched afterwards many artifacts are really in bad shape everyone knows about the years old excavations in the area but none of the findings were preserved properly and diving still continues in the forbidden zone we cleaned up some of the mess around and explored the settlement area and the city entrance where cleopatra whose name is engraved in mosaics brought the stoa odeon and amphitheatre into the daylight becuase we have no electricity and water here it is difficult for us to continue works still these are not excuses and we cannot waste time to protect our cultural heritage
392089 they are investing in football and you should not take any team too lightly on that level
392090 we have to advance to the champions league in order to contribute to turkish footballs progress
392091 we can say that both of those teams are not that serious
392092 in the past we were more concerned about our oppositions and now they are feeling the same for us it doesnt matter if the first game is played on the away field those clubs cannot match fenerbah es quality
392093 we are extremely happy and satisfied with drawing against the bosnian team
392094 but of course even though we seem like the stronger team you have to be cautious in games like these we have to take both games seriously
392095 since we have been living here there have been two deaths of english men whose wives chose to bury them here i think it was the husbands wish to be buried here the first service was attended by friends and family only there was no officiating religious person at that time there was no plot for non muslim people to be buried in turun the mayor did a wonderful job of providing a suitable place the second service was attended by the turun imam who said a few words
392096 the chinese people very much treasures this valuable opportunity we have only one wish that is to make the beijing olympics a global sports gathering a success
392097 its only inevitable that people from different countries and regions of the world dont see eye to eye on certain issues i dont think politicizing the olympic games will do any good to address these issues
392098 it runs counter to the olympic spirit and also to the shared aspirations of the people of the world
392099 as always we will continue to provide facilities for foreign journalists coming to china to report
392100 of course we also hope the foreign reporters will abide by chinese laws and regulations we also hope you will provide objective reports of what you see here
392101 it has done so by attempting to make sure that everything would be stable and implementing a range of measures like tightening controls on the chinese press putting rights activists under arrest and by generally over reacting in a bureaucratic way
392102 the implication is that foreign journalists should refrain from reporting stories that the government finds critical
392103 this is not far from being a veiled threat to foreign journalists given the assault on foreign media during the tibetan crisis when foreign media were accused of being biased
392104 ive heard that the issue has been resolved and i am very happy about that promises were made about a free internet and we are glad to hear that they are going to be respected
392105 i dont know who did the deal i am still finding out
392106 whoever was involved in that shift that position should have been made known to the international media community i am disappointed because i have learned in corporate life that you dont deliver surprises to constituents and the media is a key constituent at the olympics
392107 in the light of this positive test the italian national olympic committee has excluded the athlete from the olympic team
392108 pwa brings its own referees and the worlds best professionals also the best turkish windsurfers join competitions
392109 it is very easy to organize a race here i mean we have everything for a competition in ala at since the infrastructure is ready competition area is designated easily there are very few places ideal for windsurfing and ala at is one of them
392110 we are trying our best to represent our country this is an important organization for us too windsurfers who join the ifcas official world championship also compete here to win the reward and also to keep fit we are fortunate that ala at is hosting such an event because we know the competition course very well and the entrants are our friends i will host some of them at my house
392111 we have been writing to the local administration the governors office and the state haydraulic works or ds for years
392112 we asked them not to change the direction of the rivers and the brooks flowing into the lake bafa the main source of income to local people however we could not make our voice heard
392113 the mosses on the lakebed have begun to erode away and a strong stink spreads around and the fish in the lake die as a result
392114 the villagers and the tourists staying in the guesthouses or coming to eat at the restaurants around the lake leave the district a natural disaster cries out i am coming but nobody hears the outcry
392115 the fish have begun to die while the lake birds leave the district as a result of the stink swamp and the dying natural life however it is not that easy for the local people to leave those who did not hear the outcry of the villagers at the time are now trying to cover up the natural disaster and are taking samples
392116 i prepared a report called the lake bafa is about to die and sent it to parliament and the related ministries five years ago emphasizing that urgent measures should be taken
392117 we live in a primitive society that demolishes its historical and natural beauty for more profit without feeling any pity for nature
392118 the lakes link with the b y k menderes river the pivot of the district was cut by the hand of the state in order to irrigate the s ke plain the directions of the natural brooks feeding the lake were changed and the local olive oil producing firms were allowed to release their waste into the lake to make the things worse
392119 the legal penalties are not enough to solve the existing problem more drastic measures should be taken immediately to save the lake
392120 we as the state will do our best to save the beautiful lake bafa it is also important that both the citizens and the companies be sensitive to the issue
392121 the environment commission that we have recently founded will do the necessary work taking samples and sending them to zmir in order for the investigations to start
392122 given the portable nature of the ds were encouraging fans of the game to meet exchange tracks and race against each other directly
392123 this is one of the biggest fires in antalyas history in terms of area effected but definitely the biggest in terms of damage it has caused
392124 the fires are still going on by the effect of the strong wind we fear that the interior areas of the region will also be affected
392125 it is rather difficult to estimate the loss of property or the exact amount of land affected now however it seems that more than 1 000 hectares of land has been destroyed
392126 the houses in the area in danger have been vacated in order to prevent any loss of life however this caused an air of panic
392127 the area is covered by such heavy smoke that it is getting more and more difficult to control the fires by both the land and the air routes we have mobilized all our sources to control the fires
392128 the meteorologists have stated that the wind will reduce in the afternoon then we will be able to intervene in the area more affectively
392129 we do not lack the professional fire gang and engines conversely all the roads leading up the area are full of our fire teams there is no need for more aids and firemen for now
392130 the aspendos area is not in danger unlike what some media reported however the heavy smoke may be observed from there
392131 the shelters in the park will be suitable for wildlife so the animals will be very happy

392154 it was reported with so much fanfare in feb this year that finally the first alp phone is going to be launcheded by orange and samsung this june now it is already july and samsung just released its i900 omnia where is the i800
392155 just so you know the samsung i800 has been withdrawn since the original project was defined back in february there have been a number of advances in mobile technology
392156 as a consequence the samsung i800 has been withdrawn in order to take advantage of these to prepare a more competitive linux mobile orange is still committed to mobilising linux technology and supporting the limo platform as a uniform open source based software platform

392160 nude scenes on film dont faze me for my art i would do a lot
392161 it really is an authentic portrayal of what i do i do everything from housekeeping to looking after my kids i dont have a nanny i juggle a pretty crazy career
392162 i direct a lot of it film a lot of it and im in the editing room all the time
392163 ive been approached to do these shows since they were invented and it eventually evolved into this
392164 they asked for water but i told them there was none i knew they were coming to look for what they could steal they came back later and loaded the metal on to a wheelbarrow to take to the nearby scrap dealer
392165 i shouted at them but they said they were going to beat me up when they came back for more metal
392166 comes out of frustrations that i experienced both as a diplomat and as a policy maker in the congress
392167 to put a lot of pressure on the leaders in a conflict to come to the table to sign agreements but we do nothing to really work directly with their mindsets
392168 there is no reason therefore to believe that the day after they have signed an agreement they would see their conflict or each other any differently than the day before they signed that agreement and so it is not surprising that within five years most societies that have signed agreements are back at war
392169 we do not think it is very useful to lecture people to preach to them about human rights or about democracy the challenge is to get people to begin to comprehend their interdependence to see each other as part of the same political universe so that they will not dehumanise their adversaries
392170 huge gap between the political class and the mass of the population

392217 its wonderful and i love to paint and draw everyone in my family has always painted
392218 and when i saw that storm coming in that happened the same day as the big lismore hailstorm i thought this is something serious so i took a photo and painted it
392219 i could name a genuine first grade side that could probably win it the premiership theyre just out injured
392220 off the top of my head ill start from the front row ross larson and choppy kahn
392221 in the second row we have heath johnson and marcus mccormack
392222 you normally get the knocks and bruises and have a week off here and there but these ones are season ending
392223 you could whinge and whinge all the time but that doesnt change anything were not the only ones affected grafton and ballina are in the same boat
392224 mcdonald and corrigan are zone players coes been playing grade football in brisbane and barnes is a nsw country rep
392225 the morale goes down but theyve dug in and done pretty well thats all they can do
392226 a lot of young blokes have put their hands up
392227 shaun makings is on fire hes really held the team together
392228 wade sweeney has been going all right brok doohan and michael barnes have come through from the juniors
392229 im a draftsman so i drew it up on the computer to make sure it was all structurally sound
392230 i got the idea from a movie called troy and its made from marine grade canvas tarpaulin and bamboo and a lot of rope
392231 im directing traffic and camp goers because a lot of people get confused about where theyre staying
392232 i only work the one day and then i get my ticket and have the whole weekend to enjoy the festival
392233 if we stick to our game plan and maintain our intensity i think the boys are strong enough mentally and physically to end stars run
392234 ballinas always tough at home and theyre in good form so we know itll be a tough one but the boys are playing well and want to maintain the momentum
392235 while we know therell be pressure on brad in goals he has plenty of premier league experience from a few years ago and im sure hell take the opportunity to prove his worth
392236 we need to keep winning to stay in the mix and after all the effort the boys have put in all year its not the time to slacken off
392237 theyre a fast young side like us and itll be close but we have some confidence back after breaking our goal drought with two goals against goonellabah mid week
392238 its a huge challenge for the boys against pottsville and were probably only a 10 per cent chance of survival from here
392239 the bullying started in year 4 when i was diagnosed with diabetes i was getting called a diabetic loser and people said i was wagging because i had to leave the classroom to get my injections
392240 the bullies were only one or two people who thought it was cool to pick on me but it made me feel really upset
392241 when i was diagnosed i kept thinking why me i had enough to deal with without having to worry about bullies
392242 after that a lot of people understood my problem and realised it wasnt my fault
392243 i would say the most important thing is to tell your teachers and your parents youve got to get people to help dont try to cope with it alone
392244 i took her out of the school because that was the only avenue to stop the bullying i had to move her out of the entire lismore educational zone to protect her
392245 kadina high school fully investigated this former students bullying claims
392246 liam didnt want to go to school it affected his confidence and he became very emotional
392247 i think bullying is wider spread than you might think
392248 our counsellor is really nice and people go there to talk
392249 the haughton family and the aaliyah memorial fund would like to thank all of aaliyahs fans for their continuous love and support in keeping the legacy of aaliyah alive during these past 6 years
392250 im not like those glamour girls who say im really dirty im really bad then just pose around i really am dirty and bad i love sex
392251 im an angel in the courtroom and a whore in the bedroom
392252 you lot are the most ridiculous looking men i have ever seen in my life
392253 you know danny devito could pull me if he made me laugh was confident and a bit sexy
392254 abi titmuss shes been tied to more bed posts than david blunketts dog
392255 it was really difficult to say no to her invite back to bed
392256 then i should probably stop looking for a book that isnt here and get out of your hair so you can close up
392257 thank you but well see you back next month right
392258 well he told me that his son was supposed to come and help
392259 but the way he makes it sound his sons a lazy piece of shit who doesnt want to do anything more than he already does so the idea of his son being here is pretty laughable at best
392260 im the lazy piece of shit son that was supposed to come and help you
392261 well now this is one of those moments where im supposed to put my foot in my mouth and regret what i just said
392262 i hope you realize that im not going to give two shits who you are or what you do or can do to me i was told one thing and then you decide to make sure that whatever was said wasnt true good for you
392263 well seeing you as happy as you are doing the things you do makes me believe that with the right kind of help in my endeavors i can have what you have in my own way
392264 you have a talent and you need to keep doing it
392265 my old friend the only talent that i have at the moment is bouncing from man to man because i cant seem to find one who can fathom the things hed need to in order to stay with me
392266 i cant have you dropping things on a whim just so that you can come all the way over here to help me by deriving a story for me
392267 which is one of the reasons you called me looking to see if i could help
392268 you need to stop worrying ive finally after all these years arrived with the band ive worked for
392269 our latest photo shoot this past saturday we all dressed up in pinstripe slacks ties hats etc
392270 im inclined to believe it because you dont ever really lie but i cant see it
392271 and to hear our new stuff the best stuff on tracy lane has ever released
392272 i actually listen to stuff thats nothing close to otl
392273 well that narrows it down to a great many from both what you would refer to as old school to this day and age
392274 are there any other kinds of influential groups out there that have helped or make you want to do what you do that much better
392275 i cant knock anyone for wanting more of something that they love
392276 if they start hurting themselves or someone else then yes they must have their cocks pulled off or tits savagely eaten
392277 i tend to lean more toward the democratic party most of the time
392278 i may picture them all beating off or imagine what their tits and limp cocks look like
392279 i may have neurons firing on occasion and have thoughts of killing the ones i dont like but i would never do it
392280 i have darryn to dream tattooed on my left arm and a half sleeve of tats on my right arm more soon
392281 well as our friend here seems to be interested in what may or may not have influenced us in our lives
392282 what would you say has managed to help put you where you are now
392283 the big events have been moments with family or highlights of my musical journey
392284 seriously most fans and the guys in my band think i am between twenty seven all they way to thirty two so i try to keep it that way because im just a big kid at heart
392285 i love batting cages go karts driving range pool bowling etc
392286 a friend of mine came to stay with me for a week or two and during that time we caught up with each other on what we were doing in our personal lives and im telling you right here and now that after hearing his story i dont see how you guys can do what you do
392287 im almost afraid to ask what you mean by do what we do
392288 im just saying at as i listened to him telling me the relationship history he had going on i just sat there looking at him
392289 i wanted to ask him a million questions and i knew i could without insulting him but i couldnt ask him because of what he told me
392290 please tell me you at the very least asked him to do something sexual with you to give him a glimmer of hope
392291 ive told you before that if i ever wanted to go down that road ive got a list of people i have to do it with
392292 ive got you high on the list to beat my meat for me
392293 well then youre going to have to go down a little so i can get the kissing out of the way so that i can do it in order
392294 it was a great story filled with lessons and all the things you were going for
392295 are we going to be graced with the pleasure of knowing it
392296 i could tell you his first name but it might be a name that gets tossed around since im just the second in a line of story tellers and even if i told you his first name youd want to know his last name
392297 so what happens if you give us his full name
392298 well i can honestly say that it wont diminish him as a person
392299 as a matter of fact his ego might even swell at the idea that a group of good looking guys and a woman who loves gay men might want to get to know him but im pretty sure you guys wouldnt want to give him the time of day
392300 well its refreshing to know hes gay and not straight
392301 and as a straight man i can say that im not the kind of straight man whos stupid enough to think that one gay mans automatically going to like another gay man as a brother or as a friend which is why im not sure youd like this guy because he takes the term cynical to a whole new level and rules his own little world with it
392302 well since you describe him like that then how can we not want to meet him
392303 well then you can ask me his full name and then his email address along with his phone number when its all said and done you can then choose what method you want to use to get in touch with him and see where it goes
392304 but let me just tell you this here and now ive warned you now will warn you with the story and then warn you again after the story that sound fair
392305 it might help in case i ever decide to write a novel
392306 well then in his honor try to give it one
392307 with the way inflation is going now people will be cutting back on costs and walking to their local store people are coming back to their corner store

392397 the new narcissist is haunted not by guilt but by anxiety he seeks not to inflict his own certainties on others but to find a meaning in life liberated from the superstitions of the past he doubts even the reality of his own existence his sexual attitudes are permissive rather than puritanical even though his emancipation from ancient taboos brings him no sexual peace fiercely competitive in his demand for approval and acclaim he distrusts competition because he associates it unconsciously with an unbridled urge to destroy he harbours deeply antisocial impulses he praises respect for rules and regulations in the secret belief that they do not apply to himself acquisitive in the sense that his cravings have no limits he demands immediate gratification and lives in a state of restless perpetually unsatisfied desire

392575 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
392576 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
392577 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
392578 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato
392579 hai lambizione di crescere professionalmente del resto perch non dovrebbe essere cos ci non significa necessariamente che sei disposto a sacrificare ogni istante della tua esistenza per il lavoro hai linnata capacit di saperti adattare alle circostanze non esiti a sacrificarti per raggiungere ottimi risultati ma il tuo tempo libero e i tuoi interessi sono sacri composto

392584 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona

392606 then my husband relayed the story to me and it clicked
392607 he told me that when he was younger he had an imaginary friend he named him paul after himself but he and his friend werent brothers so imaginary paul obviously had to have a different last name

392627 i want the campers to understand not to let their injuries hold them back life can be good
392628 it makes me want to go to the kids school and beat that bully up

392688 i wanted to have access to a car for moving stuff and occasionally going to ikea to get things or for a big load of groceries a three or four hour use costs about 15
392689 its located right across the street so i can see if theres a car available when i want one the first year we had our membership we used it at least a couple of times a month even to just go out and see friends in the suburbs and up to markham where it would be more inconvenient to take transit
392690 once people join autoshare they drive less because they realize they dont need a car as much as they thought and they break the habit
392691 the growth is very strong right now were coming up to our 10th year in the city and it took a couple of years for us to get to 300 people
392692 once we unexpectedly ended up using a van for three separate time blocks within a day and spent far more than if we had planned in advance to just get one for the whole day

392701 we need forward thinkers we need people to constantly challenge what we do what we think how we build
392702 we have to follow rules we have to follow regulations pieces of legislation
392703 there are things in place that keep us on a very narrow track going in one particular direction but if we could get the forward thinkers to work with some of the people that build our laws and regulations and allow us to open up and to be much more free thinking without everybody worrying about getting sued

392820 at the higher level of evolutionary transition between basic morphological designs gradualism has always been in trouble though it remains the official position of most western evolutionists smooth intermediates between baupl ne body plans are almost impossible to construct even in thought experiments there is certainly no evidence for them in the fossil record curious mosaics like archaeopteryx do not count even so convinced a gradualist as g g simpson 1944 invoked quantum evolution and inadaptive phases to explain these transitions
392821 in example after example simpson saw that new groups seemed to appear suddenly in the fossil record new higher taxa such as whales mammalian order cetacea bats order chiroptera or even the lineage of grass grazing horses that evolved from leaf browsing ancestors all made sudden appearances seldom was there a long series of intermediate forms that could be traced back through the tens of millions of years that such large scale evolution would seem to call for moreover simpson saw that these new groups first appear pretty much in recognizable form as one might expect they were primitive in certain ways as whales for example they bore serrated teeth and still retained a pair of pelvic flippers but those earliest whales were by no means half way between a four legged terrestrial mammalian ancestor and a modern sperm whale they were much more like the latter than the former bats offer an even more dramatic example the earliest ones known also from the eocene epoch have not only wings but also the distinctive inner ear apparatus to show that echolocation had already evolved and here is the kicker the earliest whales simpson knew about are some 55 million years old if one could devise some sort of measure of rate of evolutionary change the rate of change within whales over the past 55 million years would seem to be slow to moderate if that rate were then extrapolated back to encompass the far greater anatomical changes between the earliest whales and their wholly terrestrial four legged mammalian ancestors we would have to place the beginnings of whale evolution hundreds of millions of years back in geological time and that is a patent absurdity as placental mammals of any kind had appeared at most only a few tens of millions of years prior to the advent of the earliest whales

392854 for the study of these problems it is the great defect of paleontology that it cannot directly determine any of the cryptogenetic factors that must after all be instrumental in the evolution of populations fossil animals cannot be brought into the laboratory for the experimental determination of their genetic constitutions the experiments have been done by nature without controls and under conditions too complex and variable for sure and simple analysis on the other hand experimental biology in general and genetics in particular have the grave defect that they cannot reproduce the vast and complex horizontal extent of the natural environment and particularly the immense span of time in which population changes really occur they may reveal what happens to a hundred rats in the course of ten years under fixed and simple conditions but not what happened to a billion rats in the course of ten million years under the fluctuating conditions of earth history obviously the latter problem is much more important the work of geneticists on phenogenetics and still more on population genetics is almost meaningless unless it does have a bearing in this broader scene some students not particularly paleontologists conclude that it does not that the phenomena revealed by experimental studies are relatively insignificant in evolution as a whole that major problems cannot now be studied at all in the laboratory and that macro evolution differs qualitatively as well as quantitatively from the micro evolution of the experimentalist
392855 as a matter of personal philosophy i do not here mean to endorse an entirely mechanistic or materialistic view of the life processes i suspect that there is a great deal in the universe that never will be explained in such terms and much that may be inexplicable on a purely physical plane but scientific history conclusively demonstrates that the progress of knowledge rigidly requires that no nonphysical postulate ever be admitted in connection with the study of physical phenomena we do not know what is and what is not explicable in physical terms and the researcher who is seeking explanations must seek physical explanations only or the two kinds can never be disentangled personal opinion is free in the field where this search has so far failed but this is no proper guide in the search and no part of science
392856 micro evolution involves mainly changes within potentially continuous populations and there is little doubt that its materials are those revealed by genetic experimentation macro evolution involves the rise and divergence of discontinuous groups and it is still debatable whether it differs in kind or only in degree from microevolution if the two proved to be basically different the innumerable studies of micro evolution would become relatively unimportant and would have minor value in the study of evolution as a whole
392857 if the term macro evolution is applied to the rise of taxonomic groups that are at or near the minimum level of genetic discontinuity species and genera the large scale evolution studied by the paleontologist might be called mega evolution a hybrid word but so is macro evolution the assumption as in goldschmidts work that mega evolution and macroevolution are the same in all respects is no more justified than the assumption so violently attacked by goldschmidt and others that microevolution and macro evolution differ only in degree as will be shown the paleontologist has more reason to believe in a qualitative distinction between macro evolution and mega evolution than in one between microevolution and macro evolution
392858 the facts are that many species and genera indeed the majority do appear suddenly in the record differing sharply and in many ways from any earlier group and that this appearance of discontinuity becomes more common the higher the level until it is virtually universal as regards orders and all higher steps in the taxonomic hierarchy the face of the record thus does really suggest normal discontinuity at all levels most particularly at high levels and some paleontologists e g spath and schindewolf insist on taking the record at this face value
392859 the levels to which these conclusions apply without modification are approximately those discussed as macro evolution under that or an equivalent term by neozoologists and biologists on still higher levels those of what is here called mega evolution the inferences might still apply but caution is enjoined because here essentially continuous transitional sequences are not merely rare but are virtually a bsent these large discontinuities are less numerous so that paleontological examples of their origin should also be less numerous but their absence is so nearly universal that it cannot offhand be imputed entirely to chance and does require some attempt at special explanation as has been felt by most paleontologists
392860 this is true of all the thirty two orders of mammals and in most cases the break in the record is still more striking than in the case of the perissodactyls for which a known earlier group does at least provide a good structural ancestry the earliest and most primitive known members of every order already have the basic ordinal characters and in no case is an approximately continuous sequence from one order to another known in most cases the break is so sharp and the gap so large that the origin of the order is speculative and much disputed of course the orders all converge backward in time to different degrees the earliest known members are much more alike than the latest known members and there is little doubt for instance but that all the highly diverse ungulates did have a common ancestry but the line making actual connection with such an ancestry is not known in even one instance
392861 this regular absence of transitional forms is not confined to mammals but is an almost universal phenomenon as has long been noted by paleontologists it is true of almost all orders of all classes of animals both vertebrate and invertebrate a fortiori it is also true of the classes themselves and of the major animal phyla and it is apparently also true of analogous categories of plants among genera and species some apparent regularity of absence of transitional types is clearly a taxonomic artifact artificial divisions between taxonomic units are for practical reasons established where random gaps exist this does not adequately explain the systematic occurrence of the gaps between larger units in the cases of the gaps that are artifacts the effect of discovery has been to reveal their random nature and has tended to fill in now one now another now from the ancestral and now from the descendent side in most cases discoveries relating to the major breaks have produced a more or less tenuous extension backward of the descendent groups leaving the probable contact with the ancestry a sharp boundary none of these large breaks has actually been filled by real continuous sequences of fossils although many of them can be exactly located and the transitions described by inference from the improved record on both sides in addition to the fact that they exist there are other more or less systematic features of these discontinuities of record that call for attention and require explanation
392862 in the early days of evolutionary paleontology it was assumed that the major gaps would be filled in by further discoveries and even falsely that some discoveries had already filled them as it became more and more evident that the great gaps remained despite wonderful progress in finding the members of lesser transitional groups and progressive lines it was no longer satisfactory to impute this absence of objective data entirely to chance the failure of paleontology to produce such evidence was so keenly felt that a few disillusioned naturalists even decided that the theory of organic evolution or of general organic continuity of descent was wrong after all
392863 j arthur thomson felt constrained to devote a considerable part of his work to presentation of proofs of the truth of evolution this would be a waste of time now ample proof has been repeatedly presented and is available to anyone who really wants to know the truth it is a human peculiarity occasionally endearing but more often maddening that no amount of proof suffices to convince those who simply do not want to know or to accept the truth reiteration for the sake of these wishful thinkers would be futile and reiteration for those who do want to know the truth is quite unnecessary because they already know it or can easily find it in earlier works in the present study the factual truth of organic evolution is taken as established and the enquiry goes on from there
392864 the meaning of evolution a study of the history of life and of its significance for man
392865 above the level of the virus if that be granted status as an organism the simplest living unit is almost incredibly complex it has become commonplace to speak of evolution from ameba to man as if the ameba were a natural and simple beginning of the process on the contrary if as must almost necessarily be true short of miracles life arose as a living molecule or protogene the progression from this stage to that of the ameba is at least as great as from ameba to man
392866 natural selection as it was understood in darwinian days emphasized the struggle for existence and the survival of the fittest these concepts had ethical ideological and political repercussions which were and continue to be in some cases unfortunate to say the least even modern students of evolution have not always fully corrected the misconceptions arising from these slogans it should now be clear that the process does not depend on existence or surviving certainly not as this applies to individuals and not even in any intensive or explanatory way as it applies to populations or species it depends on differential reproduction which is a different matter altogether it does not favor the fittest flatly and just so unless you care to circle around and define fittest as those that do have most offspring it does favor those that have more offspring this usually means those best adapted to the conditions in which they find themselves or those best able to meet opportunity or necessity for adaptation to other existing conditions which may or may not mean that they are fittest according to understanding of that word moreover the correlation between those having more offspring and therefore really favored by natural selection and those best adapted or best adapting to change is neither perfect nor invariable it is only approximate and usual
392867 it is however the word struggle that has led to most serious misunderstanding of the process of natural selection along with a host of related phrases and ideas nature red in fang and claw class struggle as a natural and desirable element in societal evolution and all the rest struggle inevitably carries the connotation of direct and conscious combat such combat does occur in nature to be sure and it may have some connection with differential reproduction a puma and a deer may struggle one to kill and the other to avoid being killed if the puma wins it eats and presumably may thereby be helped to produce offspring while the deer dies and will never reproduce again two stags may struggle in rivalry for does and the successful combatant may then reproduce while the loser does not even such actual struggles may have only slight effects on reproduction although they will on an average tend to exercise some selective influence the deer most likely to be killed by the puma is too old to reproduce if the puma does not get the deer it will eat something else the losing stag finds other females or a third enjoys the does while the combat rages between these two
392868 to generalize from such incidents that natural selection is over all and even in a figurative sense the outcome of struggle is quite unjustified under the modern understanding of the process struggle is sometimes involved but it usually is not and when it is it may even work against rather than toward natural selection advantage in differential reproduction is usually a peaceful process in which the concept of struggle is really irrelevant it more often involves such things as better integration into the ecological situation maintenance of a balance of nature more efficient utilization of available food better care of the young elimination of intragroup discords struggles that might hamper reproduction exploitation of environmental possibilities that are not the objects of competition or are less effectively exploited by others
392869 the word competition used in discussion here and previously may also carry anthropomorphic undertones and then be subject to some of these same objections it may however and in this connection it must be understood without necessary implication of active competitive behavior competition in evolution often or usually is entirely passive it could conceivably occur without the competing forms ever coming into sight or contact
392870 it is thus likely to say the least that major as well as minor changes in evolution have occurred gradually and that the same forces are at work in each case nevertheless there is a difference and many of the major changes cannot be considered as simply caused by longer continuation of the more usual sorts of minor changes for one thing there is excellent evidence that evolution involving major changes often occurs with unusual rapidity although as we have seen there is no good evidence that it ever occurs instantaneously the rate of evolution of the insectivore forelimb into the bat wing to give just one striking example must have been many times more rapid than any evolution of the bat wing after it had arisen the whole record attests that the origin of a distinctly new adaptive type normally occurs at a much higher rate than subsequent progressive adaptation and diversification within that type the rapidity of such shifts from one adaptive level or equilibrium to another has suggested the name quantum evolution under which i have elsewhere discussed this phenomenon at greater length
392871 scientists often display a human failing whenever they get hold of some new bit of truth they are inclined to decide that it is the whole truth thus the neo darwinians insisted their natural selection was the whole truth of evolution the neo lamarckians held that interaction of structure function environment was the whole truth the vitalists saw the whole truth in the creative aspect of life processes and the finalists found all basic truth in the directional nature of evolution similarly many of the early geneticists although they soon learned far more about the mechanism involved accepted de vries thesis and concluded that mutation was the whole truth of evolution mutations are random so it was decided that evolution is random the problem of adaptation was in their opinion solved by abolishing it they proclaimed that there is no adaptation only chance preadaptation other theories had often stumbled over the fact that there is quite plainly a random element in evolution the nature of which had been unknown now the mutationists had identified the source of this random element but their theory stumbled over the fact that evolution is not wholly random the vitalists and finalists were right in continuing to insist on this point although they were wrong in their own overgeneralization of insisting that the directional element is universal and in maintaining that this element is inherent in life or in its goal the mutationist discoveries were bewildering to many field naturalists and paleontologists because they in particular were well aware that evolution cannot be a purely random process and that progressive adaptation certainly does occur for a time the discoveries of the geneticists seemed only to make confusion worse confounded defeatism and escapism spread among many students of evolution one very eminent vertebrate paleontologist ended a lifetime of study of evolution with the conclusion that he did not after all know anything about its causes another decided in the declining years of his prolonged and exceptionally fertile studies of the subject that good and bad angels must be directing evolution in fact as the geneticists studies progressed they were providing the last major piece of the truth so long sought regarding the causes of evolution
392872 the resulting synthetic theory has often been called neo darwinian even by those who have helped to develop it because its first glimmerings arose from confrontation of the darwinian idea of natural selection with the facts of genetics the term is however a misnomer and doubly confusing in this application the full blown theory is quite different from darwins and has drawn its materials from a variety of sources largely non darwinian and partly anti darwinian even natural selection in this theory has a sense distinctly different although largely developed from the darwinian concept of natural selection
392873 this is not to say that the whole mystery has been plumbed to its core or even that it ever will be the ultimate mystery is beyond the reach of scientific investigation and probably of the human mind there is neither need nor excuse for postulation of nonmaterial intervention in the origin of life the rise of man or any other part of the long history of the material cosmos yet the origin of that cosmos and the causal principles of its history remain unexplained and inaccessible to science here is hidden the first cause sought by theology and philosophy the first cause is not known and i suspect that it never will be known to living man we may if we are so inclined worship it in our own ways but we certainly do not comprehend it
392874 although many details remain to be worked out it is already evident that all the objective phenomena of the history of life can be explained by purely materialistic factors they are readily explicable on the basis of differential reproduction in populations the main factor in the modern conception of natural selection and of the mainly random interplay of the known processes of heredity
392875 man is the result of a purposeless and materialistic process that did not have him in mind he was not planned he is a state of matter a form of life a sort of animal and a species of the order primates akin nearly or remotely to all of life and indeed to all that is material it is however a gross misrepresentation to say that he is just an accident or nothing but an animal among all the myriad forms of matter and of life on the earth or as far as we know in the universe man is unique he happens to represent the highest form of organization of matter and energy that has ever appeared recognition of this kinship with the rest of the universe is necessary for understanding him but his essential nature is defined by qualities found nowhere else not by those he has in common with apes fishes trees fire or anything other than himself
392876 there really is no point nowadays in continuing to collect and to study fossils simply to determine whether or not evolution is a fact the question has been decisively answered in the affirmative there are still those who deny this of course there are still some who deny that the earth is round it is no use gathering more evidence to persuade these doubters because the evidence already in hand has convinced everyone who ever really studied it anyone who cannot or will not accept or attempt to understand this evidence is not likely to have the will or the ability to evaluate new facts of the same sort

392878 nevertheless darwins theory still had some serious imperfections that prevented its being accepted by many students of evolution the theory explained why unfit or inadaptive types of organisms tend to be eliminated but it did not seem adequately to explain the much more important origin of more fit better adapted organisms it also failed to explain why evolution is not completely adaptive why different types of organisms may evolve even though their relationships with the environment seem to be exactly the same why adaptation is seldom or never perfect and why non adaptive characters those not involved in adaptation and inadaptive characters those opposed to harmonious adaptation do often arise in evolution these features of evolution were not well explained by the older forms of darwinian theory and their reality was abundantly demonstrated by critics of darwin
392879 moreover it is a fact that discontinuities are almost always and systematically present at the origin of really high categories and like any other systematic feature of the record this requires explanation there remains however the point that for still higher categories discontinuity of appearance in the record is not only frequent but if also systematic some break in continuity always occurs in categories from orders upwards at least although the break may not be large or appear significant to most students
392880 darwin also considers the argument that the subject of evolution was in the air that mens minds were prepared for it we may note that even if this was so it would not explain why darwin was the individual who plucked evolution out of the air or how he accomplished the feat darwin himself rejected the argument out of hand because as he wrote he never happened to come across a single naturalist who seemed to doubt about the permanence of species and he acknowledged no debt to his predecessors these are extraordinary statements they cannot be literally true yet darwin cannot be consciously lying and he may therefore be judged unconsciously misleading naive forgetful or all three his own grandfather erasmus darwin whose work charles knew very well was a pioneer evolutionist darwin was also familiar with the work of lamarck and had certainly met at least a few naturalists who had flirted with the idea of evolution he actually specifies one elsewhere in the autobiography a robert edmund grant professor at the university of london of all this darwin says that none of these forerunners had any effect on him then in almost the next breath he admits that hearing evolutionary views supported and praised rather early in life may have favored his upholding them later
392881 it is a feature of the known fossil record that most taxa appear abruptly they are not as a rule led up to by a sequence of almost imperceptibly changing forerunners such as darwin believed should be usual in evolution a great many sequences of two or a few temporally intergrading species are known but even at this level most species appear without known immediate ancestors and really long perfectly complete sequences of numerous species are exceedingly rare sequences of genera immediately successive or nearly so at that level not necessarily represented by the exact populations involved in the transition from one genus to the next are more common and may be longer than known sequences of species but the appearance of a new genus in the record is usually more abrupt than the appearance of a new species the gaps involved are generally larger that is when a new genus appears in the record it is usually well separated morphologically from the most nearly similar other known genera this phenomenon becomes more universal and more intense as the hierarchy of categories is ascended gaps among known species are sporadic and often small gaps among known orders classes and phyla are systematic and almost always large
392882 evolution after darwin the evolution of life its origin history and future
392883 the fact not theory that evolution has occurred and the darwinian theory as to how it has occurred have become so confused in popular opinion that the distinction must be stressed the distinction is also particularly important for the present subject because the effects on the world in which we live have been distinct the greatest impact no doubt has come from the fact of evolution it must color the whole of our attitude toward life and toward our selves and hence our whole perceptual world that is however a single step essentially taken a hundred years ago and now a matter of simple rational acceptance or superstitious rejection how evolution occurs is much more intricate still incompletely known debated in detail and the subject of most active investigation at present
392884 this view of life the world into which darwin led us
392885 the import of the fact of evolution depends on how far evolution extends and here there are two crucial points does it extend from the inorganic into the organic and does it extend from the lower animals to man in the origin of species darwin implies that life did not arise naturally from nonliving matter for in the very last sentence he wrote life having been originally breathed by the creator into a few forms or into one the words by the creator were inserted in the second edition and are one of many gradual concessions made to critics of that book later however darwin conjectured he did not consider this scientific that life will be found to be a consequence of some general law that is to be a result of natural processes rather than divine intervention he referred to this at least three times in letters unpublished until after his death the one from which i have quoted being the last letter he ever wrote 28 march 1882 to g c wallich darwin died three weeks later
392886 until comparatively recently many probably most biologists agreed with darwin that the problem of the origin of life was not yet amenable to scientific study now however almost all biologists agree that the problem can be attacked scientifically the consensus is that life did arise naturally from the nonliving and that even the first living things were not specially created the conclusion has indeed really become inescapable for the first steps in that process have already been repeated in several laboratories there is concerted study from geochemical biochemical and microbiological approaches at a meeting in chicago in 1959 a highly distinguished international panel of experts was polled all considered the experimental production of life in the laboratory imminent and one maintained that this had already been done his opinion was not based on a disagreement about the facts but depended on the definition of just where in a continuous sequence life can be said to begin
392887 at the other end of the story it was evident to evolutionists from the start that man cannot be an exception in the origin of species darwin deliberately avoided the issue saying only in closing light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history yet his adherents made no secret of the matter and at once embroiled darwin with themselves in arguments about mans origin from monkeys twelve years later in 1871 darwin published the descent of man which makes it clear that he was indeed of that opinion no evolutionist has since seriously questioned that man did originate by evolution some notably the wallace who shared with darwin the discovery of natural selection have maintained that special principles not elsewhere operative were involved in human origins but that is decidedly a minority opinion
392888 we feel almost instinctively that there is a pattern the diversity of living creatures is neither complete nor random all living things share many characteristics and above this basic level we observe groups with every degree of resemblance from near identity to great dissimilarity there is or seems to be an essential order or plan among the forms of life in spite of their great multiplicity there seems moreover to be purpose in this plan the resemblances and differences among a fish a bird and a man are meaningful the resemblances adapt them to those conditions and functions that all have in common and the differences to peculiarities in their ways of life not shared with the others it is a habit of speech and thought to say that fishes have gills in order to breathe water that birds have wings in order to fly and that men have brains in order to think
392889 a telescope a telephone or a typewriter is a complex mechanism serving a particular function obviously its manufacturer had a purpose in mind and the machine was designed and built in order to serve that purpose an eye an ear or a hand is also a complex mechanism serving a particular function it too looks as if it had been made for a purpose this appearance of purposefulness is pervading in nature in the general structure of animals and plants in the mechanisms of their various organs and in the give and take of their relationships with each other accounting for this apparent purposefulness is a basic problem for any system of philosophy or of science
392890 adaptation by natural selection as a creative process and pre adaptation in the special senses just explained are the answers of the synthetic theory of evolution to the problem of plan and purpose in nature of course much work remains to be done many details to be filled in and many parts of the process to be more clearly understood but it seems to me and to many others that here at last is the basis for a complete and sound solution of this old and troublesome problem adaptation is real and it is achieved by a progressive and directed process the process is wholly natural in its operation this natural process achieves the aspect of purpose without the intervention of a purposer and it has produced a vast plan without the concurrent action of a planner it may be that the initiation of the process and the physical laws under which it functions had a purposer and that this mechanistic way of achieving a plan is the instrument of a planner of this still deeper problem the scientist as scientist cannot speak
392891 in the face of the universal tendency for order to be lost the complex organization of the living organism can be maintained only if work involving the expenditure of energy is performed to conserve the order the organism is constantly adjusting repairing replacing and this requires energy but the preservation of the complex improbable organization of the living creature needs more than energy for the work it calls for information or instructions on how the energy should be expended to maintain the improbable organization the idea of information necessary for the maintenance and as we shall see creation of living systems is of great utility in approaching the biological problems of reproduction
392892 we have repeatedly emphasized the fundamental problems posed for the biologist by the fact of lifes complex organization we have seen that organization requires work for its maintenance and that the universal quest for food is in part to provide the energy needed for this work but the simple expenditure of energy is not sufficient to develop and maintain order a bull in a china shop performs work but he neither creates nor maintains organization the work needed is particular work it must follow specifications it requires information on how to proceed
392893 as posture is focal for consideration of mans anatomical nature and tools are for consideration of his material culture so is language focal for his mental nature and his non material culture
392894 many other attempts have been made to determine the evolutionary origin of language and all have failed moreover at the present time no languages are primitive in the sense of being significantly close to the origin of language even the peoples with least complex cultures have highly sophisticated languages with complex grammar and large vocabularies capable of naming and discussing anything that occurs in the sphere occupied by their speakers the oldest language that can reasonably be reconstructed is already modern sophisticated complete from an evolutionary point of view

392938 es un jugador representativo del club y creo que tenemos mucho respeto por l y por todos los que tenemos seguramente va a seguir esta competencia desde ahora y hasta que dirija yo al am rica
392939 vamos a poner al que en mejor condiciones est el que rinda m s
392940 las jerarqu as son importantes porque son ejemplos para los m s j venes
392941 me parece que en ning n momento dije que a villa no lo quer a al contrario creo que todos queremos que exista competencia y poner al que mejor est el que m s rinda va a jugar eso est muy claro y respetamos a todos como a castro a rojas a ochoa que es un jugador joven de la selecci n a igo y a todos los dem s porque la competencia existe me gusta es un equipo grande y todos tienen que competir eso es algo que siempre manejo y los jugadores saben que quedan muchos partidos por delante
392942 pero no nos desgastemos en eso debemos mejorar en la parte t ctica en trabajar para que el equipo est cada vez mejor creo que para la prensa nos viene bien todo esto a la prensa le gusta y a m tambi n porque estoy permanentemente hablando con ustedes de estos temas
392943 mucho no explico de las decisiones que tomo pero son profesionales y hablamos de la parte t ctica debemos estar atentos esto reci n empieza como se lo dije a villa y a todos los dem s el torneo va a ser muy competitivo para todos el equipo en general va a tener que responder y queremos continuar con esa metodolog a
392944 tambi n hay jugadores que no est n jugando y muestran mucha disposici n ganas de ser part cipes del equipo las puertas est n abiertas para todos
392945 continuamos con el trabajo cotidiano y a ustedes los vamos a dejar ver las pr cticas para que se den cuenta de lo competitivo que es insisto el que est en mejor condiciones va a jugar eso est bien clarito es una metodolog a que tengo las cosas est n claras desde el inicio para que ninguno tenga dudas
392946 nosotros estamos muy bien el grupo est b rbaro sabemos que tenemos un partido complicado pero vamos a llegar muy bien veo muy s lido a todo el equipo y tengo plena confianza para este juego
392947 s creo que el equipo va a llegar bien le daremos confianza al grupo que viene jugando salvo alg n inconveniente pero seguiremos igual pienso que hay que darles confianza corregir algunos errores ya que los muchachos muestran entusiasmo
392948 comenzar ganando es bueno para el club y para el propio entrenador estamos mejorando cada vez m s y va a ser muy duro jugar contra el am rica
392949 debemos ser protagonistas en cualquier cancha estamos adquiriendo personalidad y entendemos que ser un partido complicado pero sabemos que estamos bien preparados y tengo mucha confianza en mi equipo
392950 veo que el grupo se est adaptando a lo que queremos nosotros a la presi n a ser agresivos y no esperar el toluca ya nos conoce hemos jugado en estados unidos sabe que el am rica es un equipo complicado que t cticamente juega bien y que es inteligente tenemos jugadores con mucha capacidad as que vamos a plantear el partido para ganarlo
392951 no estoy pensando en eso acaba de empezar el torneo y yo no quiero salir me estoy concentrando en trabajar fuerte y en ganarme un lugar quiero jugar pero debo ganarme esa opci n no voy a decir que si no juego me voy
392952 en lo futbol stico est bien y si no lo pone el entrenador sus razones tiene yo respeto eso si villa est contento o no es otra cosa yo estoy del lado del equipo esa situaci n no interfiere con el ambiente o el trabajo del equipo
392953 yo no s si est a gusto o no si villa dijo algo es porque se trata de un icono de la instituci n y est acostumbrado a jugar
392954 dicen que si te rompe el zapato en el escenario es de buena suerte no m s me falta que me orine un perro soy de esas a las que le llueve sobre mojado pero espero que pase no

392960 the mets lost out on raul ibanez and every bullpen arm they chased
392961 the phillies targeted a lefthanded reliever for months and never found one the braves couldnt locate a taker for eminently available will ohman the nationals couldnt find a home for felipe lopez paul lo duca tim redding luis ayala or anyone else on the roster
392962 ill tell you i might take florida to win the east now
392963 arthur rhodes floridas one addition thursday can get those lefthanders on the phillies and mets out something renyel pinto and taylor tankersley couldnt do
392964 and nobody seems to know it but now that theyve got josh johnson and anibal sanchez back theyve got the best starting pitching in the division the phillies and mets have holes they need to address and neither one of them did it
392965 his contract like brian westbrooks is now outdated having outperformed the deal
392966 we have talked to the eagles and would like to work out a contract with them
392967 he wants something done before the season or as soon as possible
392968 im not going to categorize the eagles and their position but theres a sense of urgency on our end
392969 i play football i let him take care of that so whatever he can do its for the better
392970 im perfectly fine this is the year im not going on the disabled list
392971 in the big innings my change up has been up
392972 i havent been able to locate it down thats definitely an issue i need to locate that pitch to have success
392973 dewey was out there with about 10 other mares and foals
392974 we just left dewey out in the field with the others to fend for himself
392975 i talked to my veterinarian janet durso and we made a decision to just let him go and see how he made out he was probably nursing off other mares while he was out there he would dive in and help himself
392976 when he was at the normal weaning age of about six months he was probably a little skinny and pot gutted
392977 within two or three months he looked just like all the rest of the weanlings
392978 we swim him and ride him and keep him happy
392979 deweys been very impressive theres no two ways about it
392980 hes been the dominant horse and he deserves all the accolades and respect
392981 he never gets rattled hes used to being by himself a lot of horses get nervous but he seems like nothing fazes him
392982 look at this passage that demonstrates the inherent violent nature of the religion
392983 we found that both men and women with sleep apnea in the general population not patients mostly undiagnosed and untreated had poorer survival compared with persons without sleep apnea given equal bmi age and sex
392984 i was surprised by how much the risks increased when we excluded people who reported treatment with cpap
392985 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
392986 our purpose was to explore methods of making images of nanoscale objects on the time scale of atomic motions a length and time regime that promises to become accessible with advances in free electron lasers
392987 the technique we used is called massively parallel x ray fourier transform holography with coded apertures what inspired me to try this approach was the pinhole camera
392988 the room had to be dark for the good reason that a sharp image requires a small pinhole but a small pinhole also produces a dim image
392989 to get a brighter image without lenses you have to use many pinholes the problem then becomes how to assemble the information including depth information from the overlapping shadow images this is where coded apertures come in
392990 cmon donovan turn around were right here do it for the kids
392991 it doesnt sound like jim its super clear and easy to hear
392992 i think its going to be a little bit more of a hairy situation in the games with substitutions and personnel well work with it more this week before we go into the preseason game it wasnt bad today
392993 in other words if stewart bradley got hurt and came out of the game wed have to switch helmets omar would have to put the other helmet on
392994 i feel great and im looking forward to coming out here every day and grinding it out and making plays im finally healthy my knees are finally strong i feel like my old self again im just going to try to continue that throughout the camp and throughout the season
392995 we just have to rely on quickness with our ends theres no doubt about it
392996 the provisions of the hyde act and not the assurances made by the indian prime minister in parliament are shaping the course of the indo us nuclear deal through the various stages
392997 that the interpretation of the indian government regarding the corrective measures mentioned in the preamble of the safeguards agreement providing for a check against disruption of fuel supplies does not hold has been made clear by the iaea
392998 this belies the prime ministers assurance in parliament that indias civilian nuclear facilities would be put under perpetual iaea safeguards only under the strictly reciprocal condition of uninterrupted fuel supply guarantee
392999 domestic trade is growing very fast while imports andexports have started to decline

393005 client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats actions plans
393006 he always seemed on the edge the kind of guy who might jump through the ceiling if you said boo to him
393007 almost everybody at riid believes that he has absolutely nothing to do with amerithrax
393008 one thing that im very proud of this team for is that we never want to be fat and happy
393009 we never want to feel that we can sit back and things will take care of themselves
393010 i ran that lap and tony gibson was telling me how awesome it was
393011 i said man if jimmie can beat that he can have the pole
393012 everything every part of every corner nine different things all the way around the track
393013 when everything came down to it this was the situation that was all around the best for lou
393014 not just financially he enjoys the city he enjoys 76ers coach mo cheeks he enjoys his teammates
393015 you go with the flow but you knew they had to spend money on a free agent before they could move on to louis and andre igoudala
393016 we were patient with them we let them go through the elton brand situation they were patient with us as we went out and did our due diligence in finding louis fair market value
393017 you put a lot of time in studying and youll get it
393018 yeah thats why ive got a chip on my shoulder now
393019 i know the game i want to compete i want to be good
393020 there aint no breeze in el paso this is nothing man
393021 i was kind of upset i didnt go earlier in the draft
393022 i was ready to practice right then and there that was the feeling in my heart i was fired up some people took it the wrong way im not a selfish player im a team player more than being a pro bowl player i want to win a super bowl to clear it up thats what i meant
393023 hey im just a pup in this league trying to become a dog
393024 these kind of guys are hard to find and we love to find these guys
393025 the quarterbacks are more accurate than in college thats the main thing
393026 so its timing you look back that much youll get beat
393027 im a veterinarian whos been classifying dogs for 10 years
393028 and when these dna test results started coming back i realized that i didnt know squat
393029 if a dog even winks at you like a pit bull we have to say its a pit bull
393030 the most vicious combination you could imagine the pit bull crossed with the junkyard dog
393031 that would call into question how easy it is to draw conclusions based on breeds
393032 i do a lot of work in southern mexico spaying and neutering real mutty dogs
393033 theres a basic dog type that emerges and she looks pretty close to it
393034 there is no money to pay for this enhanced benefit regardless of the merits

393036 at a time when fuel and energy costs are on the rise even a limited increase will help retirees living on a fixed income
393037 you have to treat the people who have worked for the state for decades fairly a lot of these people worked in the 40s 50s and 60s so they didnt make a lot anyway most of their pensions arent very large
393038 there were varying opinions but no one opposed it i think we did a god job of lobbying truthfully
393039 theres demand for spending on education and transportation infrastructure and what theyve said is were going to allocate this money for retirees
393040 i understand the impulse but i dont think theyve thought through the financial implications
393041 this is something i feel that you have to do
393042 its probably not the best timing but state retirees traditionally have gotten the short end of the stick when it comes to cost of living increases
393043 im going to look like a baby now they got some rules here i dont want them to treat me different than the other guys
393044 i just asked how important it was to him i asked him what he wanted to do hell clean it up a little bit he wants to be treated like everybody else
393045 im not going to waste energy when people talk like that
393046 i want people to judge me on what i do here not what i did in boston whatever happened in boston is in the past when people ask about boston i put my brain on pause
393047 from the bottom of my heart i want to thank the fans of boston
393048 i love you guys youve been with me through ups and downs
393049 i dont think any of his managers coaches or teammates said he wasnt running out balls
393050 his style was the same and they had a lot of success with him
393051 in boston the fans the organization and the teammates were never an issue he preferred another city along the lines of the lifestyle he had in cleveland he enjoyed being in another experience other than the intensity of boston
393052 manny said he didnt want to leave boston i didnt want to leave there were not the only ones that have gone through it theres a track record i played with mo vaughn i played with roger clemens
393053 it just seemed like toward the end if there was a chance a guy wasnt coming back you started hearing more negative stuff about the guy youd hear rumbling about certain people and it seemed like those were the ones who didnt come back
393054 im kind of nervous when i was a little boy in the dominican republic my first baseball uniform was one from the dodgers no 30 so the no 30 has always been my favorite
393055 just come and play and move on im happy to be here la is a great city in boston and now in los angeles ive always had the support of the latinos i feel at home here

393064 the issue of sexual harassment has become less taboo recently in the egyptian media within academic circles and has even become a part of daily discourse among women in egyptian society regardless of social or economic status or political belief
393065 men and women are getting married later so obviously men and women are both sexually frustrated but women have no way of showing their sexual frustration
393066 a combination of religion and politics tells young men and women that unless a woman is covered up she is fair game and now men enact their sexual frustration on women without any sense of shame
393067 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications
393068 its hard to explain a lot of teams have trouble scoring runs at times we scored 20 runs and it seemed like our hitting went cold but at the same time i think we can hit

393080 dairy and other foods that are rich in calcium are thought to be important for the growth and strengthening of bones in children and adolescents
393081 in the us dairy products tend to be the preferred source of calcium since diets that exclude dairy are often deficient in this important nutrient
393082 the new findings show that for those children who have inadequate calcium intake increasing dietary calcium has a significant impact on bone development
393083 since most children dont get enough calcium meeting calcium recommendations may help to prevent future osteoporosis

393106 fishing activities during the quarter was limited to the buying and selling of fish as actual fish catch was suspended due to high operational cost fishing enterprises could not engage in fishing activity given the high cost of petroleum products and fishing gear fish available on the market is obtained through buying of fish on the high seas and selling it on the liberian market

393156 the group faced a few challenges in the period which included the slow down of the us economy as well as the energy challenges in southern africa which mostly affected south africas production
393157 however strong demand from emerging markets coupled with rising prices pushed sales to us 3 7 billion up from us 3 4 billion in the same period last year
393158 fixed assets on the other hand went down slightly from us 3 89 billion to us 3 75 billion while gearing on the other hand increased by 1 percentage point to 49 4 percent
393159 mass market retail diamond jewellery sales have been impacted by economic issues in the us market which accounts for about half of all our diamond sales

393161 smuggling has continued despite a resolution by the east african community ministers to maintain the ban on plastic bags and articles of less than 30 microns and a 120 excise duty

393164 we managed to help rwandan farmers launch a brand of premium coffee in the uk and we have so far helped them launch the brand in 1 000 stores across the united kingdom
393165 in the first half of this year us 15 million frw 8 1 billion was generated from exporting 5 512 tons of coffee this increase is double compared to that of last years us 6 8million frw 3 68 billion when 3 193 tons were exported
393166 rwandas coffee is second to none on the world market rwandans therefore ought to exploit this opportunity and produce more coffee in order to get more foreign exchange out of it
393167 this means that you have known how to use the resources available as they ought to be used if you continue like this we shall feel that dependency on neighbouring countries will decrease still further
393168 coffee is the countrys biggest income earner but its quality is declining due to bad practices this trend must stop or the culprits will be imprisoned
393169 before coffee is exported we carry out cup tests on all the exports at times we are forced to throw away coffee beans that smell of dust

393208 why do you keep asking me the same question again and again although i have told you so many times it is a crow are you not able to understand this
393209 today my little son aged three was sitting with me on the sofa when a crow was sitting on the window my son asked me 23 times what it was and i replied to him all 23 times that it was a crow i hugged him lovingly each time h e asked me the same question again and again for 23 times i did not at all feel irritated i rather felt affection for my innocent child
393210 i want to see my parents happy forever they have cared for me ever since i was a little child they have always showered their selfless love on me they crossed all mountains and valleys without seeing the storm and heat to make me a person presentable in the society today

393217 we wish to take the escalating world food prices as an opportunity for our country to produce more food to meet national demand and export the surplus with that in mind we have initiated a short term strategy to bring quick gains
393218 the utmost goal is to increase fertiliser usage from nine kilogrammes in 2007 2008 to 11 kilogrammes during financial year 2008 2009
393219 for example areas of shinyanga tabora singida dodoma and other parts of mwanza mara and kilimanjaro regions are suitable for production of millet and sorghum
393220 it will be time wasting if farmers from these areas spend their time trying to produce maize
393221 worth noting is that there are only two years remaining for the government to complete the remaining 72 5 per cent the opposition wants the minister to tell this house how he intends to bring about a green revolution without emphasis being put on irrigation
393222 your friend president mwai kibaki appeals to you to continue assisting him just like you have been doing
393223 the maize will be here by the end of this week although it is not enough we expect they tanzania will agree to sell more to us
393224 we decided to buy maize from tanzania because it is cheaper if you add transport costs and this is the best value for our money

393239 we were there to listen as well as to why they are doing what theyre doing

393241 the pct is keen to ensure there is a mature and intelligent discussion on water fluoridation to ensure the public fully understands all of the available health evidence

393266 las religiones tienen algo muy positivo que aportar a la construcci n de un mundo m s pac fico
393267 hay guerras relacionadas con la religi n no porque hay mucha religi n sino porque hay poca religi n y mal entendida y vivida
393268 que la cultura llegue con signos de no violencia y de integraci n son gestos de solidaridad y si algo nos preocupa es ir limando cualquier aspereza por muy dif cil que sea
393269 el programa de este a o del aula de verano constituye un punto de partida que nos coloca como un importante referente cultural el hecho de que se hayan dado cita en la gomera exponentes de las tres grandes religiones es todo un acontecimiento una representaci n de las culturas monote stas y este hecho supone para nosotros todo un regocijo la altura y el nivel del debate han sido lo suficientemente elocuentes como para llegar a los participantes por lo tanto
393270 una primera cuesti n es lo que pueden aportar las distintas religiones a la paz en nuestro mundo muchas veces parece que la religi n m s que ayudar a una convivencia pac fica ha sido y es motivo de enfrentamiento esto creo que tiene lugar cuando una determinada religi n se siente atacada o puesta en cuesti n y empiezan a surgir grupos dentro de esa religi n que sostienen creencias distorsionadas como un fide smo que no deja espacio a la raz n y que lleva a una idea de dios como ser arbitrario y caprichoso que puede exigir cosas contra la dignidad del ser humano
393271 las religiones tienen algo muy positivo que aportar a la construcci n de un mundo m s pac fico
393272 la paz es fruto de estructuras justas pero tambi n de la transformaci n interior del hombre
393273 el ayudar a los hombres a superar su ego smo sus rencores y a perdonar a parecerse a dios compasivo y misericordioso a superar su inautenticidad a ser mejores personas es una aportaci n fundamental en la construcci n de un mundo m s justo y pac fico
393274 el creyente tiene que ir siempre purificando su fe liber ndola de cosas extra as que la distorsionan y uno de los caminos es someterla a la cr tica de la raz n para no caer en un fide smo ciego que puede llegar a ir contra el bien del hombre
393275 la construcci n de un futuro de paz para el mundo pasa porque las religiones cada una por su camino vayan aceptando e integrando las verdaderas conquistas de la ilustraci n entre ellas los derechos del hombre y especialmente la libertad de la fe y de su ejercicio reconociendo en ellos elementos esenciales tambi n para la autenticidad de la religi n
393276 nuestras sociedades sobre toda en europa aunque en espa a quiz s con algo m s de retraso respecto a otros pa ses est n cambiando mucho con la llegada de personas de otras tradiciones religiosas nos preguntamos c mo integrar a estas personas en nuestra sociedad creo que la soluci n pasa por una convivencia respetuosa en la que se respetan las leyes que esa sociedad se ha dado en raz n de sus tradici n cultural y que sean justas y acordes a los derechos fundamentales del hombre mi opini n personal es que europa no debe permitir que se pongan en cuesti n o no se respeten en su territorio normas b sicas de convivencia que nos hemos dado y que han sido fruto de un largo y laborioso proceso

393289 the bike had been in the same family since the early 1920s with the father of the person i bought it off being a colonel in the british army who kept the bike when he left the forces
393290 it came with letters from previous riders of the machine in the london and brighton areas stating they believed this was the very bike that carried the letter of surrender from the kaiser to the allies in 1918
393291 i was stunned not only had i got the model id been after for some time but id also acquired a bit of world history
393292 brad bringing this very important triumph along is a real coup for the show and i know interest in it will be extremely high

393296 sabar itu ada tiga sabar terhadap musibah sabar terhadap ketaatan dan sabar terhadap maksiat barang siapa bersabar terhadap musibah hingga ia berhasil menolaknya dengan sebaik mungkin maka allah menulis baginya tiga ratus derajat barang siapa bersabar terhadap ketaatan hinghga ia menunaikananya seperti yang diperintahkan oleh allah maka allah menulis untuknya enam ratus derajat dan barang siapa bersabar dari maksiat karena takut terhadap allah dan mengharapkan apa yang disisi nya maka allah menulis baginya sembilan ratus derajat
393297 sabar itu ada dua macam sabar terhadap musibah adalah baik dan sabar yang lebih baik lagi adalah sabar terhadap maksiat
393298 nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam datang ke madinah sedang penduduknya memiliki dua hari raya dimana mereka bersenang senang di dalamnya di masa jahiliyah
393299 maksudnya karena hari idul fitri dan hari raya kurban ditetapkan oleh allah taala merupakan pilihan allah untuk mahluk nya dan karena keduanya mengikuti pelaksanaan dua rukun islam yang agung yaitu haji dan puasa pada dua hari tersebut allah mengampuni orang orang yang melaksanakan ibadah haji dan orang orang yang berpuasa dan dia menebarkan rahmat nya kepada seluruh mahluk nya yang taat adapun hari nairuz dan mahrajan merupakan pilihan para pembesar pada masa itu yang tentunya disesuaikan dengan zaman selera dan semisalnya dari keistimewaan yang akan pudar maka perbedaan keistimewaan dari idul fithri dan idul adha dengan hari nairuz dan mahrajan sangat jelas bagi siapa yang mau memperhatikannya
393300 artinya rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam masuk menemuiku sedangkan di sisiku ada dua anak perempuan kecil yang sedang bernyanyi 2 dengan nyanyian buats lalu beliau berbaring di tempat tidur dan memalingkan wajahnya masuklah abu bakar lalu dia menghardikku dan berkata seruling syaitan di sisi nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam kemudian menghadap ke abu bakar seraya berkata biarkan kedua anak perempuan itu ketika beliau tidur aku memberi isyarat dengan mata kepada dua anak itu maka merekapun keluar
393301 artinya wahai abu bakar setiap kaum memiliki hari raya dan ini adalah hari raya kita

393389 the tough job board market will require additional services like networking
393390 i ask you now please please bring snooks back there has to be a better way for us to solve our differences than this way
393391 i think the average person has access to a very large audience potential that they wouldnt get over broadcast tv airwaves
393392 anyone can post content and potentially reach an audience of a few million its a way to bring attention to your cause
393393 when we created youtube we wanted to create a place where people can connect with others through online video
393394 its inspiring to see that its now being used for such important causes making the most of our community and a truly global reach it offers
393395 the biggest hurdle there ultimately is just because you post something doesnt mean people will care it ultimately relies on the community itself to help virally distribute and draw attention to any specific video

393397 another piece of evidence that the problems the company faces have no short term fixes and we would continue to avoid the shares
393398 few sights have left a deeper impression on me than the charred remains of this genuine texas treasure
393399 i want to know what was working and what wasnt working i can assure you the hard questions are going to be asked
393400 i would certainly hope no one gets away with this
393401 it is an extremely high priority for the department to apprehend this individual
393402 for six years dr ivins fully cooperated with that investigation assisting the government in every way that was asked of him
393403 a world renowned and highly decorated scientist who served his country for over 33 years with the department of the army
393404 we assert his innocence in these killings and would have established that at trial
393405 the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people as has already been seen in this investigation
393406 but if the f b i was really leaning on him what a tremendous load that was on him
393407 the f b i would be remiss not to look at us especially those of us who worked with anthrax
393408 we were all subjected to lie detector tests we were all interviewed
393409 there are very few people who have their feet in both camps
393410 i would urge the bureau to publish its evidence if it declares the case solved and closed
393411 i was scared for my son and for my safety
393412 we would come here every day to pick up our mail after that everything youve done is changed
393413 i think of her often and this is going to bring a lot of it back to me
393414 it has been painful but im hoping this does bring some closure
393415 many of us in here were afraid to come to work for that whole week or two it was a touch and go situation
393416 no person i dont think no one guy was behind the whole thing
393417 its too easy to blame someone whos dead if i were a scientist and had the ability to get poisons at fort detrick i dont think id be using tylenol to kill myself id want to die a lot quicker
393418 we did not know how you could get an infection
393419 she was so clean like a clean freak you had to even take off your shoes to go into her apartment thats why we were shocked when she got the anthrax
393420 every incident has to be seen within its proper framework you study an incident as an incident
393421 an incident is an incident and a crime is a crime
393422 it is as if there is a struggle each against the other and it creates a sectarian atmosphere
393423 this tense atmosphere makes people ready to explode at any point if they are subjected to any amount of instigation or incitement
393424 muslims cant say it but its clear they dont accept us here no one can speak the truth on this issue so everybodys feelings are kept inside
393425 when something happens it always comes back to muslim and christian
393426 if someone cant resolve it they go to the police station
393427 we feel pressure maybe not all the time but we do
393428 we have liberty of speech and religion but its as if somebody was telling us at the same time dont speak and dont practice your religion
393429 me i try to keep a certain distance from muslims
393430 we have simple relations i give you this you give me this thats it they dont want more than that either
393431 only content to send security forces after clashes catch fire
393432 but i would like to let you know that since the lineup of the chinese table tennis team is already finalized and made public it seems that my wish could not be granted
393433 in a joint interview with journalists from 25 news organizations across the world
393434 things are pretty bad and the river is getting deeper faster and wider
393435 the question is can they get to other side before the cash runs out
393436 this is almost like evolution and the survival of the fittest
393437 they are on the right path to make fuel efficient cars but its going to take time
393438 i do see more of a resolve we need to take these actions and focus on what we can control
393439 i said you probably dont want to hear this but your best thing is to keep driving it
393440 its going to cost me more to trade it in than it will to keep driving it
393441 it seems to correlate with the rise in fuel prices
393442 the consumer can expect to pay a higher price today for a compact or subcompact than they would have a few months ago
393443 there is more demand the dealers arent discounting as much if at all
393444 if youre selling an s u v or trading it in youre selling an asset at the low ebb in its value and trying to buy an asset thats been bid up in value
393445 in stock market terms this wouldnt be a propitious time to make that kind of trade
393446 im getting a little tired of that tag around our neck
393447 we are a lot more competitive than people give us credit for we challenge anyone on like items
393448 they dont see those center store categories as being so important
393449 its becoming clear that this worsening economic environment is having an impact on consumers at all economic levels
393450 when you walk into these big beautiful stores its hard for a consumer to think that it is a value oriented type of retailer
393451 theyll say the price is higher but the quality is higher
393452 weve seen evidence of people being more careful with their choices
393453 its a great store but i dont see it as a value
393454 i came for something else one day and was shocked to find the meat on sale so i bought it and put it in the freezer
393455 we are not seeing a catastrophic collapse in the job market like you often see in recessions
393456 what we are seeing instead is a steady hemorrhaging of jobs and that is going to continue until housing stabilizes and stops dragging down the rest of the economy
393457 parents dont push their kids to go to work in good times
393458 but they probably are doing so now with gasoline and food prices squeezing family budgets
393459 if you are the federal reserve this jobs report might even be enough to convince you to cut rates again
393460 when the economy barely grows but labor productivity does you are inevitably putting people out of work
393461 painting helps me to blow off some energy and some anger
393462 if any evidence were to be presented against any individual in pakistan or against the interest of pakistans neighbors then the government would certainly act on that evidence
393463 several outstanding problems in the relationship between the united states and pakistan that the elected government inherited from the past are currently being resolved
393464 these include issues of trust between our two intelligence services
393465 if you ask me to describe the state of the dialogue it is in a place where it hasnt been in the last four years
393466 we face a situation where things have happened in the recent past which were unfortunate and which quite frankly have affected the future of the dialogue
393467 if you have this fluid situation you have elements within the army within the isi who have the opportunity to move forward with their own agenda with respect to afghanistan and india
393468 there is no direction this is what has opened up the door to these elements
393469 in the wake of political gridlock and a lack of a clear political direction some elements of the isi have started to exercise certain prerogatives
393470 in general this administration at its upper reaches has been cool to the elected government from the start
393471 they like to look at musharraf as a factor for stability
393472 its not disarray in the civilian government that has brought a lot of this to light
393473 its the fact that the change of government has brought out to the open a lot that was kept secret before
393474 some people will tell you look at the walls and say they are still pretty high while others will tell you that there is a lot of space between the walls
393475 the police dont check our paperwork anymore and even if they found you without a permit they wont arrest you but rather would suggest you get one as soon as possible
393476 chinas economic development relies on the flow of migrants into cities
393477 you cant tell me that our appeal and calls for revision of the law had no meaning at all
393478 they know that as taxpayers we support the government not the opposite
393479 human rights has become more than just a theory for the public
393480 in the past they petitioned and complained about injustice but that wasnt about defending their rights they let the higher authorities to decide their rights
393481 what they are asking for now is a change in the system and this reflects a widespread change in attitude
393482 i saw a gap between the official story and the reality which was mind blowing like the presence of the armed police
393483 so i put some of these things on the internet on my personal blog
393484 the media has made a huge step forward from the 80s
393485 would have been impossible for the public to know about in the past
393486 today even the farmers in remote areas have satellite tvs
393487 so whenever they see an election such as the one held in pakistan recently they may wonder why even though we have approximately the same economic conditions they can elect their top leaders and we cant even vote for the leader of a small county i think a consciousness of political rights has increased more than anything
393488 there has been progress but its so slow that sometimes one becomes pessimistic
393489 its empty talk to speak of having an independent judiciary if the party leads everything
393490 a september reshuffle is only stage one of an autumn offensive that has to succeed if mr brown is to remain the favourite to lead his party into the next election

393493 signs are emerging of a backlash among mainstream labour mps against david milibands decision to stake his claim to become leader amid fears that his move could hasten a general election before the first signs of an economic recovery
393494 mi5 misled mps about what it knew of the whereabouts of binyam mohamed a british resident who says he was tortured before being secretly rendered to guant namo bay the high court was told yesterday

393496 offenders who plead not guilty after being caught with a knife should expect to go to prison according to a last minute change to judges sentencing guidelines
393497 the government says it will push through measures designed to reduce tory spending in marginal seats despite electoral commission concerns
393498 chaining dogs who are highly social pack animals is dangerous because it deprives them of the social interaction that they need and can make them

393598 he did not seem to have any particular grudges or idiosyncrasies
393599 he was the last person you would have suspected to be involved in something like this
393600 when he feels that he has been slighted and especially towards women he plots and actually tries to carry out revenge killings

393604 all customers will probably be hit in one way or another because bills are going up across the board
393605 the households that are likely to suffer the most are therefore the low income families people that are already struggling to pay their gas and electricity bills
393606 it s important that people realise prices are likely to continue to go up so they should consider getting a capped or fixed deal now
393607 these deals may not always be the cheapest but if you think ahead and think about where prices are going in the future then it may work out cheaper down the line
393608 the appointments of bunmei ibuki as finance minister and kaoru yosano as economy minister gave the impression that fukuda decided to place more emphasis on fiscal rehabilitation and less on economic growth

393610 we will tell citizens that we need to have additional permanent revenue sources over the long term
393611 its necessary to show the public our plan covering a range of two to three years
393612 when it comes to fiscal reform few think that fiscal health will be achieved without raising the consumption tax rate
393613 nakagawa as finance or economy minister could have projected an image that the new fukuda cabinet will remain serious about various reforms
393614 for example he has been consistently calling for further cuts in wasteful government spending before raising consumption taxes
393615 difficult for japan alone to intervene in the foreign exchange markets to curb yen rises given current economic conditions and our currency policy

393617 always encouraged the beijing 2008 organisers to provide media with the fullest access possible to report on the olympic games including access to the internet
393618 over the last year human rights watch has asked the ioc to forcefully intervene with the chinese government to uphold human dignity and fundamental ethics as the olympic charter stipulates
393619 but now we know that not only did the ioc fail to do that it actually helped perpetuate censorship one of the most common abuses in china today
393620 by enabling the chinese governments olympic censorship the ioc is setting a pernicious precedent for future games
393621 the ioc must take immediate steps to make public what beijing promised and to fix this debacle

393680 this decision on kingsnorth is a political tipping point because if we dont say no to unabated coal here how can we say anything to china and india no one will respect the uks opinion
393681 we are saying that network operators cant block people from getting access to any content and any applications
393682 we believe that our network management choices were reasonable wholly consistent with industry practices
393683 we are considering all our legal options and are disappointed that the commission rejected our attempts to settle this issue without further delays

393685 americans download more than 11 billion internet videos per month yet the record contains no evidence that comcast is interfering with sites like youtube

393688 affirmed that iran as a state party to the npt nuclear non proliferation treaty has the right to have its fuel cycle program for peaceful purposes
393689 the ministers are of the view that sanctions imposed on iran for its nuclear program are of political nature and should be promptly removed
393690 they further affirm that with increased cooperation of iran with the agency to resolve all remaining issues about its past and present nuclear activities the issue of iranian nuclear program should be solely dealt with within the agency framework and there is no legal basis that the un security council proceeds in this regard
393691 the un security council has been clear on irans obligations the iaea has been clear that iran has not been transparent
393692 and now they cant even get their friends from the nam to come out in support of their interpretation of their program it actually reinforces just how isolated they are

393694 no progress will be possible without the full cooperation of the sudanese government
393695 the question here is who is the bad actor if the u s wants to keep the pressure on bashir they dont want to suggest that somehow he is being unfairly targeted he is not

393727 the question of power has been settled by the elections
393728 it should be stressed that executive power will remain with the elected president
393729 they had a good meeting they agreed that the war on terror was one that we needed to fight together because the enemy is going not just after pakistanis but the united states as well and so our joint efforts need to be comprehensive
393730 we continue to work with the pakistanis to try to improve the situation
393731 the iraqi government is refusing any individual step to change the situation in kirkuk and it is considering it illegal and unconstitutional
393732 in some places the church is ridiculed as the gay church so membership is lost it is experienced as a new form of colonisation
393733 it is seen as leading to sexual license bishops cannot be a symbol for unity when their consecration divides the church in some regions the issue has become a basis for hostile actions
393734 had no idea their action had caused such a negative impact
393735 the revisionists push upon us the view that current secular culture and not the bible should shape our mission and morals
393736 everywhere we go we meet gay and lesbian activists receive their newsletters or read about their events they seem to be supported by north american churches they are determined that their way is the only right way
393737 we are very proud of his majesty he was under pressure to change and he has
393738 in fact he has done more than we could have hoped for
393739 he should have rollled up his sleeves and laid into the tories instead we got a lecture on oil prices and how difficult everything is
393740 he will get his retaliation in first with a massive relaunch and a massive this or that and everyone will wait and see if it works
393741 it would have been helpful to see some tentative feet being put forward by some non uber blairite wing to say there was some intelligence in the article
393742 he is poised on the edge of a cliff it will only take a small mistake for him to slip and plunge down in the end the public will decide they may just say they do not want brown and if that happens labour backbenchers will follow and if that happens miliband is now clearly there waiting to try and take his chance

393786 el avance de un proceso en condiciones tales que afectar a fatalmente las garant as constitucionales vinculadas con las formas del enjuiciamiento criminal por lo que a mi criterio resultar a tard o atender esos agravios en ocasi n del fallo final de la causa ya que aunque la sentencia fuese absolutoria el perjuicio que el apelante hubiera querido evitar ya se habr a soportado
393787 no concierta con el r gimen imperante el hecho de que un tema en el que se encuentre planteada una cuesti n federal no merezca por limitaciones de fuente local el conocimiento del rgano m ximo de una provincia y s que sea propio de la corte suprema de la naci n

393791 buenos d as endesa si de verdad te preocupas por el futuro de los hijos de tus hijos no destruyas la patagonia
393792 tengo la sensaci n de haber hecho todo lo posible y haberlo hecho bien en el fallo el tribunal le dio validez a la presunci n de inocencia que en los casos mapuches ha sido muy pocas veces respetada y ahora espero que ese fallo sea respetado
393793 no tenemos ninguna confirmaci n oficial sobre la llegada de alg n ministro o si nos van a llamar para entrevistarnos con el gobernador en la capital de la provincia por lo que nosotros nos mantenemos firmes en esa ocupaci n pac fica que es una reivindicaci n territorial
393794 venimos a reivindicar nuestro derecho territorial con un acto de ocupaci n pac fica pero las medidas de acci n directa se ir n incrementando si la provincia no acusa recibo
393795 son candidaturas que han contado con un gran respaldo de firmas patrocinadoras y eso nos tiene contentos en algunos casos la ley nos exig a reunir 70 firmas y se juntaron m s de 100 eso habla de un respaldo creciente
393796 penchuleo representa para nosotros un nuevo tipo de liderazgo es un joven mapuche de la zona que ha destacado como dirigente universitario y cuya elecci n como candidato fue producto de un proceso de primarias in dito entre las comunidades de la zona
393797 podemos hacer historia en lautaro existen all cerca de 300 comunidades y los avances que hemos logrado como partido nos tienen optimistas sabemos que tenemos que trabajar duro y el mandato que la gente a entregado a luis es competir para ganar
393798 el pe i mario es un lider tradicional respetado y querido por las comunidades en la zona de freire su trayectoria habla por l y estamos orgullosos de que nos represente en la contienda electoral de octubre
393799 ambas candidaturas se han formalizado bajo la modalidad de independientes y eso nos exige trabajar el doble
393800 lamentablemente el servel aun no nos autoriza iniciar la campa a de firmas para legalizarnos y esto nos ha perjudicado sin embargo estas municipales nos dar n la oportunidad de seguir socializando nuestra propuesta pol tica a nivel de base y preparando el terreno para cuando demos el vamos a la campa a que esperamos sea el segundo semestre
393801 lautaro y freire son comunas de alta poblaci n mapuche y donde est n las bases fundadoras del partido lo que esperamos con estas candidaturas es acrecentar adem s nuestra base de militantes y posicionar a wallmapuwen de cara a nuestra campa a de legalizaci n ambas comunas son emblem ticas para nosotros y esperamos que al igual como sucede hoy con luis penchuleo en lautaro sigan surgiendo desde las comunidades liderazgos j venes que refresquen la pol tica mapuche y constituyan un real aporte a nuestro pueblo

393813 the smoking ban was not a mistake in restaurants and most public places but it was a mistake in bars publicans should have been free to make the choice just as we do in our own houses and patrons could have chosen whether to visit smoking or non smoking places
393814 a barrel of s because your rotton stinking habit actually interferes with my enjoyment and good feeling when out for a night i have had to suffer the rotton stinking smell that you and millions of other smokers have willing forced other people to suffer for years you are the one who does not get it
393815 we believe that 37 people a year die in britain from passive smoking
393816 filled with quiz machines karaoke stages and drunken teenagers shouting at each other
393817 it cannot be due to the smoking ban if less than half of the population are smokers then by definition more than half agree that the ban is good
393818 busy destroying the very pub culture upon which their livelihoods depend
393819 but you already have 4 televisions on the other walls blasting out eastenders and the like
393820 whatever thats called it isnt a community if you want your european caf culture you dont just get it by throwing up a few neon signs saying open all hours
393821 surely with what we know about the effects of second hand smoke
393822 the decline in pubs is to do with three things the smoking ban a fraying in the old notion of community and as a result of happy hours and drinks promotions
393823 the decline in pubs is to do with the smoking ban
393824 please dont tell me id be better off staying here in australia
393825 a ban on smoking allows groups that contain both smokers and non smokers to socialise more easily in a non smoking environment it is easy for the smoker to pop outside for five minutes
393826 publicans should have been free to make the choice just as we do in our own houses and patrons could have chosen whether to visit smoking or non smoking places
393827 were a trading nation as you know we depend on the ability of our exporters to access markets worldwide and in particular markets in emerging or developing economies
393828 theres no doubt that this is a significant setback especially for our farmers and exporters given the economic benefits that they and canada as a whole stood to achieve from a positive outcome
393829 these talks may have stalled at this time but we remain committed to more liberalized trade a rules based system and the overall objectives of the doha negotiations
393830 the developed countries on the one side like canada the u s and europe have come to an agreement to accept these special safeguards but the threshold or the trigger levels need to be a little less protective than what the developing countries are looking for
393831 theres been in our view significant progress achieved between hong kong two years ago and these meetings this past week far too much progress to let it be dropped let it be put on the shelf for an extended period
393832 the challenge is theres a number of extenuating circumstances around that including the u s presidential election
393833 its going to be very very difficult to get them up and running again before this fall
393834 i think the most significant thing we can do in the interim is begin a very aggressive program of bilaterals
393835 we have a lot of room and a lot of opportunity to make bilateral agreements that can be beneficial to canadian agriculture
393836 i think what you will see is whilst many countries will express what were expressing today that hopefully the talks can be revived sooner than later there will be many of us that will seriously engage toward bilaterals
393837 we will push ahead with our trade agenda and our efforts to find more opportunities for our producers and exporters these talks may have stalled at this time but we remain committed to more liberalized trade a rules based system and the overall objectives of the doha negotiations in the meantime were going to be knocking on doors around the world to create new opportunities for our farmers and our exporters
393838 weve fallen behind united states and weve also fallen behind other pork exporting countries such as chile
393839 i dont think theyve measured up in regards to getting other bilateral agreements signed as some of the other countries have a number of the other countries have gone ahead and signed bilateral agreements not waiting for wto to be the answer to all of their problems so i think canada is maybe lagging a little behind

393966 we had been tracking the same beast but we were far from hunting together when we each realized the other was after the same target we began to hamper each others attempts to track it we would disarm each others traps fire our weapons while the other was stalking to scare the beast away we did all sorts of underhanded things to ensure that the other hunter did not catch the beast first
393967 it wasnt until your grandfather came to my camp and proposed that we both hunt the beast together that our rivalry ended
393968 i was wary of his intentions that day but i ultimately decided to go along anyway when we finally tracked the beast down again big xindi then offered to let me kill it if i would aid him in finding another for himself

393976 masih sangat jauh kalau dikatakan pak akbar dan ratna sarumpaet sudah menyatakan resmi mendaftar ke pbr sebagai salah satu peserta konvensi namun kalau ada pembicaraan secara pribadi dengan ketua umum kami bursah zarnubi saya juga tidak tahu kalau resmi yang jelas belum
393977 sekarang ini kami memang membuka pintu selebar lebarnya kepada seluruh anak bangsa tua maupun yang muda bila merasa punya kemampuan memimpin bangsa ini pak akbar ratna sarumpaet atau siapapun bila memang merasa pbr sebagai wadah yang dianggap mampu mengantarkan sebagai calon pemimpin mengapa tidak kami sedang mempersiapkan mekanismenya agar konvensi yang kita lakukan ini bisa berjalan dengan baik

394008 it appears to me that this incident was fuelled by drink however this is no excuse for the damage they have done the actions of this minority must be condemned it is bad enough that these young men were subjected to verbal abuse but more worryingly they could have sustained injury from the missiles which were then thrown at them

394031 this issue about water metering and the differences in totals across premises was raised with me by disgruntled business owners from across the constituency in some cases business people who have more than one store found that different premises were been charged ranging values for their water despite using similar amounts in some cases the differences in the total charged amounted to over 500 whereby those being charged on capital value were in excess of 700 and those metered were less than 200
394032 with the impending introduction of water charges confidence in the ability of northern ireland water to run things efficiently and effectively is vital if the public are going to be expected to trust those in charge discrepancies such as this do nothing to help ease fears and only serve to heighten tension
394033 it was bad enough to be told that bills could vary by tremendous amounts but to also learn that some premises which do not even use water are been billed really means that questions have to be asked the business owners affected have a right to know how this situation was allowed to develop and what measures are going to be taken to address it with immediate effect
394034 diane abbotts amendment to the hfea bill is disappointing but unsurprising successive westminster administrations including the present government have given assurances that northern irelands abortion law will not be overturned without the consent of the people of northern ireland this established policy respects the integrity of the devolved institutions and the consistently expressed opinion of the northern ireland assembly that the 1967 act should not be extended to this part of the united kingdom
394035 the political earthquake of the glasgow east by election result cannot be underestimated the last time a non labour mp represented this part of glasgow was 1918 nearly a century a go labour is losing its heartlands a stunning indictment of how out of touch this government is with the country it is clear that a new political landscape is emerging in the united kingdom however part of that landscape is also the worrying advance of scottish nationalism

394037 the uups support for the best of education system will continue as will our opposition to the failed comprehensive experiment unlike the dup we are not the party proposing to radically reduce grammar school places in northern ireland that said parents and teachers across northern ireland will be wondering why exactly alistair ross and the dup have decided to attack the uup while catronia ruanes assault on our schools continues
394038 do i understand what is being advertised to me or is this advertisement filled with jargon and technical lingo i cant grasp
394039 we in northern ireland are very fortunate that local is a word that can be attributed to our entire country given the fact that it approximately one hundred miles long in any direction and given that fact the vast majority of foods advertised in market places here are locally produced consumers know they are buying quality
394040 however the problems start when traders are selling products under the guise of been locally produced when in reality they are not in truth a consumer could just go to the supermarket and buy the same product often for cheaper and so to have traders using the word local to promote something which clearly isnt can taint farmers trading in the same area that is the last thing we want to see happen as it has the potential to put people off from coming along to markets to buy produce
394041 this may not be a huge problem in northern ireland and we should be thankful for that however any issue that could reflect badly upon the local farming community such as false advertising at local markets needs to be raised so that people are aware

394118 customs agents must have the ability to conduct even highly intrusive searches when there is reason to suspect criminal or terrorist activity but suspicionless searches of americans laptops and similar devices go too far congress should not allow this gross violation of privacy

394195 the scientific community is really going to run with this
394196 the success of biomedexperts com is a testament to the role innovative technology can play in enabling researchers to collaborate and drive meaningful scientific discoveries

394212 there were two waves at the end of that heat and he went on the first one and i took the second and it turned out to be a really good wave
394213 when i came out of the barrel and into the channel everyone was screaming this is the biggest win of my career i have won a few asp wqs events but to beat slater here in these conditions is amazing
394214 when i came up through the cave it felt like i won the event
394215 there were so many people screaming and cheering it felt really good i guess its a big deal that no one else had beat him this year but ive been training hard and i hope to be going much further in this event
394216 i knew i shouldnt have gone on that first wave
394217 congratulations to tiago pires as he surfed really well hes definitely not one who i underestimate and he is probably one of the best barrel riders in the world it was one of those situations that i played through in my head about a minute before it actually happened but that happens from time to time before the contest started i said my luck would have to run out somewhere and i guess it was here
394218 its an unfortunate result here no one likes a 17th
394219 however we get two throwaways and when i do that im still counting four wins this year which is pretty good lowers has always been a good venue for me it feels like my backyard and it is typically one where i do really well you can never discount any one in any heat though these are the best surfers in the world and theyre all dangerous
394220 our heat was so slow for waves it was unbelievable
394221 i was in the water at the end of slater and tiagos heat and when tiago pires came out of the barrel the entire cliff erupted and i thought wow that sure isnt for us because nothing has happened yet fortunately a few rolled through and i was in position to capitalize im happy to be moving through to round 4
394222 tiago pires has been putting in a lot of great performances all year long and it was only a matter of time before he took down a big name
394223 i think what its done is really fired everyone up especially the top seeds since it offers us a chance to gain some ground on kelly slater
394224 some heats will have really good waves while others have a bit of a struggle thankfully for us the waves really turned on there and i was able to grab a couple of good ones
394225 damien hobgood and i are really good friends and weve been surfing out here a lot the past few days
394226 we knew we were seeded pretty close for this round and we were watching all day yesterday to see what would happen seeing who could lose or win so that we didnt end up with each other thats how it goes sometimes and i was able to get a couple of really good ones towards the start and managed to get through
394227 ive had a pretty shocking year so far and i havent managed better than 9th
394228 im fired up to be here though and into round 4 and im ready to break through with a result
394229 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law

394231 saddam has been hanged karadzic was recently arrested but this man goes around the world lecturing on the rule of law
394232 i am disgusted that tony blair has been invited to malaysia this man to me is a war criminal through instigating the war in iraq he has killed more than radovan karadzic and saddam hussein
394233 it is disgusting to see this criminal of the highest order being welcomed in malaysia and worse still to talk on the rule of law when he broke all international laws and the laws of his own country by deliberately lying and sending young british soldiers to die in a war of aggression
394234 yet you have seen how readily the united states and its cohorts condemn the president of sudan omar bashir for alleged war crimes in darfur when there is no evidence that he deliberately issued orders to war against anyone
394235 the conspiracy of silence by malaysias media is to be condemned for you are lending support to a war criminal whose criminal acts must not go unpunished

394252 with all due respect to the other sides in connacht beating galway is a big thing
394253 we went into that game fully confident in our ability and that came from winning the province we were playing brilliant football at the time and recovered well when tyrone got the goal in the second half
394254 we gave him the ball at every opportunity and it forced dooher to defend while did an excellent job on cavanagh too both sides have probably slipped back a little since then tyrone have had their injury problems to their big men too
394255 its understandable that the confidence ebbs away after a defeat in the province mayo and galway know that when they beat each other they have something to point to for the year
394256 although the last day was a little different its generally felt down here in mayo that we finished with a better team than we started with after the sligo game there was probably a little confusion as to what our best team was and we only found that out after maybe 20 minutes from there we played some really good stuff

394320 within 24 to 48 hours owners usually begin to notice that their horse is painful and wont eat
394321 the horse may also have increased salivation a swollen tongue or cheeks and bad breath
394322 a lot of owners think the problem is caused from an insect bite or sting but it is more likely from a foreign body that got lodged in the mouth
394323 if the problem was caused by an insect such as a bee fly or spider like a black widow or brown recluse the swelling should decrease with time the same is true of mild lacerations if a foreign body is the culprit the swelling will remain or even get worse after two or three days until it is removed the problem will not go away
394324 mechanical irritation and sores from grass awns are completely preventable

394327 when you have a horse with a swollen mouth or tongue you must be very careful when administering anti inflammatories or some antibiotics if the horse is not drinking

394329 many objects like wood are hard to diagnose and find but metallic objects are easier because they show up more clearly on a radiograph or x ray
394330 sometimes a bad tooth can cause similar symptoms especially if material is not found in the tongue
394331 if the material is not found during the oral examination radiographs or ultrasound imaging are used in attempt to diagnose the problem
394332 after we remove the object the horse is put on antibiotics for three to five days because most of the time an abscess forms around the foreign body
394333 the abscess usually drains when the object is taken out and we dont suture the incision closed because we want to let it continually drain and heal from the inside out

394550 im concerned about the churchs obsession im not convinced this is biblical interpretation or the authority of scripture both regarding women and homosexuals we find it difficult to say what we believe we wrap it up in theological clothing and thats how we give it credence if homosexuality is such a terrible sin why was it not given any time in jesuss ministry after all he spoke about adultery and the need to love widows orphans and the vulnerable
394551 i acquired the triumph back in 1997 for 4 000 with the intention of using it on special occasions
394552 it didnt need any work doing to it at all really which was my main reason for wanting it
394553 the bike had been in the same family since the early 1920s with the father of the person i bought it off being a colonel in the british army who kept the bike when he left the forces
394554 it came with letters from previous riders of the machine in the london and brighton areas stating they believed this was the very bike that carried the letter of surrender from the kaiser to the allies in 1918
394555 i was stunned not only had i got the model id been after for some time but id also acquired a bit of world history
394556 brad bringing this very important triumph along is a real coup for the show and i know interest in it will be extremely high

394562 we have had such a growth of interest that we have had to extend the sale to two days and two venues to allow us to exhibit the works as they deserve we are seeing a maturing market for south african art with a greater appreciation by non south african buyers increasingly the market is demanding the best but also paying greater and greater record prices artists like maggie laubscher irma stern and pierneef are receiving prices and critical recognition which would have delighted them had they lived to see it the 450 lots in this sale is a fantastic cross section of some of the very best south african work ever seen anywhere in the world

394616 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
394617 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
394618 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed

394625 terrorism continues to rear its ugly head in our region it remains the single biggest threat to our stability
394626 we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric

394629 we must defend the value of pluralism peaceful existence and the rule of law
394630 we have only to see the rapid integration within asean and its emergence as an important economic bloc in asia to understand the opportunities that beckon

394636 we will go ahead with these initiatives at a pace we are all comfortable with

394646 jokes have varied over the years with some taking the question and answer format while others are witty proverbs or riddles

394649 the incident that happened to our athletes is unprecedented i just dont remember anything like it
394650 we dont really want to create a scandal convinced that something is one way and then get proof that directly contradicts it we especially dont want to do this directly in beijing
394651 when one week ahead of the games they take out a whole row of likely medallists its simply not something you can call accidental
394652 but its hardly worth jumping to conclusions without carefully getting into the nuances of the issue or calling it political
394653 if the athletes are guilty they will be punished if we see that the international sporting organisations have not followed the letter of the law then we will be discussing this differently perhaps in court or other means of defence

394655 a judge should not consider his or her personal preference as to outcome any more than an umpire should call balls and strikes based on which team is his or her favorite

394663 mr george feels overwhelmed by the verdict as throughout the trial he did not dare to get his hopes up and he continually said to me in the dock he believed he would be convicted
394664 his eyes filled with tears and he took a very deep breath
394665 mr george now has the right to be regarded as an innocent man but that does not mean it was wrong to bring the case
394666 que son grav simamente injustas y deben ser cambiadas por lesionar derechos fundamentales
394667 were a bit threadbare right now the players i have here are all ive got
394668 bobo balde is here and is looking to move on and we have two young kids we really need to get players back fit
394669 they have luka modric david bentley dimitar berbatov then the left back gareth bale comes on and hes worth 12m
394670 its easy for them to progress when they have money to spend we dont have that money and we have to do our best with what weve got and make players better
394671 what are our limits do you get half a bentley a quarter of bentley do we get bentleys right leg
394672 if you said to juande ramos to get rid of all his top players and give him x amount and say get to the champions league last eight he would just laugh at you
394673 we know that its nothing new and were not complaining
394674 you bent over in the middle of the road today to take a photograph and a pickup almost side swiped your butt

394677 if we can do one more signing we will do it
394678 we dont need money before we can buy but it has to be the right person that is very difficult at the moment
394679 if we can get a midfielder who can play a tactical role we will do it we need one more body in there
394680 the 100 million euros offered by real is astonishing but not everything can be bought
394681 i think its right that a player is not authorised to have the last word always
394682 ferguson is stubborn i think ronaldo will stay at manchester its the right decision from a technical point of view
394683 however portugals result at the european championships shows that not even ronaldo can win a big tournament on his own
394684 its beautiful to see him run after his defender until the corner flag hes the prototype of the modern champion
394685 we would like to see the greatest degree of openness
394686 there has been no change in the iocs position the ioc would like to see open access
394687 when there were problems on wednesday the iocs team met with the organising committee and asked if they could be resolved
394688 we can only encourage moving towards that openness and transparency
394689 based upon information obtained as recently as today august 1 she accepts the fact that the testing was properly done and the results properly reported
394690 she sadly accepts the fact that this necessarily means she will not be able to compete in the upcoming olympics in beijing and faces a possible two year suspension of eligibility
394691 jessica is heartbroken at this turn of events as making the u s olympic team was her cherished dream and proudest moment she intends to resume her swimming career as soon as possible and to again fulfill her olympic dream in 2012
394692 rebecca soni will swim the 100m breaststroke and kara lynn joyce will swim the 50m freestyle
394693 we are going to seek to have her suspension reduced and rsserve the right to bring that issue to arbitration

394709 wie de onaanvaardbare keuze maakt om vals te spelen moet gestraft worden
394710 als standard een zware tegenstander lootte dan mocht fellaini terugkeren naar belgi
394711 of standard eigenlijk wel een zwakke ploeg kon loten als niet reekshoofd was dat inderdaad moeilijk maar liverpool is een europese topper
394712 het was lastig om in deze zaak een goeie beslissing te nemen ik heb getracht om standard n de bondscoach tevreden te stellen dit lijkt mij toch een eerbaar compromis

394741 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
394742 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
394743 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
394744 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
394745 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
394746 ive used linux for several years and have been a particular fan of debian and firefox for a long time

394748 then in 2002 microsofts web site featured a testimonial called
394749 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
394750 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
394751 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
394752 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
394753 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
394754 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
394755 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
394756 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
394757 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
394758 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
394759 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
394760 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
394761 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
394762 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
394763 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
394764 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
394765 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
394766 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
394767 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
394768 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
394769 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
394770 who are open to doing something on the production side
394771 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
394772 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
394773 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
394774 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
394775 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
394776 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
394777 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
394778 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
394779 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
394780 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
394781 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
394782 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
394783 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
394784 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
394785 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
394786 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
394787 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
394788 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
394789 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
394790 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
394791 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
394792 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
394793 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
394794 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
394795 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
394796 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
394797 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
394798 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
394799 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
394800 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
394801 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
394802 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
394803 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
394804 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
394805 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
394806 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
394807 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
394808 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
394809 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
394810 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
394811 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
394812 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
394813 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
394814 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
394815 while 250m sh410b has been invested in the sector in the last 10 years by the end of this financial year investments in this sector will have exceeded 500m
394816 oil had been discovered in six places in hoima mputa waraga kingfisher taitai ngege and karuka and one gas discovery has been made at nzizi
394817 a new oil and gas policy has therefore been formulated through an extensive consultative process
394818 the consultative process involved local government civil societies community and cultural leaders in the albertine graben
394819 the policys goal is to use the oil and gas to eradicate poverty and create a lasting value to society
394820 if better material was used it would at least not have turned into rubble like this
394821 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
394822 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
394823 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
394824 skyrocketing gas prices is the most important issue on the minds of my constituents in georgia and all over the country
394825 there are several issues that need to be addressed with respect to the issue of skyrocketing gas prices
394826 supply and demand dictates the price of everything in our economy weve got to have the capability of providing the kind of supply that is demanded by americans
394827 weve got to continue down the road of researching and developing more alternative fuels
394828 weve also got to implement conservation practices from an individual and household standpoint
394829 another common sense solution republicans have offered and ive supported is an immediate federal gas tax holiday
394830 if we can do something about the pain at the pump the obvious question is why arent we
394831 it is not by our own power that we treat you but by the power of christ the true god believe in him and be healed
394832 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
394833 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
394834 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
394835 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
394836 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
394837 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

394845 has agreed an improved four year deal with arsenal that will tie him to the club until 2012
394846 fate was what mcclaren called it in public though he may have employed a different f word as he watched the draw unfold in private
394847 mcclaren has a very poor record against arsene wenger as a manager
394848 10 teenagers with the talent to impress in the premier league
394849 it emerged he has agreed an improved four year deal with arsenal that will tie him to the club until 2012
394850 he will sign a new contract to stay at the emirates stadium until 2013 adebayor has been tracked by ac milan barcelona and real madrid this summer but decided to stay in london after arsenal agreed to increase his wages to about 70 000 a week wenger confirmed yesterday that william gallas would continue as club captain this season
394851 fate was what mcclaren called it in public though he may have employed a different f word as he watched the draw unfold in private
394852 defeated lampooned and finally forced to find employment overseas steve mcclaren probably felt that his luck could not get any worse but that was before the new fc twente manager found himself drawn against arsenal in the champions league qualifiers when he takes a few moments to reflect on the cruelty of a champions league draw that has paired him with one of the best teams in europe mcclaren may not see it as quite so unlucky for the first time in a long time he has nothing to lose defeat for fc twente is expected the pressure would have been much greater had he lost to one of the qualifying rounds unknowns after the club finished in fourth place in the eredivisie last season and won a play off to get into the champions league qualifiers
394853 mcclaren has a very poor record against arsene wenger as a manager while in charge of middlesbrough he lost nine of ten matches played against arsenal most embarrasing were a 4 0 defeat at the riverside in his first match at the club in 2001 and a 7 0 hammering at highbury five years later mclaren did engineer a two legged semi final victory over arsenal in the carling cup four years ago but they fielded a weakened team

394857 in the last 20 years english football has produced two genuinely world class talents one was paul gascoigne the other is wayne rooney one was doomed by his nature and the company it attracted the other is it is surely about time to say in danger of falling a long way short of his promise we all know how it ended for gazza and how severe was the onslaught of the demons that still plague him rooney it is reasonable to believe has no such threat to his future as an exceptional player yet he remains a luminary in default a still largely undelivered gift to the national game
394858 shevchenkos traumatic two year stay at chelsea reached its nadir last night when he missed a penalty that condemned his side to another defeat in the russian capital after hearing his manager luiz felipe scolari indicate that he has little future at the club the ukraine striker had already endured a miserable day with carlo ancelotti ruling out his return to ac milan and claiming that the player has psychological problems before his humiliation at the penalty spot
394859 you have to be a special person and a special player to earn a three year contract at the age of 37 friedels new deal is a triumph for all his hard work consistency and sheer professionalism by considerable contrast mark bosnich played his first competitive match for four years this last weekend turning out for the australian club in a bid to resurrect a career tainted and utterly disrupted by a drugs scandal back in 2002 whilst he was at chelsea by coincidence bosnich is 36 just 12 months younger than friedel alas he has never matched the solid professionalism of the american goalkeeper wasting important years in the fall out from his drugs escapade

394865 can you imagine the likes of barletta or celano facing juventus or inter in the knock out stages of the coppa italia finally starting from next season small teams coming from serie d or the new lega pro formerly c1 and c2 will be able to meet the giants of italian football in the national cup this is because of the new formula adopted by the lega calcio which we could describe as the italian version of the english fa cup being one of the most conservative organisations in the game the lega felt a radical change in national competition was needed

394881 kilmainham jail is now a fabulous museum which is a must see on every tourists itinerary considering the courthouses association with such historical and political figures as the invincibles the fenians and the 1916 volunteers it would be an appropriate project to have it restored and incorporated into the museum complex for the 1916 centenary commemoration in 2016

394889 the color of a mans skin has no bearing on his ability to lead and the only one who is bringing it race up is obama himself if his positions on issues are so radically far from what americans believe that he is uncomfortable defending them in the public arena then it is no wonder obama wishes to stifle free speech with the fairness doctrine and silence his opponents by playing the race card americans need to turn up the heat on this messiah of the radical left and see what he is made of
394890 in response to campaign attacks about his record on the energy crisis and his ability to lead
394891 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
394892 so now all of us who might have legitimate critiques about his record his stance on issues his avoidance of confirming where he was born his position on killing babies that survived abortions his false christianity his islamic world view toward jesus christ his connections to former terrorists his support from islamic terrorists his desire to stop free speech in america his refusal to allow offshore drilling to lower gas prices his tax on americans for global poverty we cant say anything about these things why because if we do we are racists

394929 implements a new holiday to accommodate the muslim workers at the plant
394930 the five year contract creates an additional paid holiday iidal fitil a muslim holiday that occurs toward the end of ramadan
394931 the new contract includes eight paid holidays which is the same number provided in the old contract
394932 however the union leadership did request and receive eid al fitr which is apparently spelled various ways including id al fitr and eid ul fitr as a paid holiday in place of labor day
394933 since all team members will still have eight paid holidays the change will not affect production
394934 is distinguished by the performance of communal prayer salat at daybreak on its first day it is a time of official receptions and private visits when friends greet one another presents are given new clothes are worn and the graves of relatives are visited
394935 eid al fitr is one of eight paid holidays for all team members covered by the contract while labor day is not a paid holiday
394936 based on the contract the other paid holidays include the team members birthday new years day martin luther king jr day memorial day independence day thanksgiving day and christmas day
394937 implementing this holiday was a challenge since it falls on a different day every year and is declared on fairly short notice
394938 but the negotiating committee felt this was extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians

394947 a criminal prosecution is a very serious matter especially to a good young man
394948 a minimum of investigation or thought would have shown that the police had identified the wrong

394999 our results show that at least for urinary tract infections cranberry juice targets the right bacteria those that cause disease but has no effect on non pathogenic organisms suggesting that cranberry juice will not disrupt bacteria that are part of the normal flora in the gut
395000 we have also shown that this effect occurs at concentrations of cranberry juice that are comparable to levels we would expect to find in the urinary tract
395001 this suggests that to realize the antibacterial benefits of cranberry one must consume cranberry juice regularly perhaps daily

395050 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
395051 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent
395052 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk
395053 this is something the military understands but the british public does not

395246 bipv makes a building highly energy efficient and reduces carbon emissions while ensuring basic functions of standard building elements such as water tightness light transmittance and thermal insulation
395247 the cost of an installed bipv system can vary from 12 20 per watt peak or even higher depending upon the complexities of installation or type of solar modules the payback will significantly depend upon the local utilitys willingness to buy the green energy at a preferential feed in tariff the rate at which the power utility buys the power from the producer this is what drives the urban pv market the world over and we envisage that it is going to happen in india as well in the years ahead
395248 we were given an estimate that we were paying about rs 6 lakh more for all the bipv paraphernalia which was okay because we would be paying far less for our electricity and recovering the cost in a few years
395249 there is a benefit of rs 7 per kilowatt hour to the residents
395250 we must realise that switching to solar is not just about payback it is also about taking that all important first step towards securing your own energy source and about making a green choice

395282 mankad was a gifted batsman an outstanding captain and a respected cricket guru an individual who dedicated his life to the sport he will be missed by every single follower of cricket in this country
395283 he had a great cricketing brain and was regarded by one and all as a great tactician his contribution and records in domestic cricket are unmatched

395286 as we meet today most countries of our region are faced with the curse of terrorism that threatens the peace and stability that is needed so much for the forward march of our people
395287 we need to redouble our efforts for collective action to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations it is imperative to remember the element of interdependence which is crucial for durable peace and the protection of democratic values
395288 we must ensure strengthening regional legal mechanism and intensifying intelligence sharing in order to secure the regions collective prosperity peace and stability
395289 in my view it is also necessary that we as a region endeavour to set right the many wrong impressions that exist or are promoted elsewhere about the actions that are imperative to protect our people and societies from the brutalities of terrorism

395490 what it turned out to be was a hydraulic leak of hydraulic fluid coming out of the hydraulic system creating a fine spray at the back of the aircraft that looked like smoke
395491 if hes ever going to get tossed its going to be now
395492 had hillman laid back and dismissed it as an early mistake in spring training how could he command his players attention in august
395493 if you get somebody who comes to be 10 games better than last year ill show you somebody whos not very passionate about what theyre doing
395494 but theres no guarantee they would have done that for the rangers
395495 you are not cutting my hair stitch it up the way it is dirt road bits and hair it will be okay
395496 nurse can i have a shot of sodium pentathol for her

395500 miley cyrus is now the richest child in the world
395501 were talking about an artist made of nothing but quality
395502 we were pretty blown away by the demand that took place our first year
395503 we had to basically close the order process down on the website because we had such high demand we wanted to make sure we could serve our customers the best we could our very first year
395504 probably the most advantageous aspect of being a student entrepreneur has been being here among our own customers
395505 we get a lot of support from the university which is very helpful
395506 youll see us next year in a lot of new places across the country
395507 there was something special about the immersive style of teaching that takes place in latin america
395508 i saw how much everyone enjoyed learning and how fast they learned spanish
395509 it was what i wanted to do and i had a lot of passion for it so i made the time and made it a priority
395510 learning a language is more than just learning words or grammar its actually learning the culture
395511 through mi maestro youre able to make a real connection between the two
395512 culturally speaking our humor is very on point with our age demographic which is 18 to 28
395513 despite being owned by this big company weve really retained our personality in a big way
395514 this company has always been run by and for 20 year olds and to change that would be a mistake
395515 its the opposite of what we see when looking at use of social networking sites for business purposes among adults where men are far more likely to use sites such as linkedin among this younger demographic its the women who are the ber networkers
395516 weve seen older adult women tend to be more careful with networking and sharing information obviously thats not the case for younger women
395517 as these women age i think the disparity will go away the question is what kind of choices will be available for them
395518 they have huge impact on what their parents buy and then they have their own money more than any other generation before them and of course they are the consumers of tomorrow
395519 in america everyone wants to be younger so we look to younger people we think theyre happier than us and we want to be like them resulting in a younger targeted marketing message
395520 nice to meet you i hope we can do something together i loved your breitling watch i have two tickets to the stanley cup finals if you want to attend
395521 many of our kids dont speak english everybody knows its important to speak english except for some young people you see hanging around on the corners
395522 i felt like ebay had grown to the point where its this faceless corporation and i wanted to create a company that would have a handmade feel to it
395523 we have a really good advisory team but i also want to keep that experimentation and i dont want to feel like i have a formula for how things work
395524 i wanted the company itself to be a community based on how much we see each other but also because we do have this common purpose
395525 two nights ago at 11 p m there were 10 people sitting around cutting patterns learning how to make their own skirts and shirts
395526 an item has this whole other layer of meaning to it if you know who gave it to you who made it or if you made it
395527 when it breaks or needs alteration you can fix it or you know somebody who can fix it instead of living in this utterly throwaway culture where if something doesnt work or doesnt fit you just get rid of it
395528 i think theres still 99 percent of the world who doesnt know who the hell we are
395529 youd have to be blind not to see what is the economic strength of the franchise
395530 the goal is to take as much subjectivity out of it as possible
395531 you read a car review all youre reading is some guys opinion what were doing is taking all the credible information that we think is out there the end result certainly smoothes out a lot of the opinions
395532 an excellent way to draw some advertisers into the franchise that normally would not be there
395533 but its what everybody has to do now to survive
395534 its a good thing for the magazine because the guy just sees the world better than other people do
395535 we used to get 500 pages a year of ads out of detroit and now were down below 50
395536 so it will be tougher to establish the kind of authority
395537 they probably should have done something like this a lot sooner
395538 id be very bored without it ive always dreamt big but never thought it could be like this
395539 not a day goes by that i dont get stopped on the street or receive an e mail from someone telling me i made a difference in their life
395540 the business has been a giant success and were still young
395541 even if everyone is against you if you are passionate about something you have to fight for it
395542 were doing a lot weve leveraged our brand in different marketplaces which has allowed us to grow with the help of other peoples expertise
395543 on the surface it seemed like the quintessential poster child for a bad dotcom idea
395544 back in 2003 we thought of ourselves as a shoe company that offered great service today we really think of the zappos brand as about great service and we just happen to sell shoes
395545 its not as if my baby grew up and went to college its as if my baby was picked up by an alien space craft and beamed to another planet
395546 dont take anything for granted enjoy the moment recognize the beauty and good fortune and take pictures
395547 advertisers are increasingly looking for more targeted audiences and better reach sites where they can find candidates that are more qualified
395548 those have been successful partnerships for newspapers by giving them access to both a national audience as well as leveraging their own local sales and local audience
395549 when we are looking for somebody to put a post up there you get a fair amount of response but not the quality
395550 obviously when you are going to a site that has a much larger user base you can get more applicants you have more to choose from
395551 to ensure we always have the best talent in every region across the county monster has relationships with several niche sites that target specific demographics we also have added visibility in the regions touched by the local media outlets we have forged relationships with
395552 this is enabling advertisers to go more into the niches these people are out there on the web in all sorts of places
395553 we can reach out to them there with display advertising
395554 the larger boards need to be careful because to some extent they could cannibalize themselves by investing in or working with the emerging sites
395555 everything is on the table now well see how it plays out
395556 the players came out and played with a lot of poise especially when we were up by 14 points and then adamson made a really really big run
395557 this time there will be no us observers i dont know the reason
395558 of course we will provide them with security im not just sure if their escorts will be coming from manila or there in mindanao
395559 there will always be situations of material need where help in the form of concrete love for neighbour is indispensable
395560 what is this perhaps they did and this is the improvement on the first draft but i somehow find that very hard to believe
395561 kalau irr tidak berbeda jauh dengan bank kenapa harus repot repot ditempatkan di jalan tol sebaiknya masukan saja ke bank tidak usah repot repot hasilnya sama
395562 kalau perhitungannya benar dan ternyata lebih maka itu menjadi keuntungannya tetapi sebaliknya jika ternyata tidak sesuai harapan seperti terjadi di tangerang merak itu menjadi resiko investor disini ada faktor resiko investasi
395563 jadi besaran tarif yang ideal sehingga dapat diterima investor asing rp750 per kilometer bukan rp600 per kilometer
395564 a ll religions are true all religions have some error in them
395565 but i say to you that everyone who looks lustfully at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart
395566 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
395567 there are also positive social and psychological aspects to the game that can be of help
395568 a vast multitude were convicted not so much of the crime of incendiarism as of hatred of the human race
395569 its interesting how people can take time to do all this
395570 my favorite cars are the ones with the replica trunks rolling behind them

395574 ekspansi industri tambak udang secara global itu telah berakibat memperluas pengrusakan ekosistem pantai secara keseluruhan
395575 kami juga minta para pengusaha ikut bertanggungjawab untuk membatasi konsumsi udang hasil budidaya intensif itu sejalan dengan usaha mereka yang gencar dalam memasarkan dan mempromosikan produk udangnya
395576 kami juga menolak berbagai skema sertifikasi dan label udang yang dibuat untuk dapat dipasarkan di dunia seperti udang organik maupun udang beretika dan label lainnya yang dipakai kalangan pengusaha budidaya udang di dunia ini karena label itu hanya akan menjadi alat untuk menyamarkan atau mengelabui tindakan perusakan lingkungan pelanggaran ham maupun pemiskinan masyarakat yang telah berlangsung

395580 the bsnl board has recommended the ipo and asked the government to facilitate the listing of the company
395581 it is also decided that if the government moves with the ipo proposal the entire bsnl workforce of three lakh will get into direct action including indefinite strike other psus including hal have been granted navaratna status without listing as such the arguments put forth for ipo in bsnl are a ploy to disinvest bsnl and gradually privatise it like videsh sanchar nigam vsnl
395582 differences between the bsnl management and its employee unions to ensure that talks between the two sides continue and all outstanding issues are addressed
395583 where are the true five fold evangelists today where are the true pastors and teachers since we have been told that they were restored to the church years ago
395584 many times we tend to say we believe something simply because we see it in scripture but it takes more understanding of the ways of god than merely reading and implementing something in the bible
395585 to swallow this garbage both are wrong and both are destructive to the body of christ
395586 many will reject them because of an unwillingness to change

395596 its the song in your heart that wants you to help make yourself a better person and to help other people do the same everybody has one
395597 the object of our fraternity is to promote good fellowship to encourage studiousness and to inspire its members in seeking the best in their chosen lines of study as well as in life
395598 it could be possible that diamond industry is being targeted
395599 the population in surat has increased ferom 25 lakh to 40 lakh as compared to this there has not been any substantial rise in the police force available in the city we have already intimated our demand of more police force to states home ministry soon we will be approaching gujarat chief minister narendra modi and centre government asking for more security forces

395667 we thought he worked out really well he was a critical part of our vaccine studies

395715 the issues are increasingly coming together and the differences between the liberals and the conservatives are very clear for everyone to see
395716 if mr harper calls the house back on sept 15th as he has said he will do then i suspect it will be a very lively and intense session
395717 the choice for canadians is becoming increasingly apparent and its really just a matter of time
395718 canadians are very wary of this government and this prime minister
395719 they are not prepared to easily hand over to him and his neo conservative kind of government the keys to the kingdom and that spells opportunity from the point of view of the opposition
395720 because of the intensity of the situation many lives were saved by those people retreating
395721 in my opinion even someone with police training would have had trouble apprehending the suspect
395722 i tell my students to use physical confrontation only as a last resort
395723 in my professional opinion anyone in close proximity to a knife should retreat get to a safe place and then call authorities which is what they did

395728 todays announcement signals the beginning of the end of a way of life for generations of tobacco farm families
395729 we knew this court case was in the works thats why the money is here now
395730 as we stand here today most of our farmers have their last crop of tobacco in the field our families and communities have suffered from chronic uncertainty a big part of that uncertainty has been lifted today
395731 they went to parliament with their hat in their hands and out of desperation they kept dropping their price
395732 i think we have a roomful of pretty satisfied people who can get on with their lives
395733 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
395734 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
395735 the perpetrators of this crime do not share this communitys sense of non violent behaviour and tolerance of all people from every walk of life
395736 there appear to have been racial overtones and that makes this incident something that needs to be addressed
395737 i hope this may be a stimulus to try to assist such people
395738 it took people from a lot of cultures and a lot of colours
395739 we are hoping that we are going to get in there and get started moving the muck off the road pretty quickly
395740 there is noise emitted as the seal between two planes breaks and once it starts it becomes more detectable and noisier for want of a better phrase so by monitoring this through a sophisticated electrical filter you can tell when something is about to happen
395741 where we are building we dont have any sizable cliffs that would be going near housing
395742 these are womens lives were talking about it will affect entire families if these women dont get the treatment they need
395743 we wish the waiting lists werent like this so we dont have to make those god like decisions
395744 a slap in the face and a kick in the teeth
395745 we would not be leaving if only the problems we outlined had been heard and addressed in some way
395746 this is not crying wolf what does one do to have to capture the attention of the people who are supposed to deal with these issues what tactics are there it was truly done knowing how final it is
395747 by the time canada woke up and said lets drop the tax and make it harder for them to make a profit another idea had sprung to mind
395748 if this was beer someone selling beer in clear plastic bottles that are unmarked would you drink it
395749 said former resident doug george kanentiio a journalist who opposes the tobacco trade
395750 it then becomes obvious to the retailers that theres a risk in ordering the finished product from companies like that
395751 so how do they get around that order the raw tobacco and make it yourself
395752 they wont raise a fuss whereas with mohawks they have family you can only push them so far until they push back and you have to deal not just with that specific worker but with cousins uncles brothers and sisters and invariably relatives who are related to the actual warehouse owner
395753 its too dangerous to report it you cant tell the police that youve just lost 100 000 in smuggling money youre always nervous who do you trust theres a lot of loose money floating around the reserve
395754 i am comfortable and very confident with the advice we provide the regulators
395755 we have to make it clear to people these precautionary approaches are not using new scientific evidence that there is a risk and they are a little alarmist in nature
395756 in respect to our report we did not involve industry representatives in reviewing the evidence we choose to look at scientific evidence and review the evidence of others we urge people to be cautious
395757 one of my interests in being on the committee is trying to get a sense of what direction the industry wants to go in terms of their products
395758 its as if the referee were also coach of one of the teams
395759 should not step out of their official roles to assist private entities or persons in their dealings with the government where this would result in preferential treatment to the entities or persons
395760 when you are sitting on an industry association committee as a member you have stepped out of your official role
395761 i attend the health council meeting in a liaison capacity only i do not have influence on the agenda and do not participate in any decision making capacity with this group
395762 the question of potential conflict of interest was reviewed before i agreed to participate my participation was approved at the time
395763 industry canada ic participates in the cwta health committee as an observer and government liaison only such participation from ic is in line with the departments participation in any other industry associations related to radiocommunications in canada
395764 anyone who knowingly makes any false or misleading statement in any return or other document submitted
395765 if you dont fund research the question is why dont you fund it
395766 i dont really think about no 1 and at the moment i dont deserve it
395767 all of a sudden i just got exhausted completely lost my concentration
395768 it was hard for me to keep up because the points were quite long the longer the play went i felt worse and worse
395769 ive started to believe i can beat these top players
395770 apart from halong bay there are no equivalent sites on the world heritage list
395771 we need to win the agreement of the ruling parties
395772 the refuelling activities in the indian ocean are appreciated by the international community and there are expectations for the future
395773 what we found was men that consume the highest amounts of soy foods in this study had a lower sperm concentration compared to those who did not consume soy foods
395774 we wanted to know if it would affect sperm production and could serve as a marker for the effects on the reproductive system
395775 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
395776 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
395777 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
395778 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
395779 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
395780 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
395781 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
395782 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
395783 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
395784 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
395785 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
395786 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
395787 we love moncton because it is really easy for people to get here from a lot of different places and the investments the city and the provincial government have made to this site have done a lot to cut down the costs of producing a show and its paying off the city of moncton has been very accommodating and obliging
395788 you cant do the show without the support of the government
395789 mick jagger actually got dressed up in a disguise and walked around the crowd that day and went downtown
395790 but we still try to capture the magic moments of music we still want fans to experience something that will be with them for the rest of their lives
395791 we cant say who were going after because other people might try to get them
395792 lobjectif est de donner une ambiance de vacances mais aussi de cr er du lien de faire en sorte que les gens de diff rents quartiers se rencontrent
395793 les jours de beau temps on a pu compter jusqu 3 800 personnes

395795 quel bonheur de pouvoir marcher pieds nus dans le sable m me quand on na pas les moyens de partir en vacances
395796 cest bien pour les familles pauvres cest tout ce quelles trouvent pour se distraire les enfants adorent la baignade
395797 quils nont jamais vue m me avec le centre de loisirs
395798 saint rapha l l o vont les gens qui en ont les moyens
395799 les amener dans un endroit o ils voient quelque chose de diff rent cest bon pour leur d veloppement ici cest trop entre soi
395800 the era of treating criminals murderers spies and collaborators with mercy and amnesty has gone and the way to deal with them will be clear soon you will see executions being implemented according to the law
395801 we will respond in the same way until the bids to destroy hamas in the west bank stops
395802 13 more people were injured in overnight clashes with the army and police hundreds are out on the streets in defiance of the curfew
395803 additional forces have taken positions in sensitive areas to prevent further clashes the situation is tense but under control
395804 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
395805 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
395806 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
395807 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
395808 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
395809 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
395810 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
395811 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
395812 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
395813 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
395814 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
395815 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
395816 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
395817 the space program is an essential cornerstone of floridas economy
395818 i understand that this is a challenging and uncertain time i believe we can and will transition smoothly into the constellation program and i look forward to working with the good people of nasa and all those involved in the space program as we begin to chart americas future in space flight
395819 iran is continuing to advance toward a military nuclear capability and is heading towards a major breakthrough
395820 for us such a situation that iran will have a nuclear power is an existential threat and from the state of israel point of view it is unacceptable
395821 our estimation is that already by 2009 iran will reach enrichment capability and as soon as 2010 will have option to reach uranium production at military levels
395822 one thing is clear is iranians are continuing their policy of buying time and so far they are succeeding
395823 we all know time is a decisive element in our ability to change the picture and remove the iranian threat
395824 and the window of influence is becoming smaller and i believe about to close
395825 police chief shouldnt get involved in everyone elses business when it comes to their personal life its inappropriate
395826 if you notice since britney started wearing clothes and behaving paris is out of town not bothering anybody anymore thank god and evidently lindsay lohan has gone gay we dont seem to have much of an issue
395827 obviously hes a part of the green bay packers this is really something thats been out there all along
395828 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
395829 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
395830 these stock repurchases are enabled by panhandles strong cash flow and are an important way of returning value to our shareholders
395831 we believe these share repurchase programs clearly demonstrate our confidence in panhandles future and represent at todays prices a good value
395832 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
395833 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
395834 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
395835 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
395836 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
395837 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
395838 we are very pleased that addax petroleum chrome and kogas have initiated this project in conjunction with our countrys policy direction for gas and gas master plan this is a significant step forward in the development of nigerias substantial gas resources and its continuing economic development the combination of domestic and international interests in the consortium together with the involvement of the bayelsa state government also signifies the confidence of the respective communities in our plan and the bright future of nigeria
395839 we are extremely proud to be an early participant in nigerias gas master plan and to have received the approval of the federal government this is an important milestone for addax petroleum in the development of the considerable gas resources in our licence areas in nigeria we believe that the strong relationship between addax petroleum chrome and kogas brings together the vital and complementary international and domestic expertise required for our consortium to play a significant role in realising nigerias gas plans additionally we believe this proposed project will provide significant benefits to nigeria and its people by way of power generation employment creation and substantial foreign direct investment
395840 i am excited about working with all the stake holders of cogl as such i am committed to rebuilding shareholder value from day one
395841 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
395842 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
395843 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
395844 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
395845 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
395846 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
395847 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
395848 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
395849 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
395850 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
395851 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
395852 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
395853 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
395854 the one who does not love does not know god for god is love
395855 such men are false apostles deceitful workers disguising themselves as apostles of christ and no wonder for even satan disguises himself as an angel of light
395856 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
395857 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
395858 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
395859 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
395860 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
395861 we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error
395862 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
395863 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
395864 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
395865 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
395866 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
395867 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
395868 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
395869 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
395870 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
395871 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom
395872 if anyone speaks let him speak as the oracles of god
395873 having these promises beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god
395874 recognize those who labor among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake
395875 if sinners will be damned at least let them leap to hell over our bodies and if they will perish let them perish with our arms around their knees imploring them to stay if hell must be filled at least let it be filled in the teeth of our exertions and let not one go there unwarned and unprayed for
395876 good spiritual and gospel works prepared beforehand for us to walk in
395877 may the lord revive us and keep us far from the slippery slope of pragmatism
395878 what is pragmatism basically it is a philosophy that says that results determine meaning truth and value what will work becomes a more important question than what is true
395879 you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world
395880 if you see the son of man ascending to where he was before
395881 i came forth from the father and have come into the world i am leaving the world again and going to the father
395882 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
395883 i know that messiah is coming he who is called christ when that one comes he will declare all things to us
395884 are you the christ the son of the blessed one
395885 his name will be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace
395886 all things have been handed over to me by my father
395887 and no one knows the son except the father nor does anyone know the father except the son and anyone to whom the son wills to reveal him
395888 truly truly i say to you an hour is coming and now is when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live for just as the father has life in himself even so he gave to the son also to have life in himself
395889 this sickness is not to end in death but for the glory of god so that the son of god may be glorified by it
395890 the jews answered pilate we have a law and by that law he ought to die because he made himself out to be the son of god
395891 the jews sought all the more to kill him because he not only broke the sabbath but also said that god was his father making himself equal with god
395892 he trusts in god let god rescue him now if he delights in him for he said i am the son of god
395893 therefore i said to you that you will die in your sins for unless you believe that i am he you will die in your sins
395894 jesus said to his hearers truly truly i say to you before abraham was born i am
395895 behold i send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves
395896 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
395897 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
395898 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
395899 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
395900 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

395957 we hebben afgesproken dat ik zelf met een ander bestuurslid en een van de drie commissieleden eind augustus een wandeling ga maken door het dorp dan gaan we de mogelijke plekken voor parkeergelegenheid op een rij zetten daar rolt uiteindelijk een voorstel uit dat we vervolgens in oktober aan de ledenvergadering voorleggen op twee na zijn alle inwoners van niehove lid met zijn allen moeten we eruit zien te komen
395958 er wordt hierover al vier tot vijf jaar gediscussieerd het is nu tijd om knopen door te hakken
395959 because they currently have a limited health and dental plan we want to give them the most benefits and protect possible because they are our greatest assets people forget that the cost of losing an employee to another middle eastern gaming policy company sometimes outweighs the cost of keeping them onboard
395960 were already researching able counsel for labor union related insurance claimes
395961 because we dont want to get screwed in the event an insurance claim is denied to a respective business
395962 we believe we have a right to the same protections afforded to offline businesses despite the fact that we dont have a physical place of business
395963 our legal team has already thoroughly researched how to file an insurance claim for online business
395964 mostly because we want to expedite the payout process should we have to make a claim the internet marketing world moves much faster than the physical marketing realm and as a result we would lose significant business from any down time associated with a drawn out insurance claim
395965 once insurance companies buy into the online business sector theyre going to need able legal representation to avoid false claims likewise middle eastern gaming policy businesses will need legal representation against these big time insurance companies in order to get the disbursements they deserve im excited about the possibilities
395966 wed rather have a consistent share value over time versus a catastrophic loss of company value due to some frivalous lawsuit or liable charges the result of this decision will probably mean a 5 loss in share value for 6 months but then a slow steady recovery after that
395967 its time we catch up with the resk of the middle eastern gaming policy business community and offer solid fringe benefits for our valued employees this new package will come at no cost to employees and will be underwritten by a solid insurance company the premium charge will be higher but were banking on the fact that middle eastern gaming policy product sales will increase because our workers will be highly motivated to come to work each day
395968 as we meet today most countries of our region are faced with the curse of terrorism that threatens the peace and stability that is needed so much for the forward march of our people
395969 we need to redouble our efforts for collective action to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations it is imperative to remember the element of interdependence which is crucial for durable peace and the protection of democratic values
395970 we must ensure strengthening regional legal mechanism and intensifying intelligence sharing in order to secure the regions collective prosperity peace and stability
395971 in my view it is also necessary that we as a region endeavour to set right the many wrong impressions that exist or are promoted elsewhere about the actions that are imperative to protect our people and societies from the brutalities of terrorism
395972 terrorism anywhere is terrorism and there are no good terrorists or bad terrorists

396205 gives us tims origin story and manages to toss in a fun two face story at the same time
396206 is primarily a flashback episode with dick telling tim drake about his final days as the boy wonder and the straw that finally broke the camels back
396207 best reparations we can provide are good schools in the inner city and jobs for people who are unemployed
396208 every day we walk by them were still in the old locker room with the old showers and were overcrowded weve got i think 50 lockers and i think weve got about 70 kids in there right now with no ventilation
396209 were just excited its just a beautiful facility its something the town can be proud of our coaches are very proud of it and i think our kids are very proud of it
396210 i think all of the student body is really excited about the field that seems to be the topic of conversation anywhere i go just because it looks so nice and it is so visible
396211 55 ounce carpet its a little thicker than field turf but more durable itll play more like a natural field
396212 has financed the whole project it was a tremendous offer on his part i think all of the student body is really excited about the field
396213 they started just putting down the carpet three weeks ago its a tremendous thing to look at the time and care that it takes
396214 hopefully well be out here practicing next wednesday or thursday
396215 its still questionable exactly when the date will be that the boys will be able to start using it they are making progress and hopefully it will be certainly ready for them within the first couple of weeks of the season anyway
396216 you could use this as a setback and let it take your mind off what youre supposed to focus on but i tell the kids well get there when we get in the fieldhouse were hoping well get there sometime in september
396217 we told the kids this friday morning out here at 7 30 were playing one week from today weve got a long ways to go and anytime you have young kids in the secondary and in skill positions youve got to male sure you go slow and youve got to be fundamentally sound
396218 so we dont have as many coverages in as weve had in the past and i think weve got five running plays in thats all were working on and thats all were going to put in maybe well go to six or seven later on
396219 were just trying to get everybody comfortable so theyre playing fast and everybody knows what theyre doing
396220 weve had to put on two more people just to work the scoreboard
396221 with the donations from the community and from former football players and people who arent even in the community now weve been able to do a new scoreboard bought the weights that will go in the new weight room
396222 weve been able to supplement what the school board has given us
396223 i think the football boys are anxious to get in and start using the new weights
396224 any time you go to the state championship game three years in a row and weve been fortunate to win the district for four consecutive years and the region you start putting those numbers together and winning championships you get more people in the seats
396225 i think the community was embarrassed about the old facility we were overcrowded in the locker room people got tired of looking at that
396226 our community stepped up and the school board and the tazewell county board of supervisors gave us the money to build us a fieldhouse because our football program had outgrown the old locker room so our numbers really forced them to do something
396227 its going to help our youth program there will be no rainouts our soccer program i think youll see it flourish now because theyve got a place to practice and people will come and watch its going to be a special place all around
396228 people around the state know the upgrades are here i think youll see a lot of people model after richlands when they try to remodel their facilities
396229 it feels nice to be back out here we had over 40 kids this summer for strength and conditioning sessions so were tickled to death
396230 we had a great commitment out of our players and our coaches they have worked extremely hard theyre excited to get back out here
396231 i think if you look at tazewell theyve got all their players back and then they consolidated with pocahontas i would think youd have to label tazewell the favorites and graham second
396232 graham last year tied us for the district championship and they return a lot of players graham will be very tough again and then i would go with abingdon marion probably carroll county and grundy and then us
396233 i always throw us in last since we cant pick ourselves
396234 thats a great accomplishment to get there and i would love to get back there again and see what happens
396235 its a big accomplishment for richlands to be there and i expect us to be there just like the past three years
396236 announce the discovery of an object in our galaxy astronomers have been hunting for more than 50 years this finding was made by combining data from nasas chandra x ray observatory with ground based observations

396238 the thinking in the field is that there is a scale along which people even those considered to be normal can be placed upon and that people such as engineers mathematicians and computer scientists are nearer to the non empathising systemising end of the spectrum with people with aspergers syndrome even further along again
396239 our research supports the idea that people who are heavily involved in game playing may be nearer to autistic spectrum disorders than people who have no interest in gaming
396240 we are now confirming that based on our investigation he will not be suspended for conduct that occurred prior to his nfl career
396241 hes been one of the most excited people to be here
396242 hes a happy guy and no matter what you ask him to do whether it is the scout team or special teams whatever it might be hes responded in a positive way to everything
396243 did the defendant make mistakes sure he did serious mistakes but did he actually commit any crimes did he commit treason no i mean it was an impossible situation when the cylons arrived what could he possibly do what could anyone have done i mean ask yourself what would you have done what would you have done if he had refused to surrender the cylons wouldve probably nuked the planet right then and there so did he appear to cooperate with the cylons sure so did hundreds of others whats the difference between him and them the president issued a blanket pardon they were all forgiven no questions asked colonel tigh colonel tigh used suicide bombers killed dozens of people forgiven lieutenant agathon and chief tyrol they murdered an officer on the pegasus forgiven the admiral the admiral instituted a military coup detat against the president forgiven and me well where do i begin i shot down a civilian passenger ship the olympic carrier over a thousand people on board forgiven i raised my weapon to a superior officer committed an act of mutiny forgiven and then on the very day when baltar surrendered to those cylons i as commander of pegasus jumped away i left everybody on that planet alone undefended for months i even tried to persuade the admiral never to return to abandon you all there for good if id had my way nobody wouldve made it off that planet im the coward im the traitor im forgiven id say were very forgiving of mistakes we make our own laws now our own justice weve been pretty creative at finding ways to let people off the hook for everything from theft to murder and weve had to be because because were not a civilization anymore we are a gang and were on the run and we have to fight to survive we have to break rules we have to bend laws we have to improvise but not this time no not this time not for gaius baltar no you you have to die you have to die because well because we dont like you very much because youre arrogant because youre weak because youre a coward and we the mob we want to throw you out the airlock because you didnt stand up to the cylons and get yourself killed in the process thats justice now you shouldve been killed back on new caprica but since you had the temerity to live were gonna execute you now thats justice
396244 youre full of bile hatred poison and i know that it has something to do with ellen and im sorry for that and if you need time saul well you take all the time you want but i gotta run a ship the last thing i need is a one eyed drunk sitting down here sowing discontent and disobedience so ill tell you once again saul you can pick up that weapon and kill me or you can get your ass back into your quarters and not leave until youre ready to act like the man that ive known for the past thirty years
396245 the cylon war is long over yet we must not forget the reasons why so many sacrificed so much in the cause of freedom the cost of wearing the uniform can be high but sometimes its too high you know when we fought the cylons we did it to save ourselves from extinction but we never answered the question why why are we as a people worth saving we still commit murder because of greed and spite and jealousy and we still visit all of our sins upon our children we refuse to accept the responsibility for anything weve done like we did with the cylons we decided to play god create life when that life turned against us we comforted ourselves in the knowledge that it really wasnt our fault not really you cannot play god and then wash your hands of the things that youve created sooner or later the day comes when you cant hide from the things that youve done anymore
396246 you know sometimes i think that youve got ice water in those veins and other times i think youre just a naive little schoolteacher ive sent men on suicide missions in two wars now and let me tell you something it dont make a godsdamn bit of difference whether theyre riding in a viper or walking out onto a parade ground in the end theyre just as dead so take your piety and your moralizing and your high minded principles and stick em someplace safe until youre off this rock and youre sitting in your nice cushy chair on colonial one again ive got a war to fight
396247 i will not serve under a man who questions my integrity
396248 and i wont have an officer under my command who doesnt have any
396249 the whole fleet knows this man tried to stab me through the neck and you missed butterfingers
396250 youre born you live and you die there are no do overs no second chances to make things right if you frak em up the first time not in this life anyway like i said you make your choices and you live with them and in end you are those choices
396251 but there comes a time when you realize that the engine youve built with your blood and your sweat and your tears is being used for something so foul so perverted that it makes you sick in your heart and its then that you must throw your body on the gears and on the levers and on the machine itself and make it stop and you have to show the people who run it the people who control it that unless were free that machine will be prevented from working at all
396252 you think he gave a flying frak joe adama cared about one thing understanding why people do what they do why we cheat our friends why we reward our enemies why we go to war sacrificing our lives for lost causes why we build machines in the hope of correcting our flaws and our shortcomings why we forgive defying logic and the laws of nature with one stupid little act of compassion were flawed all of us i wanted to know why so i did what he did i spend my life with the fallen the corrupt the damaged look at you you were so ready to get on that raptor with me today
396253 when you stand on this deck you be ready to fight or you dishonor the reason why were here now remember this when you fight a man hes not your friend same goes when you lead men i forgot that once i let you get too close all of you i dropped my guard i gave some of you breaks let some of you go before the fight was really over i let this crew and this family disband and we paid the price in lives that cant happen again
396254 theres a reason you separate military and the police one fights the enemies of the state the other serves and protects the people when the military becomes both then the enemies of the state tend to become the people
396255 the mob is not usually in the habit of electing ungodly apostates who denigrate people of faith
396256 sometimes terrible things have to be done inevitably each and every one of us will have to face a moment where we have to commit that horrible sin and if we flinch in that moment if we hesitate for one second if we let our conscience get in the way you know what happens there are more kids in those body bags more kids floating out that airlock i dont know why but i have a lot of faith in you and i want you to promise me that when that moment comes you wont flinch do not flinch
396257 a few months ago it applies for those times when someone lobs a hand grenade impossibly far and takes you out you see the
396258 martin sloan age thirty six vice president in charge of media successful in most things but not in the one effort that all men try at some time in their lives trying to go home again and also like all men perhaps therell be an occasion maybe a summer night sometime when hell look up from what hes doing and listen to the distant music of a calliope and hear the voices and the laughter of the people and places of his past and perhaps across his mind therell flit a little errant wish that a man might not have to become old never outgrow the parks and the merry go rounds of his youth and hell smile then too because hell know it is just an errant wish some wisp of memory not too important really some laughing ghosts that cross a mans mind that are a part of the twilight zone
396259 anyone who drives an electric car falls in love with an electric car
396260 we could further increase the value and efficiency of a unified national grid by helping our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars an electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce the cost of driving a car reduce pollution and increase the flexibility of our electricity grid
396261 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
396262 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
396263 though realizing that many other factors were involved i reasoned that if we could get a freer flow of trade freer in the sense of fewer discriminations and obstructions so that one country would not be deadly jealous of another and the living standards of all countries might rise thereby eliminating the economic dissatisfaction that breeds war we might have a reasonable chance for lasting peace
396264 the greatest act of political courage that i have ever witnessed
396265 i guarantee you if id have showed up there and theyd have said you cant come in just by yourself and with your maybe a senate one of your staff id have gone nuts i would have called the secretary of defense and said secretary gates i want to visit these people instead apparently sen obama decided to go to the gym at the ritz
396266 for three decades ive heard speakers say things similar to what ive heard today thirty years ago they were called doomsdayers today we know enough to respect their opinions but we still havent changed our lifestyles i take good care of my clothes and they last a long time i have short cold showers and i dont own a car these solutions arent complex theyre right before every one of us

396272 we can effectively end our reliance on fossil fuels by aggressively increasing our reliance on renewable energy sources solar wind geothermal
396273 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
396274 the greenhouse gas reductions goals laid out in this bill are exceedingly aggressive perhaps to the point of being unattainable and could only be achieved through greatly increased costs for consumers and for employers

396293 the mccain commercial on this subject is completely wrong factually wrong
396294 so is that your campaign you know shtick right now that he is sort of out of the mainstream elite
396295 honestly i dont think we are focusing on it youre the one bringing it up today
396296 newly aggressive campaign to define mr obama as arrogant out of touch and unprepared for the presidency
396297 included some assertions from the mccain campaign that have been widely dismissed as misleading
396298 i have become the symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
396299 fans and numerous targathian babies have cried out for us to bring galaxy quest to comics and were all too happy to oblige
396300 lets face it is there anyone who saw galaxy quest that didnt come away wondering about the continuing adventures of jason sir alex gwen tommy guy and fred and jane
396301 weve pined away for a sequel long enough now were going to learn what became of these actors after their first greatest adventure together yes they are excited about the re launch of the franchise that made them cult icons but dont think for a moment that success has quelled their quirkiness and when they have to suit up again and take the protector out of orbit lets just say experience isnt going to make their jobs any easier
396302 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
396303 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
396304 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
396305 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge

396312 answering clintonism with ken starrs inquisition impeachment was offering a cure worse than the disease
396313 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
396314 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
396315 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
396316 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
396317 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
396318 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
396319 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
396320 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
396321 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
396322 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
396323 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
396324 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
396325 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
396326 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
396327 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
396328 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
396329 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
396330 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
396331 you know gas prices are high when texans start driving golf carts
396332 part of a growing internet subculture with a fluid morality and a disdain for pretty much everyone else online
396333 lets put a man on the moon in 10 years
396334 spoiler is a word of political bigotry i dont recognize it at all
396335 i dont think small party candidates or third party candidates are second class citizens
396336 spoiled our political system theyve turned the government over to big business
396337 none of us should be considered spoilers unless we all are spoilers
396338 it seems a vicious circle if youre not on the debates you dont reach tens of millions of people i can guarantee you if i was on the presidential debates the polls would surge
396339 are you a sports fan do you know any sports player who gives up
396340 cheering hooting and salivating youd expect at a campus rally
396341 while obama got a warm and even rousing welcome the audience was not cheering his every word
396342 one sure way to get applause from the crowd in the cavernous skyline ballroom for the opening ceremony was to mention sundays appearance
396343 many journalists in the audience leapt to their feet and applauded enthusiastically after being told not to do so during a two minute break halfway through the event journalists ran to the stage to snap photos of obama
396344 obama received a standing ovation from many in the audience at the start and end of his appearance there was also a rush toward the stage after his speech as obama shook hands and signed autographs one journalist was also overheard wishing him luck while another squealed he touched me as she left the ballroom
396345 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
396346 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
396347 what is it gov bush that you dont like about peace and prosperity
396348 what is it that you like about wars and recessions
396349 so the first thing i want to do florida is just ask you a very simple question
396350 do you think that you are better off now than you were four years ago or eight years ago and if you dont think youre better off do you think you can afford another four years of the same failed economic policies that weve had under george w bush
396351 o n the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush i will also submit that my support for president bush has been active and very impassioned on issues that are important to the american people
396352 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
396353 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
396354 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
396355 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
396356 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
396357 the main we reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
396358 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
396359 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
396360 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
396361 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
396362 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
396363 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
396364 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
396365 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
396366 i told them i was appalled by such a statement we are talking about taxpayers dollars that must be treated with as much transparency and openness as possible and spent with as much due diligence as possible to assure the best return on those tax dollars
396367 but he has no plausible way to achieve it his budget would actually move things in the opposite direction away from balance
396368 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
396369 the american society of civil engineers estimates that were going to have to spend 1 6 trillion over the next five years to rebuild our infrastructure
396370 weve let things lapse for 20 years the pipes wires asphalt bridges and radar systems are old and everything seems to be falling apart at once
396371 he hasnt talked very much about his vision for modernizing american infrastructure
396372 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
396373 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
396374 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
396375 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
396376 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
396377 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
396378 will his policies keep my family safer healthier and more prosperous
396379 liberals mock americans who love their country calling them cowboys warmongers religious zealots and jingoists liberals relentlessly oppose the military the pledge of allegiance the flag and national defense liberals malign the flag ban the pledge and hold cocktail parties for americas enemies
396380 anti flag anti family criminal rights welfare traitors endanger bizarre radical sick corrupt
396381 were doing all these message events why dont we try a messenger event why dont we find the kind of venue topic setting format atmosphere that highlights gore at his best and most likable people dont vote for issues they vote for a candidate lets show them the candidate
396382 did you see gore hes totally different he should run for president
396383 gore is not different gore is immutable that was a messenger event
396384 gloried in cultural warfare dividing the nation geographically generationally racially religiously he believed that was what all politicians did
396385 i apologize for it i did not know about these remarks but i take responsibility for them i repudiate them i will certainly make sure that nothing like that happens again
396386 i am in keeping with the vision of one ronald reagan
396387 theres a lot of us voting against obama more than anything else
396388 over the years there are a lot of issues ive disagreed with you about and i would like to know how do you assure me and other conservatives that you will hold to our values and give me something to be excited about
396389 everywhere i go i am hearing the same thing i am uneasy about obama and i think mccain is going to win
396390 it is win win all the way this fiery take no prisoners attitude is what will do it for him for the first time he is really beginning to get his moorings
396391 climate change my friend i have to tell you with all due respect is real its real and the question is how do we address it
396392 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
396393 unlike barack obama john mccains words are backed up by his votes and his many conservative achievements and conservatives take great comfort in his remarkable record
396394 that was just resting there as a negative issue but the approach he is taking is making it a positive
396395 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
396396 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
396397 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
396398 obviously senator clinton will play a major role in the convention but we have not finalized the program yet and are not making any announcements at all about the program yet
396399 has provided documents to the campaign as it combs through his background according to several sources close to kaine sens evan bayh ind and joseph r biden jr del are also being seriously vetted by the campaign staff according to sources with knowledge of the process
396400 to recap kaine was a city councilman in richmond for 4 terms a two term mayor of richmond lieutenant governor of virginia for 4 years and governor of virginia for 3 years no al gore there
396401 doesnt have to be pro choice or pro gay rights
396402 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
396403 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
396404 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
396405 116 000 jobs and nearly 19 billion in investment at risk
396406 chances would be zero because they dont work comment by jk july 30 2008 at 5 23 pm
396407 sounds like a gimmick to take advantage of this phony baloney scheme that al gore hatched to fill his own pockets with
396408 stick it on the tailpipe of every car out there
396409 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
396410 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
396411 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
396412 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
396413 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
396414 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
396415 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
396416 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
396417 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
396418 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
396419 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
396420 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
396421 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
396422 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
396423 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
396424 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
396425 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
396426 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
396427 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
396428 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
396429 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
396430 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
396431 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
396432 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
396433 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
396434 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
396435 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
396436 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
396437 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
396438 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
396439 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
396440 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
396441 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
396442 im convinced that the marketing and pr experts surrounding the obamas clued in to the enormous influence that celebrities have had on the american public particularly women over the past seven years since the emergence of us weekly star and other celebrity newsweeklies and the subsequent explosion of celebrity news and they want to take advantage of the deep affection that americans have developed for celebrities
396443 more than most presidential candidates the obamas have to introduce themselves and make sure the american public is comfortable with them they havent been on the national stage that long
396444 and they need to go in short lead publications like people and us weekly they cant wait another month or two for monthly magazine interviews they want the american public to understand who they are and who they are as a family immediately
396445 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
396446 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
396447 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
396448 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
396449 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
396450 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
396451 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
396452 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
396453 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
396454 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
396455 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
396456 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
396457 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
396458 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
396459 gore s talking about electricity generation and what hes really substituting out is one of our most abundant resources that makes us energy independent and thats coal
396460 and if oil can be obtained from our own domestic locations either the outer continental shelf or anwr or oil shale in utah and the rockies and it can be done without environmental harm now not 100 percent guarantee of no environmental harm but reasonable kinds of risks of environmental harms that would not be catastrophic then why wouldnt we why wouldnt we do that
396461 we need to explore all avenues that we can for energy many factors should be taken into consideration it has to be safe cost effective and timely we cannot be limited in our thinking
396462 did democrat mary landrieu not read the gore memo she now 21 years later for the purposes of reelection wants drilling in the gulf she and democrats have oppposed it for 21 years vote em out and join drill now drill here polar bears eat the baby seals democrats protect how stupid of democrats to save everything and lose their own souls respectfully john mcintyre
396463 how soon we forget old gore has lost it take a look at his scare brain ideas he tried to legislate when vp population control acid rain etc and now his global warming placing the blame on we the people have you read the scientific reports who disagree its costing us billions amp we the people are paying for his errors
396464 i think coal is a very good partial solution to our energy needs there is coal for hundreds of years there is also a system close to final stages of development that will use electron technology to remove toxic pollutants so2 and nox as well as particulants this system is near production just a couple of miles from congress at escrub in alexandria va add this to wind solar hydrogen nuclear and domestic oil and we would have a smooth steady and possible transition to the future sources that are not available now
396465 how thankful i am that god did not allow gore to be elected to an office
396466 dr chiltons ideas are practical and need to be implemented without further delay
396467 today i challenge our nation to commit itself to becoming 100 apple users within the next ten years
396468 ask not what ford can do for you ask what gm product you can buy
396469 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
396470 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
396471 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
396472 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
396473 by 1985 enough millions will have died to reduce the earths population to some acceptable level like 1 5 billion people
396474 we have to offer up scary scenarios make simplified dramatic statements and make little mention of any doubts we may have each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest
396475 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
396476 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
396477 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
396478 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
396479 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
396480 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
396481 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
396482 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
396483 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
396484 there may be some aspects of climate change that he and i are in disagreement on but overall i mean ive always been a supporter of nuclear power and he has not agreed with that
396485 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
396486 john mccain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming five years ago
396487 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
396488 we are in the midst of an international climate treaty process that will conclude its work before the end of the first year of the new presidents term it is a great error to say that the united states must wait for others to join us in this matter in fact we must move first
396489 let me just say again sen obama no storage and no reprocess and thats nuclear power no drilling offshore thats a way of finding oil and gas reserves dr no
396490 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
396491 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
396492 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
396493 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
396494 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
396495 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
396496 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
396497 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
396498 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
396499 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
396500 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
396501 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
396502 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
396503 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
396504 mr gore proposed dramatically improving our national electricity grid and energy efficiency while investing massively in clean solar wind geothermal and carbon sequestered coal technologies that we know can work but just need to scale
396505 were building up co2 so rapidly that were seeing the consequences scientists have long predicted
396506 the phrase clean coal is a contradiction in terms theres no such thing as clean coal now
396507 what if we could use fuels that are not expensive dont cause pollution and are abundantly available right here at home we have such fuels scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses and enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of us electricity demand geothermal energy similarly is capable of providing enormous supplies of electricity for america the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses today i challenge our nation to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
396508 mountaintop mining is an atrocity its part and parcel of the energy system thats causing global warming and the same moral blindness
396509 once again the oilman in the white house is echoing the demands of big oil
396510 americans deserve policies that free us from fossil fuels and give us better choices that will bring down our energy costs make our air cleaner and help solve global warming
396511 the idea that we can drill our way out of this is just so absurd
396512 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
396513 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
396514 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
396515 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
396516 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
396517 our apple are rebelling and they say they have a plan
396518 apparently their civilization has learned english from ancient television transmissions primarily from mtv which has seriously hampered their intellectual growth
396519 our archeo bots have uncovered a 3 000 tall statue of elvis
396520 the central computer has developed the annoying ability to read lips
396521 both are serious and must be addressed that having been said i think that the climate crisis is by far the most serious threat we have ever faced
396522 well ive endorsed barack obama im a democrat but i think that john mccain deserves credit for having provided some leadership in the republican party years ago at a time when it was needed
396523 youre looking at a different list than i am ive decided to impose a personal term limit of two terms as vice president
396524 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
396525 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
396526 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
396527 insecurity has spread to areas which were previously relatively stable in parts of north northwest and central afghanistan
396528 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups
396529 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardizing the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance to these people and threatening their lives and livelihoods
396530 the needs of its people cannot be met by the government and the u n alone
396531 i like jerry but i think a new ceo is needed
396532 i fear giving it to my children directly unless i boil it
396533 iraq is on the cusp of a serious water crisis that requires immediate attention and resources
396534 up to now we have seen nothing from the government
396535 i had fever headaches and was throwing up all the time
396536 when i was a kid it was blue and clean
396537 i know mark murphy talked to me about it in the past how important it was for brett to continue to be part of the organization after he was done playing
396538 and frankly its good for brett brett needs to stay a part of football obviously hes a part of the green bay packers
396539 the commissioner will take no action today on brett favres reinstatement request discussions are continuing between the packers and brett
396540 there isnt a perfect solution to this but mark murphy is at least trying
396541 we know what they want and where i stand his solution although awkward and unsettling for most may be the best in the end
396542 you could hand me a billion dollars and im still going to be on the field
396543 it doesnt matter to me but everyone has different situations has different views on money money is not more important than football to me right now
396544 hes ready to go back but he cant go back until the commissioner reinstates him
396545 hes not a part of our 80 man roster right now
396546 and if or when he is well deal with that then and i think our team has done a great job of just staying focused
396547 a source close to amazon with direct knowledge of the numbers
396548 it is not crazy to suggest that life actually started on mars and found its way to earth
396549 the new york times give you the lowdown on ten things that you shouldnt bother worrying about on your vacation
396550 no matter how guilty you feel about your carbon footprint you dont have to swelter on the highway to the beach after doing tests at 65 miles per hour the mileage experts at edmunds com report that the aerodynamic drag from opening the windows cancels out any fuel savings from turning off the air conditioner
396551 john mccain doesnt tell us what we hope to hear beautiful words cannot make our lives better
396552 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
396553 do you feel that thrill running up your leg yet
396554 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
396555 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
396556 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
396557 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
396558 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
396559 a city really none of us were comfortable walking in the streets to one that was basically safe
396560 the best equal opportunity employer in the country is the u s military
396561 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
396562 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
396563 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
396564 this is where terrorists can plan attacks they have sanctuary here they are gathering huge amounts of money as a consequence of the opium drug trade in the region
396565 i would look to be able to make recommendations to president bush in the fall to continue those reductions
396566 certainly there are assumptions which you could make which would make that possible
396567 i dont think theres any doubt that we were distracted from our efforts not only to hunt down al qaeda and the taliban but also to rebuild this country
396568 the interesting thing is that the people who are very experienced in foreign affairs i dont think have those doubts
396569 the troops that ive been meeting with over the last several days they dont seem to have those doubts
396570 im not yet able to put an exact time line on it per se
396571 i think the strategic goals of having time horizons are ones that we all seek because eventually we would like to see u s forces draw down and eventually all come home
396572 the day is coming when american forces will step back more and more from combat roles the day is coming when will be doing more in the way of training and less in the way of fighting those goals are being achieved now
396573 senator mccain and i and others want us out of iraq sooner rather than later
396574 but we want us out in a way that does not compromise all the gains that american and iraqi forces have made in iraq w e want to stay there to a victory because we dont want all those who have served in the american uniform there to have served or in some cases died in vain
396575 i think its important to note that barack obamas judgment about these issues has been excellent from the beginning the kind of judgment youd want in a commander in chief and others are now beginning to adopt his positions
396576 we wouldnt be discussing surges in iraq or anything else if barack had had his way we wouldnt have started that war to begin with
396577 thats not the sort of thing you say no to
396578 if john asks me and he thinks i can help him
396579 we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
396580 this climate crisis is threatening our country threatening all of human civilization
396581 we need to reset the bar and change the debate
396582 the devastating effect on main street and the rest of the country is coming from the present cost of electricity
396583 the price increases are likely to continue until we stop just taking baby steps
396584 the focus now is past president bush toward whats going to happen in january
396585 i disagreed with those who wanted a so called gas tax holiday
396586 the people of this country are ready for bolder more dramatic actions
396587 im under no illusion that theres any position with as much influence as that of president and in fact i tried to get that position but that didnt happen
396588 but i personally feel that my own best role is to try to bring about a sea change in public opinion
396589 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
396590 okay weve got it from here you can leave now
396591 when two elephants fight its the grass that suffers the most
396592 remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
396593 a residual force will remain in iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter terrorism missions against al qaeda in iraq and to protect american diplomatic and civilian personnel
396594 as an active member of the armed forces i believe that admiral michael mullen should refrain from political speeches and campaigning its the law and its a good one i am tired of having our servicemen and women used as political footballs if mullen wants to enter the campaign then he can retire and comment to his hearts content
396595 someone should inform the ghettto michelle shaniqua obama that when the republicans release her
396596 even those who back aggressive steps to combat climate change viewed the proposal with some skepticism they said the proposal was impractical and far too costly
396597 the nations senior military official warned against a plan to remove all u s troops from iraq by early 2010
396598 im convinced at this point in time that making reductions based on conditions on the ground are very important
396599 obamas remarks that if he takes office in 16 months he would withdraw the forces we think that this period could increase or decrease a little but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in iraq
396600 who wants to exit in a quicker way has a better assessment of the situation in iraq
396601 if we dont get our way we will bomb you
396602 i want this job done in 18 months now tell me how you are going to do it
396603 there is no mountain over which you can see the future

396607 consider it a pleasant surprise then that co writer helmer declan obrien has conjured up an amusing yarn on a shoestring budget with a beast that resembles the geological formation tim allen fought in galaxy quest chasing a college slacker through the woods near a small bulgarian town despite the modest aspirations of these movies its refreshing to see what a little wit and obvious affection for the genre can do

396629 this years presidential election has generated a record number of voter registrations from minority groups some speculators have suggested however that with obama being the first black presidential nominee mccain could stand to lose a number of minority votes by utilizing promotional products companies and organizations supporting either mccain or obama can keep their chosen candidates message and likelihood fresh in the minds of their employees customers or members
396630 its unfortunate that minority voters have a reputation for not turning out at the polls its so important this year more than ever for everyone including minorities to get out and vote corvests promotional products are an excellent way to reinforce a candidates message and for encouraging people to vote

396682 i had worked in womens fashions before starting the site dealing with womens lingerie quite extensively and i felt i knew a lot about the subject
396683 i looked for good vendors with quality products and paid special attention to comfort and attractiveness for the items in my store i love working on the internet i like being in front of a computer and i feel completely at home managing my store
396684 i look for good quality good looking products things people would actually be interested in
396685 first ill purchase a few for myself to have a look at them and if i like them ill post them on my web site and offer them to my customers i want them to have a great selection to choose from and order products that theyll be happy with
396686 the blog is a way of communicating with future customers
396687 id like to present new product lines and explain whats new on the fashion scene for lingerie id like to help people choose new fashions and id like to inform my customers about lingerie from a professional perspective i want to make sure my customers are educated consumers and know what they are purchasing and why
396688 i hope to expand my inventory by moving from the lingerie into additional different types of fashions like accessories handbags perfumes and shoes
396689 i already add all kinds of new lingerie items as they come out on the market making certain theyre suitable for my shop the store is constantly growing and we think the next year will have some big additions
396690 id been contemplating starting a business since 1995 but it was 1998 when i actually got started with an online store
396691 last year around june i decided i would do it right
396692 so i went through an online mentoring organization and learned the proper way to build my business site i took my time with it making sure it was really ready before launch
396693 hunting and fishing is right up my alley so i decided to go with camping and sporting goods
396694 one thing i definitely insist on is that my customers get a good value for what they pay
396695 so many ecommerce sites out there charge outrageous prices and when you get what you ordered its junk im sticking with name brand products and making deals with the manufacturers to get the best pricing to pass on to my customers i keep my profit margin very low and know my customers appreciate that im getting them a good deal
396696 we have traveled through the northwest and almost all of the united states and we have seen wildlife and western images that have inspired us
396697 weve decorated our home with one particular product weve found and then discovered that the product was manufactured in gainesville texas just 20 miles from where we live we loved their products so much that we decided we were going to market them
396698 while looking for other products i discovered an etched glass and mirror product and we have since introduced all of those items to our web site
396699 we will be introducing similar products as we have the opportunity to grow and discover other items
396700 ive written poetry and i sing and entertain and the cowboy western songs are a part of me my love for the western lifestyle and the wildlife lifestyle is included in that my wife gets a big kick out of me when i hear a bird sound i duplicate that sound in a whistle wild animals make a howl call or bark and i duplicate that this is very much a part of who we are
396701 we want to focus on wildlife themes so this will be information relating to hunting fishing and outdoor activities
396702 well try to provide information on artists of all varieties dealing with the outdoors
396703 ive always been interested in electronics so this was an easy choice for me
396704 what im actually trying to do is create a business thats almost like a wholesaler its a deep cut in prices im not taking much of a mark up on items to begin with and now were running a sale on top of those prices i want to see how that works out passing savings on to customers
396705 im almost retired so im not looking to get rich
396706 im doing this more or less as a hobby i think its fair to the customer to not take a huge margin on the product and to give them the necessary savings that other retailers dont offer
396707 ill be using my blog to promote the different products on my web site
396708 im going to do research on each of the products and give customers all the necessary details im also going to talk about my future projects and communicate with customers about our deals
396709 the business has been a challenge for me its a learning curve
396710 i like to learn new skills and while its occasionally a little frustrating it has definitely put me in contact with some wonderful people and has helped me grow as a businessperson i had been looking for a way to have a business i could manage from anywhere and this opportunity presented itself after that it was only a matter of putting in the time and effort
396711 one of the nice things is that my supplier is in the next town from me to me thats a true advantage because i can physically go there and find out about anything i need to know or to correct any problems that spring up the products i carry are all karooch essential oils which i feel are a very good product i use them myself so im not selling something that i just chose out of a hat its a product that i have faith in and that i personally know the benefits of
396712 because of the blog and the business itself i find im learning more and more about essential oils
396713 its a very healthy product and its very versatile in its uses im discovering new uses every day its very exciting
396714 im using my blog to force myself to do more research
396715 a lot of people ive spoken with dont know much about essential oils
396716 they dont know how to use them or what diffusers are homeopathic medicine has a lot of different applications but you dont have to use it for a specific reason you can just use it to freshen up a room essential oils affect our limbic system so they can make you feel refreshed or relaxed they can make a room smell good and they can make you feel good this is all far beyond a plug in air freshener because these are natural oils as i learn more i can pass on more of that knowledge its a great thing to learn for yourself but its a wonderful thing to pass on that information to others
396717 i came from a country where i was able to exercise and run outdoors every day
396718 i moved to canada where the winter makes it very tough to maintain that sort of outdoor exercise routine i tried persisting for a year or two but then i realized that i had to get myself into an exercise and training program in order to be able to train indoors without necessarily going out to a gym i knew that i was not alone in this need and thats how i got started on the idea of selling home fitness equipment
396719 i will be providing information about exercise and health both physical and mental
396720 i want to help people find the balance in their lives for exercise working toward motivation and the benefits received ill be discussing exercise programs that work for particular groups as well as helping people find their motivation to maintain that program the equipment will be discussed at length helping people discover which items are best for use in different applications so that they dont spend money on something they will not use
396721 i feel that exercise is very important for your health and wellness because theres a direct balance between physical fitness and mental health and wellness
396722 as a person becomes older its even more important to stick to a healthy self care program i am into the middle age group and because of that ive realized how important it is to stay healthy and fit maintaining all of the benefits that come from good fitness if you stay healthy the way you experience life in general is more healthy

396729 we can only encourage moving towards that openness and transparency

396739 a loving family man and passionate movie aficionado by day wallace grimm transforms into reaper he who taketh away by night keeping the streets free of evil doers ruffians and especially those who fail to return in demand and hard to find videos on time he loves his video cassette movie collection with a vengeance and that s putting it lightly
396740 my granddaughter said the explosion occured when someone turned the lights on
396741 a strong whistling sound came up from the ground floor
396742 five minutes later a strong gas smell took over the dormitories followed by the deafening explosion we felt the flames rise up around us
396743 allts det kan vara mycket olika det kan vara allt fr n att sl oss till att skicka folk p oss och ja det kan vara allting
396744 previous attempts to find better ways of encouraging skin cell growth have used chemical additives and other elaborate techniques to produce scaffolds but their success has been limited weve found that skin cells are actually very smart its in their dna to sort themselves into the right arrangement they just need a comparatively uncomplicated scaffold and each other to help them grow in a safe natural way
396745 ultimately we can envisage treatment of burns victims and the undertaking of reconstructive surgery using the scaffold and the patients own skin to produce bespoke skin for that patient
396746 as an accident prone mountain biker i find that prospect very attractive
396747 as a result of this study we have opened a free standing patient centered facility in a more convenient location designed specifically for our screening mammography patients
396748 circumcision with this technique promises to be faster safer and more acceptable to patients than conventional surgical circumcision methods
396749 circumcision is the only new hiv prevention method to demonstrate consistent efficacy in randomized controlled trials
396750 the beauty of this device is its simple innovative design
396751 although many male circumcision devices are available they have not gained widespread acceptance due to high complication rates or difficulties with surgical technique
396752 even non physician health care providers will be able to learn this procedure to safely perform circumcisions in resource poor regions
396753 it is wonderful that mrs brownlee and mr mrva are doing so well
396754 this is a great thing these donors were all able to do for the recipients and for their loved ones
396755 both the donor and recipient are doing great a lot of organization hard work and sacrifice were needed to get this accomplished its great to see the swap worked out so well for everyone involved
396756 individuals and institutions were forced out of their comfort zones to forge uncharted territory foster new collaborations explore fresh approaches to scientific investigation redesign facilities curricula and community healthcare and better prepare for future disasters
396757 crisis also gave way to opportunity in the area of healthcare infrastructure
396758 though challenges remain the majority of the health sector in greater new orleans is recovering and reforming
396759 inpatient and outpatient services have been restored but certain populations and geographic areas remain dramatically underserved
396760 we have had time to rethink and reevaluate our response to and preparations for disasters and to rebuild our communities and our personal and professional lives
396761 the commitment to the region and preserving our unique identify is stronger than ever
396762 we found significant variations for early stage prostate cancer quality indicators there were differences in care from community hospitals to cancer centers to teaching hospitals there were also disparities in care from one region of the country to another but there were no racial disparities suggesting equity in care once a patient initiates treatment
396763 if these variations in care can be eliminated thereby providing uniform quality it may lead to improved outcomes for patients
396764 our interest in using genomics to study metabolic diseases led us to screen dna from liver cells that expressed foxa2 with an assay called chip on chip
396765 we were surprised that a cluster of genes involved in lipid and steroid metabolism was identified by being bound to foxa2
396766 in order to lay the groundwork for developing new treatments we have to determine how foxa2 itself is regulated
396767 the wins paper not only outlines the realities and challenges for female neurosurgeons but offers viable solutions targeted at resolving these inequities the paper touches on the fact that that the number of neurosurgeons appears to be decreasing relative to a growing population and that there is an urgent need to attract more qualified candidates to address this potential shortage failure to attract the brightest and most talented in the applicant pool by exclusions of subtle and deniable discrimination is unacceptable this is an issue that affects the specialty as a whole and inevitably our patients and we intend to work together to resolve it
396768 while some small strides have been made female neurosurgeons comprise just an estimated 5 9 percent of the neurosurgical workforce
396769 the first female neurosurgeon received board certification from the american board of neurological surgeons abns in 1960 and there are only 189 abns certified female neurosurgeons in the united states today
396770 it is important to keep in mind that many of the changes recommended in this paper are likely to benefit all neurosurgeons irrespective of gender and will help ensure the future viability of our specialty given the challenges facing neurosurgery and academic medicine in general wins joins with all of organized neurosurgery in the desire to see neurosurgery continue to grow and prosper
396771 the clearance of the pathwork test is another step in the continued integration of molecular based medicine into standard practice
396772 in the past scientists have classified different types of cancers based on the organs in which the tumors develop with the help of microarray technology they will be able to classify these types of cancers in a standardized non reader dependent manner based on the patterns of gene activity in the tumor cells
396773 men who come closer to fulfilling their aspirations are more satisfied with their family lives and financial situations and are the happier of the two
396774 differences between men and women in aspirations for marriage and children are fairly small
396775 of course one doesnt have to be married to be happy but if thats something you really want and it is for most people then the failure to attain it can have an impact on your overall happiness
396776 aspirations attainments and satisfaction life cycle differences between american women and men
396777 a national newspaper described us a couple of months ago as a national treasure and more recently as one of the key achievements of the last 60 years of the nhs each month we provide hundreds of thousands of people with high quality evidence based health information and advice there is no doubt about it the service provided by nhs direct is now recognised as an international benchmark
396778 in general our results show that mutations in the filaggrin gene are extremely strong risk factors for atopic dermatitis and beyond that for hay fever in the case of pre existing eczema they may also cause asthma
396779 we are now interested in finding out the precise consequences of filaggrin mutations
396780 the next thing to do is to examine the metabolic pathway of this important protein in addition we want to clarify which molecular mechanisms play a role at the genetic level but also concerning the protein itself then the final aim of course is to find a therapy for patients with atopic diseases
396781 if a lack of filaggrin is such an important factor in allergic diseases it would be almost conceivable to increase production of this protein or to replace its function in other ways

396812 that was my mistake i had a car that was really good i was looking to get too much out of it and get a really good starting position versus accomplishing goal no 1 which is to get in the race
396813 its definitely not a fun thing to be a part of

396861 relat rio sobre a epidemia mundial do hiv sida 2008 elaborado pelo programa conjunto das na es unidas para a doen a onusida estima se que dessas 1 5 milh es de pessoas infectadas que representam 12 5 por cento da popula o 100 mil sejam crian as e jovens com menos de 15 anos e 810 mil mulheres
396862 esse teste mudou as nossas vidas n s decidimos que n o temos nada a ver com as outras pessoas vamos ficar juntos at que tenhamos o nosso beb e pensar seriamente em como cri lo
396863 eles foram endurecidos pela vida nas ruas e suas prioridades principais s o conseguir comida e sobreviv ncia no dia a dia eles raramente pensam nas implica es do sexo desprotegido
396864 essas pessoas t m que se sustentar ent o as meninas frequentemente recorrem prostitui o e ir o facilmente praticar sexo sem prote o elas tamb m n o t m prote o contra viol ncia sexual
396865 elas s o especialmente vulner veis porque muitas s o crian as rf s do hiv e n o tiveram estruturas familiares reais ao seu redor durante o crescimento
396866 a maioria das fam lias de rua em mombasa e nas outras localidades sucumbiram ao hiv devido ao estilo de vida n o me importa praticado nas ruas
396867 n o h programas de educa o sobre o hiv voltados especificamente para essas pessoas a maior parte dos programas se dedica a tir las das ruas
396868 nos grupos domiciliares que frequentam eles podem receber educa o sobre o hiv mas n o nas ruas
396869 muitos hospitais n o os aceitam caso engravidem d o luz nas ruas e criam seus filhos nas ruas
396870 o problema mais comum que as fam lias de rua encontram a infec o por tb tuberculose que pode ser relacionada a o hiv mas eles n o querem se expor para procurar tratamento
396871 desde que esses documentos vitais foram destru dos tornou se extremamente dif cil receber o cuidado de que preciso porque n o tenho os registos para minha cl nica pr natal

396883 os homens v o continuar a dominar essas quest es e o status quo vai permanecer assim
396884 a experi ncia j mostrou que as mulheres t m muito pouca voz em quest es relacionadas ao sexo
396885 nunca ouvi qualquer publicidade na r dio ou na televis o sobre isso e tenho a certeza que muitos outros encontram se no escuro sobre como se usa
396886 no passado eram os homens que dirigiam as coisas s custas da sa de da mulher estou satisfeita que as mulheres tenham uma escolha para se protegerem contra as itss e gravidez indesejada com este novo preservativo
396887 a n o ser que consigamos reverter essas tend ncias a n o ser que consigamos fortalecer as mulheres e reconhecer seus direitos humanos e lidemos com viol ncia baseada em g nero pouco prov vel que fa amos progresso significativo na luta contra hiv sida
396888 acho que est na hora de dizermos sim a cultura o que nos define mas se a cultura est a nos matar ent o temos que ser enf ticos o suficiente para diz lo
396889 onde h um compromisso claro e forte e uma mobiliza o de recursos nacionais e internacionais estados africanos podem demonstrar lideran a mundial em sua resposta sida
396890 a intensidade da epidemia significa que ainda estamos longe de completar nosso objectivo de acesso universal at 2010

396917 however improvement in our relations requires an atmosphere that is free from terrorism
396918 we have a duty to ensure that our people prosper and progress in a secure environment
396919 the scourge of terrorism must be removed from our midst and criminals and terrorists must never go unpunished
396920 there can be no economic growth or development without peace and security we need to take all necessary measures to combat terrorism and trans national crimes like trafficking of women and children
396921 terrorism weakens and undermines efforts towards peace and normalisation singh said adding
396922 our relationship is multifaceted and dynamic and has expanded substantially in recent years we are committed to further strengthening our relations on the basis of friendship trust and understanding for the mutual benefit of our people

396972 guvernul a decis sa taxeze veniturile neimpozabile astfel ca din luna iulie veniturile nevazatorilor si a celorlalte persoane cu handicap grav sunt impozitate cu 5 5
396973 nu stiu undeva in lume ca handicapatii sa fie impozitati in plus dupa guvernul tariceanu trebuie sa platesc impozit la cass pentru indemnizatia de insotitor pentru cartelele de masa pentru abonamentele radio telefon transport care sunt toate niste facilitati fiscale niste drepturi castigate nicaieri in lume nu se pot anula sau modifica in jos drepturile castigate
396974 cred ca prin punctul 55 din oug 93 2008 ministerul sanatatii a vrut sa introduca in baza de impozitare 5 5 la cass veniturile realizate de handicapati si it isti venituri neimpozabile in prezent conform art 42x 55k si 55l prin formularea existenta s au introdus insa in baza de calcul a cass toate veniturile neimpozabile nu numai cele de natura salariala de exemplu sume primite din asigurari donatii mecenate exproprieri despagubiri de deces subventii etc daca este asa atunci textul ordonantei de urgenta este gresit si trebuie modificat pentru ca deja produce efecte importante nu este suficient sa se clarifice prin norme pentru ca o astfel de clarificare va adauga la lege ceea ce nu este permis

396979 the gates foundation has more than vast wealth it has the power of a government without actually being bound by a nations political or economic constraints
396980 there is truth in those statements but half a dozen years ago they had a lot more coherence than they do today
396981 this memorial will serve as a lasting reminder to all americans about the importance of diversity
396982 we are thrilled that through the reach of our radio stations and the generosity of our listeners we honor dr king and his work
396983 the technology will provide access to multiple forms of communication including the world wide web and voice over internet protocol voip
396984 the bpl can be installed on existing transmission lines and will therefore not disturb infrastructure
396985 you were everything everything that i wanted we were meant to be supposed to be but we lost it all of the memories so close to me just fade away all this time you were pretending so much for my happy ending its nice to know that you were there thanks for acting like you cared and making me feel like i was the only one its nice to know we had it all thanks for watching as i fall and letting me know we were done
396986 this partnership will allow us to further strengthen our local operating capability in africa
396987 smart grid technology is ready to have a significant impact improving the efficiency and reliability of energy delivery and countries around the globe are beginning to utilize this technology to improve the performance of their electric grids
396988 we believe that this partnership can offer considerable socio economic benefits in ghana arising from introduction of intelligent electricity distribution and bpl technology for cost effective internet services we are confident that the bplg and bpl africa teams will make this first deployment a success and as a result provide an example for many others to follow and implement throughout africa
396989 bpl has its place in many areas but its not an over arching technology for every application and place
396990 we believe there is no one common technology that will make smart grids work
396991 a hybrid solution is the only way it can work
396992 the focus is clearly on the utility smart grid applications now
396993 yes 2005 was a year where bpl seemed to generate a lot of interest but 2008 is going to be considerably more with the new bills and focus on energy efficiency
396994 the ever increasing price of copper and the growing theft interest for this raw material has pushed us to think out of the box we came to the conclusion that using the existing power lines already protected would not only take care of the theft issue but offer a cost effective solution by the same token we evaluated various technologies to communicate with our gps sensors and domosys was the perfect choice
396995 we always strive to offer our customers the best and we were glad to provide state of the art gps and plc technologies in our solution there again demonstrating lindsays leadership in offering its customers appropriate tools to improve their crops
396996 it is an honour for domosys to have its technology used in yet another green solution like lindsays growsmart products
396997 we realise that these systems perform in very critical applications where one farmers crop could be wasted if communications went down so we take great pride at delivering a reliable technology and providing a solution that exceeds lindsays requirements

397003 complimenti ai 67 firmatari del documento contro la visita del papa allateneo di roma che con la loro intolleranza hanno dimostrato lo stato di desolazione delluniversit italiana e la debolezza culturale dei reduci del 68 se questi i maestri dei nostri figli c da aver paura per il nostro futuro
397004 quanto accaduto gravissimo perch il fatto che non sia possibile garantire la sicurezza per la visita del santo padre rappresenta lennesima brutta figura per il nostro paese ma anche il segno di un rigurgito di anticlericalismo come non sivedeva da diversi decenni in italia
397005 this is the beginning this ist he living spark and shines within me like a star in heaven

397010 from the moment you leave the castle until you return you are not allowed to use magic we are speaking of a muggle bikini after all
397011 mcgonagall our probation after your glorious idea to send snivellus to moony even your brother in bikini isnt worth being expelled yes wormtail whats up
397012 oh good its you prongs are you at the village already can you see the girls i would have loved to see them too

397016 i would be surprised if you stuck to the rules would be the first time so i asked snape here to provide me with some of his verita serum i am especially interested in how you managed to get past the muggle police i alerted once i saw your rat watching mcgonagalls chambers
397017 yes but didnt you hear what he just said about wormtail
397018 anything for attention thats my brother girl lets see whos a girl in the upcoming match sirius
397019 once outside hogwarts you are not allowed to use magic we are speaking of a muggle bikini after all
397020 why theres mcgonagall our probation after the little incident involving moony and snivellus and now this excursion basically announced in front of the whole school even your brother in bikini isnt worth being expelled yes wormtail whats up

397025 indeed it appears to be a bikini but there were certain rules to this bet
397026 however this does not mean that the orr believes our services or trains to be unsafe had they thought this to be the case a number of other options were open to them
397027 the improvement notice requires grand central to address specific issues relating to our safety management system by september 1
397028 we are working closely with our suppliers and expect to be fully compliant by that date
397029 jerome bowes was sacked for defending himself against an attack from behind from someone who had already been involved in a fight on the most volatile night of the year and that is unacceptable
397030 neither the met nor the btp found any cause to arrest jerome who was walking away towards a place of safety when he was assaulted and it beggars belief that lul has seen fit to dismiss him
397031 the message london underground seems to be sending out is that defending yourself against violent assault is to be regarded as a disciplinary offence and it is no wonder that our members are angry and disgusted
397032 rather than train up inexperienced office staff in an attempt to undermine our members strike lul should be asking itself why they voted so overwhelmingly to take action and re instate jerome bowes
397033 lack of funds is the only problem facing the project which should be completed by 2013 and any delay would increase the costs
397034 the homeplug powerline alliance and the ieee share the common goal of creating a single powerline standard
397035 the goal of the homeplug alliance is to focus on working with others to create the absolute best solution for the industry by creating a single standard that will benefit consumers worldwide we continue to make excellent progress and we believe it is in the best interest of those involved to incorporate the interests and suggestions of all parties large and small as we move towards a truly ubiquitous standard
397036 powerline communications addresses many varied needs and applications and as a result there are many stakeholders in the process
397037 discussing these solutions with the interested parties and addressing the technical requirements for each potential application is a challenging task but a task that we are happy to take on in an effort to propose the best possible solution for the industry

397040 kami prihatin khususnya pada prosedur bedah yang mungkin akan mengeksploitasi perempuan rentan
397041 sebagian besar operasi itu berbiaya sampai 10 000 dollar australia rp 80 juta itu jumlah yang sangat banyak

397050 this smashes the records for projects in a single year at the three bases
397051 the south jersey economy will benefit tremendously from new construction jobs and the new joint base itself will benefit from the modernization it needs to receive new missions
397052 we already have more than 500 million in construction under way at the bases aside from the 2008 and proposed 2009 funding
397053 is already proving to be a tremendous benefit for the three services and our local economy
397054 the 15 4 million in this bill for a new arresting gear testing facility ensures that navy lakehurst remains the epicenter for development and design of launch and recovery systems for the next generation of aircraft carriers
397055 this critical investment by the navy underscores their confidence support and faith in our talented and skilled workforce at lakehurst ocean countys largest employer

397071 i know it sounds silly but we might have a look at the liston stakes
397072 because if its a wet rainy day i might be very tempted
397073 if it was really wet a bog track and it happened that way it would be very helpful
397074 we thought we might aim for a race like the group three standish at flemington over the summer and we threw him in the deep end to get a guide on whether we were kidding ourselves or not
397075 now we might persevere a little bit further and might not worry about the standish
397076 it was not a stellar bletchingly stakes but it gives you a good guide as to where he is at and i thought he was very convincing
397077 he has had a pretty solid preparation but he is a tough little guy and probably has one or two runs left in him
397078 desuetude has always shown he has a lot of ability
397079 he was one of the first to come back after ei equine influenza but he went shin sore three times and was out in the paddock when the slipper was run
397080 he has enormous ability but just missed the boat as a two year old
397081 i put the blinkers on after hawkesbury because he was all over the place and he was still a tad keen today but raced better
397082 aichi is very honest and did well under his big weight 58kg
397083 neither are in the golden rose and we will look at races like the up and coming there are plenty of options
397084 weve got no excuses and hopefully it was just the soft conditions
397085 he wobbled around the turn and never looked comfortable after that
397086 tim rode him well he had a good alley and everything worked out
397087 we will have a look at him over the next few days but he may back up in the premiere stakes in a couple of weeks
397088 then i might freshen him up and look at the races in melbourne
397089 ive always thought he would be a good horse up the straight at flemington
397090 hes just below the top level but hes very consistent and honest in this grade
397091 i thought like the punters it was a race in two but the winner had good form
397092 she was beaten for speed early and that was always going to be the case
397093 but she finished it off well and that was heartening to see after all the time she has had off
397094 i think she has a bright spring in front of her and the epsom handicap will be the race we head towards
397095 ive trained several good horses hes unbelievable this horse hes a really good horse
397096 he will have a little let up and return melbourne cup day for the crawford stakes and then we will look at the colonel reeves and the winterbottom
397097 he didnt handle the very heavy conditions today we are very happy with the effort
397098 if you want to you can go out and play
397099 i am possessed by this house and can never leave it again
397100 her anger now spent she walked out through the hall
397101 es lag aber nie ein berzeugendes angebot auf dem tisch das ist w hrend des ganzen prozesses nicht geschehen
397102 instead of being more like europe we need to be more like america
397103 america is best when we solve our problems from our strengths not our weaknesses healthcare reform must be based on increased choice affordability portability and individual empowerment
397104 we need to begin by bringing fairness to the tax treatment of healthcare the current tax system penalizes millions including the rising ranks of the self employed and 40 percent of employees at small firms who pay for insurance on their own and receive no tax benefit
397105 because we all have so much at stake we are aggressively educating employees to make them healthier people and better consumers
397106 first year health reimbursement arrangement hra cost share percentage of member paid costs was similar to traditional plans while second year cdhp member cost share percentages were 4 less for both
397107 first year member preventive visits increased and second year member visits were significantly higher than those among traditional plan members
397108 cignas research based on two years of claims data adds to the mounting evidence that
397109 there was a female pushing a stroller full of groceries who was struck by a car
397110 a good samaritan followed the van updating police on the location of the suspect vehicle the driver was taken into custody and is believed to be impaired
397111 he befriended a female and a male and convinced them that he was a wealthy business owner
397112 shes the girlfriend of one of the dealers shes taking it in stride shes in good spirits her mother is beside herself
397113 we think that there have been quite a few that have been released
397114 they had millions of dollars in coke and heroin the high bail amounts shouldnt surprise anyone because of the varying role of the various parties the people who are higher up have more difficult cases
397115 esta mala bestia le envidia su magn fica locura al otro sa es la verdad no quedar otro remedio que matarlo
397116 ok you can go see anyone you want any time you want and still pay a co pay as long you stay in the network
397117 t he way that theyve amplified this you know has been troublesome
397118 and the eagerness with which theyve done it indicates they think they can exploit this politically
397119 originally i described it as a speakeasy but everyones tossing around that word now
397120 this entire venue has been designed and developed by five five endeavors
397121 i didnt believe it at first but we have spirits down here
397122 thats why i decided to name this part the ghost bar
397123 our drinks here will be made using traditional techniques and guidelines
397124 our customers will always be greeted and departed with a smile we wont have security guards well have gentlemen hosts
397125 this will be a place for the neighborhood an authentic l a bar
397126 its hard to imagine the assiniboine park zoo without a polar bear
397127 for the past two years shes had a number of small strokes thats typical of any animal that age or human for that matter
397128 shes probably lost over 100 pounds in the past year or so shes just lost her appetite
397129 it takes many years of design and construction and fundraising
397130 some zoos in the u s have spent up to 25 million on polar bear enclosures although im sure we could do it for much less than that
397131 id like it not just as a place to view polar bears but where research and education are done
397132 clearly there were a few things that we failed to consider and if so we are happy to correct them
397133 it may be the best book ever written about the life of texass greatest gift to the world
397134 if you want something to happen pretend it has already happened
397135 what most surprised us in this survey was how it goes across the generations it didnt matter if you were 16 or 65 the emotional importance of lyrics was completely consistent
397136 do you call me ratso because i remind you of dustin hoffman
397137 yeah ratso thats give me an identity and i can push the envelope even more
397138 hey larry you should come too if there has to be a reporter it might as well be you
397139 we have got to address the problem we experienced last year by not having a leadership election and a proper debate about the future of the party
397140 gordon brown should welcome that it is not the old politics of john major saying back me or sack me it is saying here is my politics and my ideology if people have other views let them name themselves and stand and lets have that debate and that leadership election
397141 we could have a leadership election which is open friendly and democratic and involves the whole country
397142 i dont think it is about the prime ministers authority any more i think it is about the future of the labour government the future direction of the labour party and the labour movement and the future of this country and i think people want to debate that

397146 kemungkinan kerja sama dengan pemerintah as ini adalah bagian dari dialog dan kerjasama antarperadaban
397147 saya terutama minta agar as tidak memandang dunia islam termasuk indonesia yang merupakan negeri muslim sebagai ancaman atau musuh melainkan teman dan mitra strategis
397148 dunia islam perlu as demikian juga sebaliknya indonesia sebagai negara berpenduduk terbesar juga jangan sampai diabaikan tidak sedikit pengamat tentang islam misalnya yang hanya memasukkan timur tengah ketika berbicara soal dunia islam

397156 hes got great stuff i mean you can see why theyre pretty excited about him
397157 i think he was throwing a little harder than the gun would suggest he had a real good curveball and it seemed like he could throw it all counts hes definitely something to be excited about

397164 no basta con decir que vamos por buen camino el gobierno asegura que hay menos pobres en el pa s debido a que la pobreza se redujo en el 2007 en 5 2 puntos porcentuales es necesario cambiar esta realidad y en las acciones que se ejecuten para ello deben actuar todos los sectores
397165 un ni o con anemia y desnutrici n cr nica va a reproducir una familia con pobreza por eso lo queremos revertir
397166 kent had offered various solutions aimed at overcoming the objections of the organisers such as not to include players who had taken part in unauthorised cricket in their squad
397167 with kents full knowledge the ecb offered essex as an alternative county to play in the champions league
397168 he was serving well and i threw in a lot of unforced errors
397169 i think i can win a masters series and id love to do it this week
397170 its emotional getting to be number one is so satisfying
397171 i am happy because i have been fighting a lot these last three years although i was happy as number two as i won a lot of tournaments but for sure number one is a goal and i am very happy

397175 our assets illegal money are being transferred to other countries so our task is how to bring that money back and catch the criminals

397180 the state police forces have a major role to perform and the cbi can assist them
397181 terrorism continues to rear its ugly head in our region it remains the single biggest threat to our stability
397182 we cannot afford to lose the battle against the ideologies of hatred fanaticism and against all those who seek to destroy our social fabric
397183 ive felt like ive not been contributing and letting the team down so today was very special
397184 its a day i will never forget because its been hard in the last few months
397185 professional sport is a difficult industry and when you havent scored runs you feel pressure
397186 having scored the number of runs i have so far this year in test cricket of course i felt a lot of pressure
397187 you try to keep believing thankfully it came around today for me
397188 michael vaughan said to me just go out there and be positive be the aggressor and it stood me in good stead
397189 the boys have been fantastic they all know its been tough for me over the last few months but the support you get in the dressing room is superb a lot of people dont know what its like
397190 everybody realised how difficult it has been over the past few months and they have said a score has just been around the corner and today proved that
397191 i havent read the papers for some time but you always tend to find out
397192 i thought we were very vigorous tonight and forced a few errors we took care of the ball and hull didnt touch it in the second half
397193 it was similar to our story last week but theres no dramas or crisis at the club we just didnt play well last week and you dont become a bad team overnight
397194 i always knew it would be tough tonight but there was a complete lack of intensity from us from the start
397195 it was a shocking effort and we had no desire or enthusiasm
397196 tell her i am sorry i did not know what i was doing
397197 ill kill the remorseless bastard who killed my baby ill never recover from this my baby is in bits they cant even find her i need her back i just want to get my baby back where she belongs
397198 that monster has taken my girl he took her life and i want his she wasnt an angel but she didnt deserve that
397199 he confessed but he is not fully responsible for his acts because he was taking drugs non stop during the four days prior to the killing
397200 we have got to address the problem we experienced last year by not having a leadership election and a proper debate about the future of the party

397222 zu 99 prozent eine hochreine chemikalie und kein lebensmittel mehr das ist nat rlich extrem bedenklich da sollte man zumindest mal drauf hinweisen
397223 natriumchlorid ist von der chemischen verbindung her natriumchlorid egal wie sie es herstellen sie haben ein natrium ion und ein chlorid ion und beide sind wasserl slich
397224 das macht es nicht aus dass wir physiologisch nach oben kommen wir m ssen ausgewogen essen damit wir genug mineralstoffe und spurenelemente bekommen
397225 himalayasalz besteht zu mindestens 97 prozent aus natriumchlorid nacl also aus kochsalz damit ist der gehalt an anderen mineralstoffen als natrium und chlorid in himalayasalz so gering dass angesichts der blichen verzehrsmengen dieses produkt keinen nennenswerten beitrag zur bedarfsdeckung von mineralstoffen und spurenelementen au er na und cl leisten kann
397226 wir wissen das siedesalz ist ein hochreines natriumchlorid natriumchlorid ist nat rlich eine in der natur vorkommende chemikalie rein wissenschaftlich betrachtet wir k nnen sagen das siedesalz besticht durch seine optik seine reinheit aber auch das steinspeisesalz hat seine vorteile es ist ein nat rliches untert giges produkt ein steinspeisesalz verf gt im durchschnitt ber 99 prozent natriumchlorid ein sehr reines salz

397229 das kilogramm fleur de sel kostet 20 euro das ist nat rlich ein hoher preis wenn man sieht wie viel auf so eine portion draufkommt 1 5 gramm dann ist das ja gleich gar nix wenn man sieht wie man mit dem geld ein wahnsinniges resultat rausholt dann ist das wirklich eine sinnvolle geschichte

397282 we had a lot of young players out there particularly across the middle of the park and the lads showed a little bit of character after going one down
397283 hereford are a week ahead of us in their preparations while our team were probably playing together for the first time but it ended up being quite comfortable and we could have won by more

397308 ten years ago the internet was one tenth as fast as it is today and it was perfectly adequate and society worked perfectly well
397309 but with 10 times faster the opportunities to move all sorts of new data like video and voice and presence through the network immediately arose
397310 so this is a case where we were choking off imagination
397311 its as if weve changed from am radio to fm radio and the improved fidelity means we can put more information into the same bandwidth
397312 its as if on a highway weve squeezing four or even eight cars in the place where one car would have been otherwise
397313 of course if we were to try to do this without the digital signal processing we use at both ends of the link then thered be an awful pileup
397314 people are wired at home theyre wired in the office its the space between where there are challenges
397315 wimax is about three to five times faster than 3g and about five times cheaper than 3g
397316 3g can deliver a certain level in between but wimax can deliver so much more and in a much more cost effective way

397324 for me bayern are without a doubt one of the best clubs in the world
397325 i remember when my father took me to the estadio da luz as a child to see benfica play bayern
397326 back then there were fantastic players like franz beckenbauer gerd muller sepp maier or karl heinz rummenigge and it was really fantastic
397327 we are still in the phase in which i am getting to know the players and they are getting to know me
397328 unfortunately key players walter samuel ivan cordoba cristian chivu and zlatan ibrahimovic are absent through injury
397329 bayern have already played the super cup and are close to the start of the bundesliga
397330 they are already further than we are we only started training a good two weeks ago because the serie a season does not start until the end of august and i expect a tough game but thats fine
397331 a patient to periodically renew a doctors recommendation regarding medical marijuana use
397332 the main theme and lessons drawn from these two cases is that these guidelines that the state has established if they are to be legitimate at all need to be considered thresholds not limits
397333 thats important because the legislation at least the intent of the legislation was never meant to cap the amount patients could cultivate or possess the intent was to set guidelines that were helpful to law enforcement but not set limits
397334 this is so inconvenient i dont even want to imagine longer lines
397335 we know that offices are going to be challenged so were moving people around to keep them open and meet our customers needs as best we can
397336 the operations will continue how theyre going to be impacted we dont know yet were going to do our best to keep meeting the goals and objectives
397337 hospitals clinics schools community colleges local governments and every california family who relies on these services are facing the reality that community pillars are no longer receiving funds from the state
397338 this game of kick the can has gone on long enough we understand that a compromise means spending cuts however we urge our legislators to reject any plans to cut our community health care systems which families rely on during tough times like these
397339 at a time when people are walking away from their homes because they cannot afford to make their mortgage payments or feed their children these workers deserve the right to go in to work each day and that their wages will be sufficient
397340 we shall not flag nor fail we shall go on to the end we shall fight in france and on the seas and oceans we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air we shall defend our island whatever the cost may be we shall fight on beaches landing grounds in fields in streets and on the hills we shall never surrender and even if which i do not for the moment believe this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving then our empire beyond the seas armed and guarded by the british fleet will carry on the struggle until in gods good time the new world with all its power and might sets forth to the liberation and rescue of the old

397407 in the right hands sargent that could be a deadly weapon
397408 in the last two games we have created several chances but either the opposition keeper has played really well to stop us from scoring or we have just missed the target
397409 there is no problem i am sure the goals will come and the important thing is that the players are creating chances
397410 when they have more sharpness they will score more goals at this stage it is all about preparing for the start of the season and i know that when the season begins my players will be ready
397411 i know we have the players to score goals last season fernando torres steven gerrard ryan babel dirk kuyt yossi benayoun and peter crouch all got double figures for us
397412 crouch has left but we have brought in robbie keane who also got double figures for tottenham so i am not concerned

397416 i havent had any contact with roma but i know that the italian club has made an offer to valencia for the player
397417 i do not know in what terms or circumstances this offer was made but i can confirm that roma did offer a certain amount for silva
397418 i think there are two very important things about this draw firstly the second game is at home which is really really important clearly that makes a massive difference to play the deciding game in front of our own fans
397419 im also pleased because the travelling isnt a problem we dont have to go too far which is good news especially when you look at some of the teams we could have drawn
397420 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect
397421 we know some things about their team already but we will now watch more videos and get reports from our scouts before the first game
397422 of course we know about oguchi onyewu because he spent some time with newcastle axel witsel is a good young player and wilfried dalmat is probably the best player in their team
397423 alexandre da silva is a good defender as well so we know they wont be easy opposition for us
397424 overall though it is a good draw and we are happy
397425 my aim is to score more than last season which is what i am working towards
397426 i at least have to aim to equal last years figure because it is very important to bring goals to the team
397427 getting my mind back on liverpool after the european championships will not be a problem all of us spaniards came back happy full of confidence and with a real desire to stay at the top and keep on winning we want people to continue talking about us we now have another chance to leave a mark with the premier league and the champ ions league i am coming into this season with all the desire and hope in the world
397428 people are talking about us winning the premier league again because we have been some way off for the last few years it has been 19 years since we won it we also have to be among the best teams in the champions league again we are a very competitive side over two legs and im certain that we can go a long way
397429 robbie keane really wanted to come to us and i think he is going to bring us an enormous amount hard work goals and experience
397430 he will bring the level of the team up a notch and im sure he is going to be very important this season
397431 but the tactical lay out of the team and whether or not we are going to play two up front is down to rafa
397432 they took away our manager and now they are complaining that others are trying to take their players
397433 their style is demonstrated by the way they contracted ramos
397434 victor sikora is a fc dallas player for at least the next four months if the american team is happy with his performances they have the option to extend the deal for up to an additional three years
397435 i dont know because ive asked phil gartside bolton chairman and hes not aware of it and im not aware of it i presume it is our kevin davies
397436 weve not had anything other than a conversation a month ago of you wouldnt sell kevin would you
397437 kevin i believe in the next 24 to 48 hours will be signing a new deal to put another year on to his contract hopefully
397438 ein schwarz gr nes b ndnis kann ich mir derzeit nicht vorstellen da liegen welten dazwischen
397439 das tut keiner demokratie gut wenn eine partei fast ein halbes jahrhundert die absolute mehrheit hat da ist herrschaftsdenken selbstverst ndlich
397440 ich sch tze die arbeit meiner mutter ihre partei weniger
397441 ich bewundere sie daf r dass sie in einer konservativen partei als mutter dreier kinder die gleichberechtigung schon vorgelebt hat
397442 jede religion muss einen w rdigen und repr sentativen platz zum beten haben d rfen
397443 das ist das normalste in einer demokratie eine andere parteipolitische meinung zu haben als die eltern
397444 asi que podria correr enmedio de la nada al centro de mis miedos mas frustrados
397445 debes estra muy aburrido para hacer esto o escribir una cosa asi
397446 here is now however some light at the end of the tunnel and a serious prospect of attracting new investment and putting these difficulties and the abc loan permanently behind us many of us are working hard to secure this investment over the next few weeks if it comes off we will be able to consign the discussions and post mortems about abc and all the rest to the musings of football historians and concentrate on what should be a very bright future i am sure fans will understand if the board concentrates on securing the new investment over the next period rather than responding to every piece of speculation in the media as soon as it is possible to make an official announcement one will be made
397447 if the deal doesnt happen by the end of the month the club will go bust
397448 this deal if it goes through will be the best thing to happen to qpr in a long time i know the people involved but there is still a lot of negotiating to do id be surprised if anything happened by the end of the week
397449 the trouble is that the more foreign owners you get the greater the danger of the balance of power changing
397450 football as it has been regulated for years could be in danger if the foreignowned clubs gain a majority and decide to get together they could start to dictate how the league is run
397451 if someone came in with a large amount of money they would be saving the club
397452 the club needs to find someone to re finance the structure of the abc loan it is imperative that something is done about this
397453 if these names are being mentioned it can only be good news
397454 we have had some discussions but nothing has been signed
397455 the club needs to find someone to re finance the structure of the abc loan it is imperative that something is done about this
397456 you dont want someone buying the club just because it is in the west london area and they see it as an investment
397457 that is my main concern these people might have a lot of money but how would they invest it
397458 if somebody offers me something i think is good value i will have a go im interested in anything if its cheap enough
397459 i think it is flavio im not in discussions with anyone the only way i might get involved in football is if arsenal is up for sale at a sensible price and i could take total control
397460 anyone who takes over has to show they want to take the club forward
397461 it has to be someone who wants to go in there and do things the right way which would mean investing money to take qpr back to the premier league
397462 you dont want someone buying the club just because it is in the west london area and they see it as an investment
397463 that is my main concern these people might have a lot of money but how would they invest it
397464 i would like to see a restructuring at all levels apart from the management team
397465 i want to see qpr taken forward and that might mean a restructuring of the board
397466 a lot of unsavoury things have happened at qpr and there needs to be a lot of work done behind the scenes to get the club back to where it was
397467 if someone came in with a large amount of money they would be saving the club
397468 the club needs to find someone to re finance the structure of the abc loan it is imperative that something is done about this
397469 we are in the early stages we have had some discussions but nothing has been signed
397470 it is something that has been brought to our attention and there have been some superficial preliminary talks
397471 there is nothing concrete so far at all nothing signed or discussed beyond a very preliminary stage
397472 chelsea may never have been purchased by roman abramovich had negotiations to sell the london club to the formula one pair bernie ecclestone and flavio briatore moved at a faster pace
397473 we had a big programme to take over the club when abramovich arrive by boat
397474 he buy chelsea from under our noses while me and bernie are in the middle of negotiations to do the deal it is funny abramovich and bernie are very big friends and i meet him many times we were on our way with chelsea me and bernie and abramovich put a stop to it
397475 the techniques of management are the same whether you run a clothing company or a football club management is the way you produce your product your efficiency your creativity and the people you choose to make the dream come true

397651 his entire life as best i can tell is one in which hes always been a thoughtful listener and questioner but hes never stepped up to the plate and taken full swings
397652 at the harvard law review obamas management style was to listen to what everyone had to say on contentious issues and then say something that permitted all factions to come away thinking that he agreed with them several people quoted in the story say that obamas own views were never quite known this approach may have succeeded in gaining the law review presidency the story says but to capture the presidency of the united states will require obama to take strong positions that reward specific constituencies

397666 is a trademark of iraqi leader saddam husseins biological weapons program
397667 only one country iraq has used bentonite to produce biological weapons
397668 there is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link iraq with last falls anthrax terrorism
397669 detected an apparent anthrax leak in december 2001 at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation but did not report it
397670 the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack iraq
397671 now that we know that the us govt believes that anthrax came from the inside shouldnt cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on
397672 theres either a significant amount of money behind this or this is state sponsored or this is stuff that was stolen from the former soviet program
397673 if the now deceased ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks then that means that the anthrax came from a u s government lab

397740 theres a big sign that alerts you to the fact you are entering a 20mph zone then you are met by a whole load of messages saying in fact you can still go 30mph
397741 they were put in around new year i think and everyone thought maybe they were going to take down the 30 signs and paint over them but it doesnt seem to have happened at all
397742 all around here its a bit confusing because when you drive up to wester hailes from sighthill its not really clear whether you are supposed to be going 30 or 40
397743 perhaps this is symptomatic of the lib dem snp administrations stop start policy
397744 there are roads in the city when one minute youre at 40 then 20 then 30 and up to 60 its quite unnecessary
397745 and then when you ask for street signs for specific reasons it becomes harder ive been calling for a horses warning sign near blinkbonny but was told it would create too much street clutter meanwhile in baberton crescent seven twentys plenty signs were put up
397746 my old ward used to cover sighthill avenue and we worked hard with the local residents to introduce street calming measures this will cause a lot of confusion if we want motorists to abide by these regulations then we have to be clear about them
397747 a team have been out and while the signs are close together they are both technically correct
397748 there is a larger turnout of chinese paraders this year but we also have a contingent from buddhist organisation falun dafa which has carried out protests outside the chinese consulate for some years but have continually walked side by side with chinese paraders
397749 when the festival was set up in 1947 it was with the aim of casting war and politics aside in the name of drama and the arts and this is still as true today as it was then
397750 the cavalcade was started over 30 years ago by the eif but its grown to become a showcase for the fringe the mela the jazz festival and the tattoo
397751 its a tough job bringing all of these people together ive been doing the organising almost single handedly up until the day that is since 2004 and its a massive administrative task
397752 its a fun day though so it will all be worth it
397753 we expect in the region of 175 000 people to attend this years cavalcade and we have the appropriate number of officers in place to ensure the safety of the public and participants
397754 its frightening very frightening i think people should be told when they have someone like that living next door to them
397755 im horrified i got the impression he was violent its frightening very frightening i think people should be told when they have someone like that living next door to them
397756 he used to shout quite a lot it wasnt nice but back then we didnt know about the guys history

397758 kalau benar keluarga om adalah hadiah terindah mengapa om kepengin nikah lagi itu kan sama artinya menyakiti hati kaum perempuan
397759 ive lived here for 17 years and ive never seen the street turn into a river before theres a dip in the road outside the front entrance to the stairway where the water eventually gathered and it didnt disappear for over 12 hours
397760 it appears that the existing drains have been removed from amongst other locations outside my house at the pedestrian crossing opposite stafford street
397761 we told them not to remove the drain months ago as the next nearest one is 100 yards up the road but they insisted one was enough
397762 whilst i can accept that there has to be disruption and general inconvenience as a part of putting the tram in i didnt realise that we were signing up to flooding peoples houses
397763 we are being told the flooding was caused by a once in a century meteorological event i wonder then if we can expect noah to be sailing down princes street anytime soon
397764 we are confident that none of the work we carried out in the area recently could have been responsible for any flooding
397765 this would affect every service and while its sad that its come to industrial action it shows just how much is provided by local government
397766 at schools head teachers will have to carry out a risk assessment before deciding whether to open but there is a long history of problems with heating on the first day of school
397767 at public venues local authority workers have to check that rules are being followed and if that person isnt there then the venues cant open
397768 but there is time to stop this going ahead and the employers need to come back to the table with a revised offer
397769 pay rises are something that affect everybody whereas service cuts are quite local and some people are more passionate than others
397770 although we havent yet had formal notification we understand that there is going to be industrial action on august 20
397771 management will be meeting with local trade union representatives to find out their plans in respect of local services in the meantime we will keep our contingency plans under review should industrial action go ahead
397772 the second phase of this project has produced more achievable targets for improving services and reducing costs within the council
397773 weve already started making headway by streamlining agency costs and making revisions in procurement and home based care services
397774 theres still a long way to go to enable us to fully maximise potential savings but i stress once again that this is not an exercise about reducing jobs but about making the council an even more effective organisation

397788 we heard this bloodcurdling scream and turned around and the guy was standing up stabbing this guy repeatedly like 40 or 50 times
397789 when he was attacking him he was calm like he was at the beach
397790 there was no rage or or anything he was just like a robot stabbing the guy
397791 was cutting his head off and pretty much gutting him
397792 we put our bodies up against the door waiting for him to come out and he went back and brought the head to the front and pretty much displayed it and dropped it on the ground in front of us
397793 dropped the head and went back and started cutting the body back up
397794 he sat in the front at first everything was normal
397795 we went to the next stop and he got off and had a smoke with another young lady there when he got on the bus again he came to the back near where i was sitting
397796 he put his bags in the overhead compartment he didnt say a word to anybody he seemed totally normal about a half an hour later we heard this bloodcurdling scream
397797 we want to make sure that the process is followed as aggressively as possible a full legal process and the perpetrator is definitely dealt with the full force of the law

397880 terus alexa gimana dia kan ketua kelas bagaimanapun juga dia tidak bisa diam melihat sikap sam
397881 rencana kamu untuk menghadapi sam apa kamu akan melaporkan dia ke guru
397882 kenapa bukankah dia sudah keterlaluan baru semalam masuk ke sekolah ini tapi sudah berani macam macam apalagi kalau dia sudah lama di sekolah ini
397883 mm mungkin sam punya alasan tertentu sehingga dia menghajar kakak itu
397884 bisa nggak ya nanti kalau kita udah lulus sekolah punya mobil sebagus itu
397885 bisa aja kamu kan tinggal bilang sama o om dan tante
397886 maksud aku bukan mobil hasil minta minta dari orangtua tapi mobil dari hasil keringat kita sendiri
397887 apa hanya belajar dengan baik saja kita bisa dapat mobil
397888 kalau itu saja cukup harusnya kita sudah punya mobil dong
397889 yee maksud aku bukan sesimple itu nanti kalau kita belajar dengan baik tentunya kita punya prestasi dong nah dengan prestasi kita bisa mendapat uang banyak uangnya kita tabung sedikit demi sedikit begitu uangnya sudah cukup kita bisa beli mobil dong
397890 ya iyalah tapi yang penting kita punya mobil daripada dimasa tua kita juga tetap nggak bisa ngerasain gimana punya mobil sendiri
397891 baguslah mm lex mama senang banget kalau seandainya kamu bisa balik lagi kayak dulu kamu cerita banyak soal pelajaran di sekolah soal kegiatan kalian berempat di sekolah mama kangen mendengarnya lex
397892 dulu mama tidak melarang kamu pacaran karena mama yakin kamu bisa menjaga diri dengan baik dan kamu punya sahabat yang selalu setia menjagamu tapi begitu melihat keadaan kamu yang sekarang mama menyesal telah memberimu izin kalau saja mama tidak mengizinkanmu mama tidak akan melihat puteri mama berubah jadi aneh seperti ini
397893 kamu mau kan bikin mama bahagia mama ingin kamu seperti dulu lagi
397894 koq kamu bertanya seperti itu siapa yang menuduh seperti itu sama kamu
397895 itu ma di kelas alexa ada anak baru namanya samuel tadi di sekolah dia berantem sama kakak kelas alexa nasehatin tapi dia malah menuduh alexa munafik
397896 yah kalau kita hendak berbuat baik ada saja orang yang tidak suka dengan sikap kita lalu menuduh kita munafik kamu jangan tersinggung biar saja orang menuduh kita munafik asalkan kita percaya apa yang kita lakuin itu sudah benar mama setuju kamu menasehati teman kamu itu kamu jangan peduli walaupun dituduh munafik yang penting kamu percaya kalau niat kamu itu baik dan tulus
397897 itu kan kamu sendiri yang lebih tahu tapi mama yakin anak mama ini bukan orang seperti itu
397898 oh iya mama boleh tahu kenapa dia berantem sama kakak kelas kalian
397899 sebenarnya alexa juga nggak tahu ma sam bilang dia punya alasan kenapa sampai berantem sama kakak kelas tapi alexa bilang sama dia apapun alasannya dia tidak bisa main kasar sama orang
397900 mama setuju sama sikap kamu lex dalam menghadapi setiap masalah tidak harus diselesaikan dengan main kasar kamu jangan menyerah mama mendukung kamu untuk terus menasehati dia biar saja orang menuduh kita munafik sok alim atau apapun asalkan kita sendiri yakin yang kita lakukan adalah baik
397901 yah berbuat baik itu memang punya resiko yang berat tapi jangan karena memikirkan resiko itu kamu jadi berhenti berbuat baik
397902 nggak ada pr ma jadi aku belajar sendiri di rumah
397903 begitu ya sudah kamu mandi ya jangan lama lama biar nggak masuk angin
397904 nggak ma romy nggak bisa tidur karena mama sama papa baru pulang
397905 yah kan kamu sendiri tahu mama sama papa itu punya kerjaan banyak di kantor jadi kamu tidak perlu menunggu sampai kami pulang dulu
397906 ma kapan sich mama sama papa bisa punya banyak waktu di rumah
397907 apa maksud kamu bertanya seperti itu kamu sendiri tahu jawabannya karena papa sama mama sibuk mengurus kerjaan dan mencari duit untuk kamu
397908 kenapa apa papa harus menemanimu di rumah tiap hari kamu kan bisa mengajak si james si ely sama si alexa untuk main kesini
397909 pa aku butuh mama sama papa sehari saja menyempatkan waktu untuk menemani romy lihat ma pa sahabat sahabat romy selalu diperhatikan sama o om dan tante
397910 jadi maksud kamu papa sama mama tidak perhatian sama kamu ha lihat uang jajan uang sekolah apapun yang kamu minta kami selalu memberikannya perhatian apalagi yang kamu mau
397911 apa uang jajan kamu kurang banyak atau kamu ke sekolah ingin bawa mobil semua bisa papa berikan
397912 romy tidak butuh itu pa romy cuma minta papa sama mama memberi waktu sedikit saja untuk menemani romy main atau jalan jalan
397913 romy romy sudahlah kamu jangan terlalu banyak menuntut kamu itu sudah dewasa
397914 romy dewasa bukan berarti tidak butuh perhatian papa sama mama
397915 tapi mama sama papa kerja rom harusnya kamu yang ngertiin kami semua yang kami lakukan hanya untuk kamu jadi sebaiknya kamu jangan terlalu banyak menuntut
397916 romy kamu bukan anak kecil lagi yang harus kami perhatikan terus kamu sudah bisa menjaga diri kamu sendiri
397917 percuma saja romy ngomong romy tidak pernah didengarin seandainya romy punya orangtua seperti orangtua sahabat romy mungkin romy tidak menderita seperti ini
397918 apa maksud kamu bicara seperti itu ha kamu menyesal punya orangtua seperti kami begitu dasar anak tak tahu diuntung
397919 dia memang pantas papa tampar dia sudah tidak menghormati orangtua
397920 mama tidak perlu lagi perhatian sama romy romy sudah dewasa kan
397921 mulai sekarang romy tidak akan menyusahkan kalian mama sama papa tidak perlu lagi memperhatikan romy apapun yang romy lakukan mama sama papa juga tidak usah peduli lagi
397922 romy apa maksud kamu bicara begitu ingat papa tidak akan membiarkan kamu diluar sana bergaul sama orang orang nggak benar
397923 mm iya tadi waktu aku mandi mataku kemasukan shampoo jadinya begini dech
397924 koq tumben mata kamu bisa kemasukan shampoo mandinya sambil ngeres ya
397925 habis tumben tumbenan hari gini mata kamu kemasukan shampoo yah kalo bukan karena ngeres apalagi coba alasannya
397926 maafin aku ya sobat aku tidak jujur sama kalian aku tahu aku salah sebagai sahabat aku sudah bohong sama kalian tapi aku tidak mau kalian tahu keadaan keluargaku yang sebenarnya selama ini aku bohong kalau sebenarnya mama sama papa tidak memperhatikan aku seperti kalian yang selalu diperhatikan o om sama tante aku malu kalau harus menceritakan keluargaku yang tak pernah akur maafin aku
397927 yah nich anak gitu aja pake ngambek kita becanda lagi
397928 kan aku udah bilang cuma becanda ya udah kalau masih marah kita bertiga minta maaf
397929 yeee kita bertiga sendirian kali yang nuduh romy ngeres kan kamu
397930 oh iya hari ini kita ada ujian matematika gimana persiapan kalian
397931 di ruangan ini kan nggak ada yang bisa menandingi nilai kita jadi tenang aja jams
397932 kalau kamu ada urusan sama alexa berarti kamu juga berurusan sama kami
397933 kata siapa apa kalian punya peraturan tertulis seperti itu nggak kan aku harap kalian bertiga jangan coba coba ikut campur salahkan dia karena sudah berani ikut campur sama urusanku
397934 awas kalau sampaiterjadi apa apa sama alexa kami tidak segan segan akan menghajar kamu
397935 sudah rom alexa pasti bisa menghadapinya sendiri kamu kan tahu sifat alexa
397936 justru itu jams alexa itu suka nekat aku nggak mau karena sikapnya yang suka nekad sam menyakitinya
397937 kamu jangan terlalu cemas rom aku yakin alexa bisa menghadapinya ini kan salah kita juga kita yang memaksa alexa ikut campur sama masalah sam
397938 bagaimana aku tidak cemas rom tapi aku bisa tenang karena aku yakin alexa bisa menghadapi anak itu alexa bukan anak kecil jadi dia pasti tahu bagaimana cara menghadapinya
397939 kamu tidak perlu bohong sama aku sebenarnya kamu takut tapi berusaha menyembunyikannya
397940 aku memang takut sama kamu tapi bukan berarti aku akan membiarkan kamu mengulangi perbuatanmu kayak kemarin
397941 tapi kamu mengganggu anak anak di sekolah ini kita semua satu sekolah itu artinya kita sudah menjadi teman kalaupun dia punya salah sama kamu kamu tidak perlu main kasar apa susahnya maafin kesalahan orang
397942 aku bukan orang yang dengan gampang memberi maaf sama orang
397943 kamu akan merasa lebih puas kalau bisa memaafkan kesalahan orang lain dengan ikhlas
397944 okey mungkin aku bisa menerima saran kamu yang bagus itu tapi sebelumnya aku mau tanya apa kamu bisa memaafkan dia
397945 itu tidak penting sekarang yang aku butuhkan jawaban dari kamu apa kamu bisa memaafkan dia kalau memang belum bisa kamu tidak perlu menasehati aku jangan mau jadi orang munafik
397946 hanya itu yang ingin aku bicarakan denganmu jadi aku rasa kamu sudah paham urusan kita selesai aku pergi dulu
397947 terus untuk apa dia membawa kamu keluar kalau tidak ada yang mau dibicarakan
397948 ya jelas kamu bohong nggak mungkin dia menarik kamu keluar kalau bukan untuk membicarakan sesuatu hal apa kamu tidak mau jujur sama kita apa kamu tidak percaya lagi sama kita apa kamu tidak mau lagi bersahabat sama kita
397949 okey okey tadi aku sama sam memang ngomong tapi masalahnya sudah kelar jadi tidak ada gunanya dibicarakan lagi
397950 kamu harus cerita paling tidak kita bertiga tahu apa yang kalian bicarakan
397951 aku tidak akan ikut campur lagi sama urusan dia aku tidak layak menasehati dia
397952 apa maksud kamu tidak layak setiap orang berhak menasehati orang lain yang melakukan kesalahan
397953 iya dan dia memang benar untuk apa aku menasehati dia agar mau memaafkan kesalahan orang lain sementara aku belum bisa memaafkan gio
397954 apapun masalahnya tetap saja aku akan jadi orang munafik rom dan aku minta kalian jangan memaksa aku lagi untuk ikut campur sama masalah dia kalau kalianmau menghalangi perbuatannya lakukan saja tanpa aku
397955 kalian ingin aku berbuat apa aku bukan pahlawan lebih baik kalian melapor sama guru guru yang bisa menghentikannya
397956 kamu yang harus melaporkannya lex itu adalah tugas kamu sebagai ketua kelas kalau kami yang melaporkannya kamu bakal dimarahi sama guru
397957 aku tidak peduli dan aku tidak akan pernah ikut campur lagi sama masalah dia dan aku sudah bilang itu berkali kali sama kalian
397958 kamu lihat lex romy marah gara gara ksmu nggak mau bertindak romy benar lex kamu harus mengambil sikap kelakuan sam memang harus dilaporkan ke guru
397959 sudahlah jams aku kan sudah bilang aku nggak mau ikut campur urusan dia
397960 kenapa apa hanya karena dia menuduh kamu munafik ini demi kebaikan kita semua
397961 apa kamu masih bisa bersikap tak acuh dengan sikap sam dia itu udah keterlaluan lex ingat lex kamu ketua kelas yang harus bertanggung jawab terhadap anggota kamu harus melaporkannya sama guru
397962 aku tidak punya bukti jams mana ada anak anak yang mau jadi saksi didepan guru mereka takut kalau sam akan menghajar mereka
397963 aku sekolah disini jadi mau aku dimana nggak ada yang berhak melarang
397964 untuk apa itu juga tak ada yang berhak melarang aku
397965 apa kamu belum puas membuat keributan di sekolah ini sebenarnya mau kamu apa
397966 aku kan sudah bilang aku tidak butuh nasehat dari kamu
397967 aku tidak keberatan kamu menuduh aku munafik tapi tolong hentikan semua perbuatanmua itu kamu sudah banyak menyakiti orang
397968 sama ibu kamu kalau iya aku akan memohon pada beliau agar menghentikan kelakuanmu itu
397969 jangan pernah bawa bawa nama ibuku sekali lagi kamu mengulanginya aku akan membunuhmu paham
397970 i iya ak aku minta maaf aku tidak sengaja membuatmu tersinggung
397971 kalau kamu takut sama aku jangan pernah ikut campur sama urusanku aku tidak mengganggumu dan jangan sampai karena sikapmu aku mengganggumu
397972 sam aku memang tidak pantas menasehatimu tapi tolong kamu dengarkan aku mungkin kamu pernah dikecewakan teman temanmu tapi kamu jangan menilai semua orang sama tidak semua orang jahat
397973 kamu mau bilang kamu sama sahabat sahabatmu itu orang baik baik
397974 aku tidak bilang begitu aku hanya mengatakan tidak semua orang itu jahat kamu jangan menilai orang hanya dengan melihatnya dari masa lalu
397975 lebih baik kamu tutp mulut dan simpan nasehatmu itu untuk kamu sendiri aku tidak akan percaya sama siapapun
397976 rom aku sudah mencoba meminta sam merubah kelakuannya tapi dia tidak mau sepertinya dia punya masa lalu yang buruk sama temannya
397977 tadi pagi waktu kalian ninggalin aku sendiriian di kelas sam menghampiri aku
397978 yeee ditanya jawabnya malah begitu terus kenapa kamu bisa mengambil kesimpulan dia punya masa lalu yang buruk kalau kamu sendiri tidak tahu apa tujuannya menghampiri kamu
397979 kamu jangan langsung mengambil keputusan seperti itu lex kita kan tidak kenal siapa dia bisa saja dia yang sudah kurang ajar sama teman temannya dan dia hanya membela diri dihadapan kamu
397980 apa kita membantu dia nggak lex aku tidak mau titik ngapain juga membantu orang brengsek seperti dia
397981 berubah kamu jangan mimpi lex orang seperti dia tidak akan berubah sudahlah lex hentikan saja niatmu itu aku tidak akan setuju
397982 aku juga bingung lex mungkin kamu benar tapi romy juga kemungkinan benar
397983 koq kamu seyakin itu sich kita kenal dia baru semalam kamu jangan terlalu berharap lex
397984 rom setiap manusia punya hati dan dengan hati manusia akan berbuat baik sam punya hati
397985 bagiku sam tidak punya hati jadi lebih baik kamu hentikan niat kamu untuk membantu dia usahamu hanya akan terbuang sia sia
397986 ya sudahlah daripada kalian berdebat terus hanya karena sam lebih baik kita main basket sudah lama kita tidak memainkannya
397987 teman teman romy tidak ikut pa dan romy pergi kemana papa sama mama tidak perlu tahu romy sudah dewasa jadi terserah mau pergi kemana
397988 romy kamu jangan ngomong begitu mama sama papa sayang sama kamu kalau kamu keluar jangan lupa bilang sama mama dan papa
397989 untuk apa romy harus bilang ma mama sendiri yang bilang romy sudah dewasa ya sudah
397990 sudah pa mungkin romy masih marah karena papa sudah menamparnya malam kemarin
397991 pa mungkin kita juga salah kita harusnya memberi perhatian yang lebih
397992 ya sudah mama perhatikan dia dan ajari supaya bersikap sopan dan tahu berterima kasih sama orangtua ajari dia supaya tidak banyak menuntut
397993 jangan cuma mama dong pa papa juga harus ikut memberi perhatian sama dia dia kan anak kita satu satunya
397994 rom tante bilang tadi malam kamu keluar kamu pergi kemana
397995 kenapa kamu nggak bilang sama kita kita kita bertiga kan bisa nemanin kamu
397996 yah aku nggak mau kalian tambah capek cuma buat nemanin aku beli buku kalian kan capek habis main basket
397997 kenapa sekarang kamu mikirin hal kayak gitu bukankah selama ini kita sering keluar walaupun baru habis main basket atau apapun itu
397998 apa aku salah aku cuma nggak mau bikin kalian capek cuma buat nemanin aku
397999 nggak ada yang bagus atau karena kamu memang nggak doyan baca buku
398000 yah karena kamu kelihatan aneh kamu pergi tanpa bilang bilang sama kita dan kamu pergi ke tempat yang paling kamu nggak suka toko buku selama ini yang lebih suka baca buku cuma ely atau alexa
398001 heh jams setiap orang bisa berubah aku pergi ke toko buku harusnya kamu bersyukur itu artinya aku mulai suka baca buku bukannya malah memojokkan aku dengan kecurigaanmu itu
398002 sudah lex apa pedulimu sich lebih baik kita ke perustakaan masih banyak waktu sebelum bel kita nyari buku baru disana
398003 iya lex james benar kita nyari buku aja siapa tahu ada buku bagus
398004 bagus mungkin kamu lebih memilih buat ngurusin hal yang nggak penting itu silahkan tapi aku yakin kamu tidak akan pernah berhasil
398005 aku nggak tahu rom aku nggak ikut karena aku malas aku nggak punya maksud seperti yang kamu tuduh
398006 terserah dech kamu mau ngaku atau tidak tapi aku tahu kenapa kamu nggak mau ikut ke perpustakaan
398007 koq malah bertengkar sich rom kenapa kamu curigaan mulu sama alexa
398008 aku sudah minta maaf rom kenapa kamu jadi aneh begitu sich
398009 yang aneh itu bukan aku tapi alexa untuk apa sekarang dia ngotot buat ngurusin hal yang nggak penting itu bukankah kemarin dia sudah bilang kalau dia tidak akan ikut campur lagi sama masalah orang
398010 dan alexa tidak bilang kalau dia bakal ngurusin urusan orang rom dia nggak ikut ke perpustakaan karena malas apa kamu tidak dengar
398011 jadi yang kamu maksud teman begitu kalau memang tidak cocok untuk apa masih bertahan
398012 kadang orang yang kita percaya pun bisa jadi musuh yang menikam diam diam dari belakang
398013 ketiga sahabat aku bukan orang seperti itu kamu salah kalau menilai semua orang itu sama
398014 apa aku pernah bilang kalau semua orang sama aku kan cuma bilang kalau seorang sahabat juga bisa menjadi musuh bebuyutan apa kamu tahu mempertahankan persahabatan tidak semudah mencarinya sedikit berbuat salah bisa bberakibat buruk
398015 heh aku kan sudah bilang mereka bukan orang seperti itu jangan pernah menilai mereka seperti itu aku lebih tahu siapa mereka
398016 tapi tidak semuanya kan kamu tidak tahu apa yang ada dalam pikiran mereka
398017 kalau begitu untuk apa kamu bicara kamu pikir aku bakal takut sama ocehanmu itu
398018 aku kan sudah bilang aku tidak akan takut aku sudah mengenal mereka sejak kecil
398019 orang tua yang sudah melahirkan anaknya saja belum tentu tahu siapa anaknya bagaimana pikirannya dan bagaimana kelakuannya
398020 heh sebenarnya apa yang kamu mau kamu mau merusak persahabatn aku sama mereka
398021 memang iya kan kamu cuma bisa bikin onar di sekolah ini semua tahu itu dan mungkin juga kamu seorang profokator yang ingin merusak persahabatan orang
398022 terserah kamu sajalah aku juga nggak keberatan mau menuduh aku profokator bajingan brengsek atau apalah terserah kamu saja memang begitulah aku adanya aku bukan kamu yang berani menasehati orang sementara kamu tidak melakukannya
398023 kalau mau marah marah saja nggak baik memendam amarah aku takut amarah itu membuat kamu ingat terus sama aku
398024 apa kamu bisa hidup tenang dengan membuat semua orang gondok kalau saja aku bukan ketua kelas aku akan menghajar kamu
398025 hebat ternyata kamu bisa juga menutupi rasa takutmu itu tidak heran kalau kamu dituduh suka nekat
398026 yah karena ibu ingin tahu siapa diantara kalian yang tidak belajar tadi malam soal yang ibu berikan sengaja ibu ambil dari pokok bahasan kita semalam jadi ibu yakin semuanya pasti bisa mengerjakannya
398027 okey kalau begitu ujian kita mulai alexa kamu maju kedepan
398028 okey kalian kerjakan mulai dari sekarang jangan sampai ada yang ketahuan menyontek ingat siapa yang nilainya di bawah angka tujuh akan ibu beri hukuman
398029 begitu ya maaf ibu lupa ya sudah alexa tolong kumpulkan semua buku pr kalian
398030 besok pagi jam pertama ibu yang masuk hasil jawabannya akan ibu bagi besok ingat bagi yang nilainya di bawah tujuh akan ibu beri hukuman
398031 sekarang kalian boleh istirahat alexa tolong bantu ibu membawa buku buku ini ke kantor
398032 hai lex sapa seorang cowok tiba tiba alexa terkejut melihat segerombolan cowok yang sudah menghadang langkahnya
398033 yah kalau misalkan gio minta balik lagi kamu masih mau nerima nggak
398034 kalau sampai dia melakukannya lagi aku akan menghajarnya sampai babak belur dan aku tidak peduli walaupun kamu tidak setuju
398035 enak saja kamu jangan samain aku kayak dia dia itu orang yang nggak punya hati
398036 sudahlah lex mau sampai kapan kamu terus terusan belain dia kalau dia memang punya hati mana mungkin dia tega menghajar anak anak di sekolah ini
398037 aku heran sama kamu apa dia memelet kamu sampai segitunya belain dia
398038 rom dia sama sekali tidak memelet aku aku berpikir secara rasional setiap manusia pasti punya hati
398039 kalau kamu berpikir rasional kamu pasti bisa membedakan mana manusia yang punya hati atau nggak kalau dia punya hati mana mungkin tiap hari bikin masalah dan bikin keributan di sekolah ini
398040 mm iya soalnya aku sudah ada rencana keluar sama mama
398041 iya tapi hari ini papa sendirian yang ngurusin kantor kata mama aku bakal diajak jalan jalan berdua saja
398042 ya sudah nggak apa apa yang penting kamu bisa bersenang senang sama tante iya kan
398043 aku juga nggak tahu soalnya mama mau bikin kejutan sama aku yah kalian kan tahu sendiri mama udah lama nggak pernah ngajak aku jalan jalan besok dech aku cerita sama kalian
398044 okey dech besok kita tunggu semoga acara jalan jalan kamu sama tante lancar ya
398045 kalian juga hm kalian pergi kemana ke mall atau bioskop
398046 maafkan aku sobat aku tidak pergi sama mama aku hanya tidak ingin kalian jadi sedih gara gara aku mana mungkin mama punya waktu untuk nemanin aku mama sama papa cuma mikirin pekerjaannya selama ini kalian sudah banyak menghibur disaat aku sedih dan aku tidak mau membuat kalian sedih lagi hanya karena mendengar semua yang kurasakan di rumah aku sudah banyak berbohong karena sebenarnya aku tidak mendapatkan kasih sayang seperti yang kalian dapatkan dari o om dan tante dan aku sudah tidak layak lagi menjadi sahabat kalian aku sudah ingkar sama janji yang kita buat dulu sobat maafkan aku karena mulai hari ini aku akan menghindari kalian aku tidak layak jadi sahabat yang baik buat kalian
398047 seperti pesan ibu semalam hari ini akan ibu bagikan hasil ujian kalian dan bagi siapa yang nilainya di bawah angka tujuh siap siap saja menerima hukuman dari ibu
398048 tolong bagikan kertas kertas ini sesuai nama yang tercantum disana
398049 aku pikir cowok seperti kamu nggak bakal bisa dapat nilai sebagus ini
398050 gila aku dapat nilai enam mampus aku bakal kena hukum sama guru sam bakal ngetawain aku lagi padahal aku baru saja meledek dia aduuhh malu banget
398051 okey yang merasa nilainya dibawah angka tujuh harap maju ke depan
398052 coba kalian lihat sam yang masih belum lama di sekolah ini bisa mendapat nilai paling tinggi di kelas ini sedangkan james romy dan ely yang biasanya mendapat nilai paling tinggi sekarang ada di bawah sam dan yang lebih membuat ibu heran alexa ketua di kelas ini malah mendapat nilai paling buruk diantara yang lainnya memalukan sekali
398053 coba jelaskan kepada mereka kenapa hari ini nilai kamu bisa seburuk ini
398054 bagus sangat bagus sekali sebagai ketua kelas yang jadi panutan kamu telah menunjukkan contoh yang baik apa perlu ibu memecat kamu jadi ketua kelas
398055 sekarang sebagai hukuman kamu kerjakan semua soal ujian yang semalam di papan tulis setelah selesai kamu jelaskan hasil jawabanmu kepada teman temanmu
398056 nah buktinya kamu bisa mengerjakan semuanya dengan benar ibu suka itu tapi lain kali kalau terjadi lagi hal seperti ini ibu benar benar akan memecatmu paham
398057 okey sekarang kamu kembali ke kursi dan kita lanjutkan pelajaran kita semalam
398058 aku nggak habis pikir lex emang sewaktu ujian kamu ngapain aja sich sampai sampai nilai kamu enam gitu baru kali ini kamu dapat nilai enam matematika
398059 ya iyalah gara gara dia kita jadi malu sama anak anak sama guru baru kali ini nilai kita ada yang menandingi
398060 tapi jangan salahkan sam dong itu salah kita sendiri kita tidak bisa mendapat nilai yang lebih bagus
398061 alexa benar rom nilai kita nggak bagus sama sekali nggak ada hubungannya sama sam kita jangan menyalahkan dia karena ini memang salah kita sendiri
398062 karena pemikiran kamu salah rom kamu boleh saja benci sama sam tapi bukan berarti seenaknya nyalahin dia begitu
398063 yah dia menghajar anak anak juga kamu bakal belain dia kamu memang sudah di pelet sama dia
398064 rom aku kan sudah bilang dia nggak memelet aku harusnya kamu juga berpikir secara rasional apa pantas kita menyalahkan sam hanya karena nilainya lebih tinggi dari kita nggak kan
398065 sudah sudah apa kalian tidak bosan jadi tontonan anak anak hanya karena memperdebatkan si sam malu kan
398066 ini semua gara gara si sam coba kalau dia tidak ada di sekolah ini semua itu tidak akan terjadi
398067 rom ini semua tidak ada hubungannya sama dia jadi jangan bawa bawa dia dalam masalah kita
398068 aku mengganggu dia karena dia sendiri yang lebih dulu mencari masalah sama aku kalau nggak percaya tanyakan saja dia
398069 apapun alasanmu kamu tidak boleh mengganggu dia kalau kamu masih mengganggu dia aku akan menghajarmu
398070 rom bukan begitu caranya menyelesaikan masalah aku tidak mau kita dipanggil ke kantor bp gara gara berantem
398071 lex kamu harus kejar romy dia benar benar marah sama kamu
398072 apa kamu belum puas membuat persahabatan kami berantakan seperti ini
398073 lex aku sama ely nyusul romy duluan ya nanti kalau masalah kamu sudah selesai sama dia kamu temui kita
398074 apa kamu tidak bisa membiarkan aku dan sahabat sahabatku hidup dengan tenang apa kamu tidak bisa melihat orang lain bahagia apa kamu belum puas melihat bertengkar tiap hari apalagi yang kamu inginkan dari kami
398075 aku tidak pura pura aku tidak tahu apa yang kalian perdebatkan aku datang kesini dan menemuimu hanya untuk minta penjelasan atas apa yang kamu ucapkan tadi pagi
398076 aku tidak peduli masalah apa yang kalian perdebatkan karena aku tidak pernah ikut campur sama masalah kalian
398077 aku kan sudah bilang aku butuh penjelasan atas ucapan kamu tadi pagi di kelas
398078 apa kamu sudah terbiasa untuk bersikap tidak jujur apa jangan jangan kamu sering membohongi sahabat sahabatmu
398079 okey kalau begitu aku harap kamu bisa menjawab pertanyaan aku barusan
398080 cowok seperti aku tidak pantas mendapat nilai yang lebih tinggi iya kan yah maklum aku bukan anak orang kaya dan tidak bisa berpenampilan bagus seperti kalian aku cuma anak jalanan yang tidak pantas mendapat nilai lebih dan aku tidak pantas mendapat pujian orang seperti aku lebih pantas mendapat hinaan dari orang orang seperti kalian itu kan jawaban yang mau kamu katakan baguslah dengan senang hati aku menghargainya
398081 kenapa kamu mau bilang kalau omonganmu tadi pagi tidak ada maksud apa apa
398082 gumam alexa dengan suara bergetar sepertinya ia sedang menyembunyikan rasa takutnya ia tidak ingin cowok itu sampai tahu
398083 nggak ada bedanya kan sama apa yang baru saja aku ucapkan
398084 beda sam aku tidak mengatakan kalau kamu anak jalanan yang tidak pantas mendapat nilai yang bagus
398085 aku tahu kamu memang tidak mengatakan aku anak jalanan yang tidak pantas mendapat nilai bagus tapi intinya sama saja kamu menilai orang dari penampilan luar
398086 okey aku bisa memakluminya karena kamu memang tidak salah aku memang anak yang kurang ajar yang tidak seharuanya mendapat nilai yang bagus tapi ingat jangan melakukan hal yang sama pada orang lain kamu jangan menilai orang lain buruk hanya dengan melihat penampilan luar kamu tahu kenapa karena kamu akan kelihatan jauh lebih buruk daripada orang yang kamu nilai
398087 aku yang munafik atau dia yang munafik kalau dia jahat kenapa harus memberikan aku nasehat seperti itu kalau dia bukan anak yang jahat kenapa ia tega melukai anak anak yang ada di sekolah ini sebenarnya apa yang dia inginkan apa dia setan bertopeng malaikat atau justru malaikat bertopeng setan ha ah dasar cowok aneh
398088 kamu kenapa alexa pulang sekolah tampangnya koq uring uringan gitu kamu ada masalah apalagi
398089 kamu tuh ya dari dulu selalu saja bertengkarnya sama romy apa kalian memang tidak bisa akur
398090 habis romy selalu curiga sama alexa ma padahal alexa tidak bermaksud membuatnya marah
398091 itu kan bukan hal yang aneh lagi bagi kalian romy itu memang gampang marah jadi kamu harusnya pintar pintar menghadapinya jangan sampai ia tersinggung dan marah sama kamu
398092 ma belakangan ini romy kelihatan aneh dia suka marah dan tadi di sekolah dia hampir memukul anak baru itu
398093 hm mungkin romy tidak suka kalau dia menghina kamu itu sebabnya dia marah
398094 tapi romy hendak memukul sam bukan karena sam menghina lexa ma
398095 romy tidak terima kalau nilai kita berempat lebih rendah dari nilai sam romy mau memukul sam tapi alexa tidak membiarkannya dan romy malah marah karena aku tidak membiarkan dia memukul sam dan romy tidak mau bicara sama alexa apalagi buat maafin lexa bagaimana ini ma
398096 ya sudah kamu sudah mengenal romy sejak kecil dan kamu pasti tahu bagaimana cara meenghadapinya jangan pernah membuatnya tersinggung dan hari ini dia tidak bicara sama kamu pasti karena dia masih emosi mama yakin besok hatinya pasti sudah tenang dan amarahnya hilang kamu harus minta maaf sama dia
398097 iya mama yakin romy itu sayang sama kamu dia pasti bisa maafin kamu
398098 moga saja ma lexa juga sayang sama dia james dan ely aku tidak mau gara gara aku persahabatan kami jadi berantakan
398099 iya mama juga selalu berdoa persahabatan kalian tetap baik seperti saudara
398100 aku minta maaf sama kamu aku mengaku salah sama kamu
398101 kalau kamu tidak bisa maafin aku nggak memaksa rom tapi kamu jangan diam begitu
398102 yah apapun alasannya kamu jangan pernah dekat dekat sama sam kita berantem gara gara dia jadi mulai sekarang kamu harus menjauh dari dia
398103 tapi bagaimana mungkin itu terjadi rom aku ketua kelas kamu sendiri pernah menyuruh aku untuk ikut campur sama maslah dia karena aku ketua kelas
398104 kalau kamu tidak mau ya sudah aku juga tidak memaksa kamu untuk menerima syarat itu
398105 okey aku terima syarat dari kamu tapi kamu juga janji satu hal sama aku kamu jangan curigaan sama aku
398106 kenapa ya aku merasa ada yang aneh kenapa aku jadi sedih apa susahnya menerima syarat yang begitu mudah mungkin aku akan lebih baik dengan menerima syarat itu aku tidak perlu lagi buang buang tenaga untuk berantem sama sam dan yang lebih penting aku bisa baik lagi sama romy bukankah sahabat sahabat aku jauh lebih berharga dari siapapun di sekolah ini
398107 baguslah dengan begitu aku tidak perlu lagi menghindar dan takut romy jadi marah tapi koq tumben apa jangan jangan dia bisa tahu soal persyaratan yang diajukan romy ah nggak mungkin banget dia kan bukan peramal tapi selama ini dia selalu saja bisa menebak pikiran aku apa jangan jangan dia bisa membaca pikiranku ah mustahil
398108 oh iya entar sore kita ada pelajaran ekstrakurikuler jangan lupa
398109 oh iya lex aku senang banget hari ini kamu bisa menepati janji kamu
398110 heran untuk apa aku mengganggu dia karena dia sendiri yang cari gara gara dan hari ini dia mencari gara gara
398111 hmm sebenarnya ada apa sam belakangan ini kamu kelihatan sering melamun kamu mikirin apa sich
398112 aku kan sudah bilang apapun yang aku lakukan kamu tidak usah ikut campur
398113 sudahlah aku tidak butuh kata tapi aku butuh kamu diam
398114 apa maksud kamu menyuruh aku untuk melihat mereka aku tidak minta kamu menunjukkannya dan aku tidak mau tahu mereka ada dimana
398115 yah aku cuma ngasih tahu aja dan aku tidak punya maksud apa apa
398116 aku heran apa sebenarnya yang mau kamu tahu dari aku
398117 sam kamu sendiri yang minta aku ikut sama kamu masa aku tidak boleh tahu sedikitpun tentang keluargamu
398118 iya tante nama saya andry tante saya teman sekelasnya sam
398119 oh iya ndry kalau kamu mau minum ambil saja di dapur
398120 mm aku kenal sam setelah pindah ke smu mulia bhakti tante

398356 es ist alles total schnell gegangen beim anbremsen einer kurve bin ich zu weit nach au en gekommen dann bin ich von einer seite auf die andere geknallt ehe mir das heck total ausgebrochen ist und schon waren wir in dem teich drinnen ein saubl der fehler zu dumm ich h tte noch so viel zu testen gehabt
398357 wir haben kurz berlegt wieder an den start zu gehen aber es h tte keinen sinn gemacht da der motor und die gesamte elektronik unter wasser stehen es ist einfach traurig dass wir aus diesem einsatz nicht mehr machen konnten

398377 theres no question that the challenging macroeconomic environment in the u s has made it difficult to grow the top line
398378 the delays in purchases reflect economic anxieties far more than they do competitive positioning
398379 they have a client base largely comprised of telecom government and financial services customers and those segments have really slowed buying
398380 macroeconomic issues are the biggest issues a slowing economy and all the banks going out of business
398381 they have high exposure to legacy unix products that enterprises are moving away from
398382 we now enter yet another year where sun is hoping to grow slightly and expand its margins
398383 its been trying to do that the last three or four years so theres less and less investor confidence in the company
398384 most people buy on price they want to buy from the biggest vendors because they will give them the best deal in a down economy its an even harder sell for sun
398385 they have an expectation that their customers want to put it together and figure out how it works
398386 part of the problem is that they they havent done enough to reach out to the right partners to build an out of the box ecosystem of products they think too much about technology and need to think more about how all those pieces will work together

398388 a lot of courts are not terribly concerned about marijuana
398389 its just not viewed by a lot of people as something as serious as other drugs people view it sort of as a gateway drug
398390 it varies a lot depending on the prosecuting authority and what the local judges will do
398391 well be looking at the legislative calendar and figuring out what looks like the optimum time
398392 were going to be talking with the potential bill sponsors and figuring all that stuff out over the next few months
398393 there is a a totally wrong perception that this is a politically risky issue and its not
398394 penalties vary not just from state to state but also from jurisdiction to jurisdiction or from cop to cop sometimes you get a slap on the wrist sometimes your life is made truly miserable
398395 we say lets get rid of the laws altogether and make this just like alcohol
398396 tax it regulate it and make it available to those of us over 21 responsible users
398397 the districts are drawn in those odd shapes because we were trying to get some kind of economic balance where if a company got a territory they would have to serve people with different economic interests
398398 i think the commission wanted the comfort of big companies
398399 there were only a few companies in the country that had worked with giant cities and the businessmans attitude was that they were the guys who should do it for us
398400 rcn wasnt meeting the requirements of their franchise agreement so we worked out a settlement agreement with them to resolve that issue
398401 it wasnt an ideal situation due to their financial circumstances they simply werent able to continue into area two
398402 a five year build schedule is pretty aggressive when youre talking about a build out and trying to build a customer base in order to pay for the continued build
398403 so thats why you dont see too much franchise build out actually happening
398404 if the city were to have a smaller area and if we were to build in it that would probably be easier for us to look at and consider
398405 there is an exception for the antitrust laws for government action
398406 as long as a government entity is sufficiently clear that it wants to displace competition with some kind of regulation and it actively supervises the companies then its legal under the antitrust laws
398407 if the government wants to do something as long as theyre sufficiently clear about it theyre free to
398408 you can have a debate about whether its a good idea and then the people should do something electorally if theyre dissatisfied
398409 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
398410 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they ave retained the hunger they need to succeed then we will look forward phughes699

398415 weve grown up with jenny shes our family she deserves better than getting sent to a drive through tourist attraction in mexico
398416 jennys situation is of great concern to many people i represent
398417 this is not an indictment of the zoo in mexico but jenny deserves to be somewhere she will be happy
398418 we know she is a nervous elephant and with protected contact she can approach people if she wants to and we can monitor her stress levels easily without anyone getting hurt or killed
398419 these animals need our help to protect their natural habitat as well as facilitate conservation programs throughout the country that are helping new generations of wildlife stewards and conservationists

398421 alaskans are calling for a complete and fair investigation into why walt monegan was fired and if it had anything to do with trooper mike wooten
398422 steve branchflower is a highly respected prosecutor and public servant
398423 if there were wrongs committed he will find them if there were not he has the professional experience and good judgment to say so
398424 the project manager sen french already elevated this by publicly suggesting impeachment before the senate laid out any rules or an investigator was named
398425 publicly elevating this to impeachment raises doubts as to how fair a process some senators may intend for this to be
398426 to investigate the circumstances and events surrounding the termination of former public safety commissioner monegan and potential abuses of power and or improper actions by members of the executive branch
398427 we want to make sure this process is fair and theres no conflict of interest
398428 i think everybody wants this to be done in a timely manner including the governor
398429 one of the reasons we are doing this isnt to point a finger its to blow a cloud away and the sooner you blow that cloud away the better it is for the department the governor and alaskans
398430 i am so scared out of my mind i can hardly stand it
398431 then he calmed down and it was like this is it
398432 because we want the heart to be a little bit bigger
398433 shawn nodded yes and the doctor went crazy like carlton on fresh prince of bel air
398434 he woke up fine hes awake hes talking so far everything is going well
398435 ive heard of people who have to make really hard choices when it come to paying for gas paying for rent and paying for groceries
398436 i dont make very much its just not enough theres not enough hours
398437 i had to live there because there wasnt no other alternatives
398438 i was just with the people i was with and it was all good
398439 its weird because i dont have a house to live in
398440 i know some now that couch surf just surf around
398441 its like a rotating thing back and forth back and forth
398442 if we got youth to 18 that was an enormous accomplishment and that in and of itself was a good thing
398443 if youre a single person and youre working 40 hours a week at minimum wage youre probably not going to be able to afford a one bedroom apartment in anchorage without some kind of assistance
398444 when youth that are just out of custody are competing with people who have had a job for awhile and have a credit history theyre just going to get tagged
398445 theres not a lot of spare housing out there and the transition programs are very limited
398446 i think its the influx of the kids who come here because theres a limited economic base in their community
398447 and they come here and it all looks very attainable but its so far from an easy grasp
398448 i was rooming with somebody when i first moved here and that still wasnt covering living expenses
398449 i went home because i couldnt afford rent anymore and the hours of work wasnt doing too much
398450 we are all smiles and we are full of gratitude for our good lawmakers making a very very wise decision for alaska
398451 theyve been drawn to a conclusion i dont agree with
398452 we might hit a gas line and we might hit dust
398453 i did not hear a clear endorsement of this concept
398454 we do business with those folks each and every day
398455 we hope the state will give us a level playing field on getting permits

398459 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
398460 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
398461 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore he has consistently opposed it he has opposed nuclear power he has opposed reprocessing he has opposed storage
398462 everybody should have the same choice cindy and i and sen obama did
398463 my opponent talks a great deal about hope and change and education is as good a test as any of his seriousness
398464 if sen obama continues to defer to the teachers unions instead of committing to real reform then he should start looking for new slogans
398465 if theres one thing he always delivers its a great speech
398466 but i hope youll listen carefully because his ideas are not always as impressive as his rhetoric
398467 this is the first study to demonstrate an independent association between all cause mortality and sleep apnea in a community based study
398468 the size of the increased mortality risk was surprisingly large
398469 in our particular study a six fold increase means that having significant sleep apnea at age 40 gives you about the same mortality risk as somebody aged 57 who doesnt have sleep apnea
398470 our findings remove any reasonable doubt that sleep apnea is a fatal disease
398471 people who have or suspect that they have sleep apnea should consult their physicians about diagnosis and treatment options

398490 we are honored to have him here he is very special
398491 first i tell them about how all the players came up to me and first said how much theyre indebted to the soldiers and marines in iraq they realize what theyre giving up so they can do what theyre doing here which is play professional football i send that message back to them
398492 its amazing how much it means to them when youre in a day to day grind and you come back from that day and track your football team whoever it might be its pretty passionate over there last year was a good year for me over in iraq and this year is going to be better
398493 coughlin was understanding he has kids and grandkids this is my first child im really grateful he does understand its huge for me for my son to be proud of his father since i didnt have one
398494 when we are in camp the most important thing we do is prepare for football however the real world certainly continues to exist for all of us beyond this camp
398495 the birth of a child is a special once in a lifetime experience
398496 i have my fathers last name but i never met my father
398497 my grandfather did a lot to raise me we lived in a house he owned in concord calif i felt like i owed it to him i dont carry his name on my birth certificate but its with me
398498 i wasnt a bastard child but all my friends had dads i didnt have a dad
398499 my mother didnt remarry until i was done with college knowing how he treated my mom with his last name and the kind of man he was to leave us because im having a kid i want my son to be proud he has my last name
398500 he has tremendous energy and great desire to be a very good football player
398501 he is smart and he works hard he has a football mentality he has a lot of plusses
398502 the more rest the better hell be hell throw two bullpen sessions in the meantime he should be fine after that
398503 a lot of times the best trades that you make are the ones that you didnt make
398504 going through the season last year and then watching film on it just shows you that i was running out there with my head cut off
398505 now i understand the defensive schemes more i understand what im supposed to do at a certain time i think its key to know that
398506 last year i knew a couple of things in the playbook
398507 darrelle really did have a nice season last year for such a young guy
398508 and hes responded in ways as a coach youre always excited to see hes taken this extra time that he didnt have last year and taken to heart the concept of going out each day and working on something some kind of weakness and getting that better
398509 and it may not be a glaring weakness it may be something that you want to refine training his body getting his footwork as solid as it can be against a lot of different looks
398510 and hes always challenging guys hes challenging receivers he wants to go against the toughest guy all the time the toughest route all the time put himself in those hard situations so that when he faces them in a game theyre not as hard hes seen it and he understands how to deal with it
398511 im going to continue to go to him because that is his job
398512 mo is the greatest closer of all time and it just didnt work tonight
398513 if we cant beat these good teams we dont get to the playoffs if we cant beat these good teams
398514 it came down to a battle of the bullpens and they beat us
398515 this has not been a good homestand for us and we have to bounce back today
398516 renault a plus respect le r glement que les autres
398517 this is a bit bittersweet being the last old timers day at yankee stadium and its aug 2 which is the day of my husbands accident
398518 but to be with the people who loved him and to share the feeling we all have thats the amazing thing about coming back to new york
398519 there wasnt a greater competitor or a greater friend or a greater teammate
398520 and thurman with the anniversary today of his death its going to be a great weekend its going to be emotional
398521 its obviously very important to me what happens to that locker and im so grateful to mr steinbrenner for the tribute to thurman leaving it empty for 29 years
398522 we had opportunities to win the game and did not take advantage of it situationally
398523 now that ive got my feet wet a little bit maybe everything will come a little bit smoother than it did tonight
398524 occorre coltivare un dovere della memoria che si traduca in una rinnovata ampia assunzione di responsabilita per la difesa dei valori di democrazia liberta e giustizia come fondamento del nostro patto costituzionale e garanzia irrinunciabile di crescita politica culturale e sociale anche per le nuove generazioni
398525 sono trascorsi ventotto anni dalla strage che il 2 agosto 1980 provoco alla stazione di bologna la morte di ottantacinque persone e il ferimento di oltre duecento si legge nel messaggio di napolitano le immagini di quel crimine cosi barbaro e vile che scosse e scuote tuttora nel profondo la coscienza degli italiani rimangono impresse in modo indelebile nella memoria dellintero paese
398526 si e cosi voluto innanzitutto da parte del parlamento esprimere un segno di riconoscenza e di omaggio delle istituzioni repubblicane e della nazione tutta nei confronti di coloro che hanno pagato con la vita la violenza cieca e disumana di quegli anni
398527 i think ive faced him 30 to 40 times and that is the first time he threw me a changeup
398528 regardless of whos pitching or how well theyre pitching were better than no runs
398529 he threw the ball as good as any pitcher has thrown against us all year
398530 when you have an ultimate goal of being here and you feel like youre ready that drags on you
398531 the guys that are here have done an awesome job
398532 i wouldnt have been surprised if they optioned me to the minor leagues because the guys here were doing so well
398533 internet explorer cannot open the site and the operation is aborted
398534 growing up in the late 70s in these small towns in canada you really had to search for anything different in music so i was constantly trying to find new things
398535 the first things that made a big impression early on were talking heads remain in light kraftwerks man machine plus b52s and gary numan this was around 1980 to 1981
398536 also i was still into disco which i kept a secret as things were very anti disco at that time
398537 after that around 1982 i was into all the english synthesizer music and early hip hop
398538 then in 1984 i discovered mojos show in detroit so that got me into newkleus
398539 it was all made with cheap synthesizers and drum machines i couldnt afford to buy much gear at that time
398540 after that i was listening and being influenced by everything i could get my hands on like new york hip hop bdp epmd just ice marley marl audio two spoonie gee soul james brown esg zapp parliament and funkadelic bt express etc then early house jm silk phuture chip e lil louis etc and also reich glass tangerine dream brian eno and more oddball things like negativland test department cabaret voltaire tackhead adrian sherwood productions
398541 i even bought skinny puppys first release on cassette before they got signed
398542 this was all around 86 i think i had also started trying to make hip hop
398543 the guys i produced opened for public enemy when they came to town
398544 i was also doing these home made cassettes and selling them in toronto record stores which were experimental ideas with hip hop and house beats
398545 i did one release that was an audio homage to marshall mcluhan
398546 around this time i started traveling to new york city and buffalo ny for records because it was impossible to find what i wanted in canada
398547 i would do things like go and walk around the south bronx to see what the rappers were talking about i was very naive at the time
398548 but once i got the house bug i totally went into that direction as far as production is concerned
398549 regardless of who is pitching or how well they are pitching we are better than no runs
398550 in maybe 30 40 times i have faced him including spring training hes never thrown me a changeup
398551 a guy like santana you want to get to him early but we werent able to do it
398552 they have good pitching those guys are filthy there is a reason they have the best record in baseball they have good pitching and they dont make many mistakes
398553 i am still not 100 where i want my mechanics to be but i gave them a chance to win we just came up on the short end of the stick
398554 its always important to bounce back after a poor performance but we didnt win today its a really bitter pill to swallow
398555 it was going north south instead of east west when its going side to side is when im going to get hit hard
398556 ah definitely i mean i couldnt have done as well
398557 its a team thing i dont strike a lot of people out i throw the ball over the plate those guys know that and they make the plays and make my life a lot easier they gave me the chance to stay out there

398563 i know the effort of the people that are in the front office trying to do whats best not only for the team but for the organization at this point
398564 i think they take all those things into consideration i dont have any problem with that ive been on teams where people hold you hostage because you are where you are and you have what you have you just have to be careful a lot of times they say the best trades that you make are the ones you didnt make
398565 i dont like to bring a kid if the matchup is not favorable for him id like to get something that appears favorable its still the major leagues dont get me wrong anybody can look favorable but it can be dangerous because you are in the major leagues
398566 i love to look at young players no question about that i enjoy it i would like that but at the same time there has to be a real good chance to feel like we could win
398567 i felt good going back out there for the second inning tonight
398568 unfortunately i wasnt able to make the adjustments the ball was running balls that would normally sink were staying up and balls that usually stay true were running away
398569 he gives us our best shot to keep the game where it is right now
398570 we had opportunities to win the game and did not take advantage
398571 i couldnt believe they didnt score we were all saying boy that was a huge job so it went from were in trouble to boy were probably going to win we got a good chance to win this game were tied and we have home field advantage and everything else
398572 not pitching in 20 days made me lose a little bit of the touch for the pitches the location once you let it go theres no way to pull it back

398690 the notion of blaming ones leader for the death of a family or community member from a terrorist attack or war might seem odd at first but a personal tie to a victim converts abstract distant costs of international violence into a vivid personal and profoundly emotional experience one that has clear strong and consistent political implications
398691 methadone kills sensitive leukemia cells and also breaks treatment resistance but without any toxic effects on non leukemic blood cells
398692 we find this very exciting because once conventional treatments have failed a patient which occurs in old and also in young patients they have no other options
398693 the issue of sexual harassment has become less taboo recently in the egyptian media within academic circles and has even become a part of daily discourse among women in egyptian society regardless of social or economic status or political belief
398694 men and women are getting married later so obviously men and women are both sexually frustrated but women have no way of showing their sexual frustration
398695 a combination of religion and politics tells young men and women that unless a woman is covered up she is fair game and now men enact their sexual frustration on women without any sense of shame
398696 i feel confident about maintaining the performance we have i look back and see that i have six podiums in ten races i have had three bad races and i should be further in front
398697 we have seen bits of the real lewis hamilton the 100 per cent lewis and when i am 100 per cent no one can touch us

398699 we have evidence to suggest cr uptake into muscles in copd patients but are unable to explain why an increase in muscle cr did not enhance training
398700 the most likely explanation is that any benefits of creatine have been submerged by the large training effect of physical training alone

398704 karadzic indicted for genocide and war crimes was under the us protection until 2000 when the cia intercepted his telephone conversation that clearly proved he personally chaired a meeting of his old political party
398705 im not sure there was a written document confirming so but i do have holbrookes admission of verbal guarantees given to karadzic from the highest level of the us
398706 during the year 2000 at the time of the november general elections in bosnia the cia learned that karadzic was still leading the sds the serbian democratic party founded by karadzic despite their deal that he was not to interfere in political life
398707 in 2000 there was a sds meeting in the eastern bosnian town of bijeljina chaired personally by karadzic he was providing instructions to members and the leadership who to be replaced and who to be appointed to which position
398708 in america they went crazy realizing karadzic was making a fool of them
398709 the americans and cia then withdrew the informal protection enjoyed by karadzic

398711 there are british passport holders who live in the u k who are being found in places like kandahar
398712 while my troops have not actually found british passports on enemy dead there has been a suspicion that with the high number of taliban casualties they have needed to recruit a lot of foreign fighters and some of these are likely to be of british muslim descent

398723 the police wouldnt go into this area neither would the iraqi army

398725 there are 35 year olds here who have never worked in their lives they are a huge poaching field for anyone who comes in with a fistful of dollars

398784 strange sounds were carried on the wind during the night shouting and the crash of broken glass
398785 in a crush of time and extremity the film stars home was carefully rearranged telephone records were seized papers and notes were destroyed and a frantic phone call was placed to the white house
398786 newcomb said that when she left on saturday nothing indicated the impending tragedy
398787 searching through the sparsely furnished house which seemed rather small and inelegant for the house of a film star he found murray in the service porch off the kitchen where both the washer and dryer were running clemmons thought it odd that the housekeeper was doing laundry in the middle of the night while her employer lay dead in the bedroom
398788 murray admitted to clemmons that she packed her things before calling the police called the interior decorator to fix a broken window and did marilyn monroes laundry
398789 greenson monroes psychiatrist stated that monroe was found clutching a phone probably trying to call for help
398790 an array of specimen jars had been neatly arranged on a cart beside the embalming table name and case number tags were on each jar monroes name had already been written on the embalmers tags
398791 if monroe had swallowed as many as forty or more capsules of nembutal as had been estimated evidence of yellow dye should have been found in the digestive tract especially in an empty stomach
398792 clemmons noted there being no drinking glass in the room and wondered how she swallowed the nembutal
398793 in one of the police photos there appears to be a water glass next to the bed
398794 this initial examination was part of a file that disappeared as the case began to expand
398795 for that to happen someone had to have called the mortuary and specifically asked for someone to come and pick up the body
398796 two of the most important people arriving in a probable suicide verdict were greenson and miner and both had changed their opinions
398797 shortly before midnight a dark mercedes sped east on olympic boulevard in beverly hills
398798 elizabeth pollard the neighbor directly across the cul de sac told bob slatzer a man who claims to be monroes ex husband that on the evening of saturday august 4

398800 meanwhile in los angeles reporter joe hyams learned that lawfords neighbors were upset that a helicopter had touched down on the santa monica shore behind the lawfords residence in the early hours of sunday morning august 5 blowing sand into their swimming pools
398801 according to miner they had met for several hours during which greenson discussed not only marilyns habits but also the private confidences she shared with her psychiatrist
398802 otash described a struggle in the monroe bedroom and kennedy yelling where is it where the hell is it i have to have it my family will pay you for it at the conclusion of the struggle otash heard physical blows and a door slamming
398803 nobody but i am so angry i may just call a press conference and show it to the whole world and let everybody know what the kennedys are really like
398804 said that on the night she died her file cabinet was broken into and many of its contents were removed
398805 mr and mrs abe landau who lived to the immediate west of marilyn monroe had returned home from a dinner party late saturday evening and had seen an ambulance and a police car parked in the cul de sac in front of the film stars residence near midnight neighbors heard a helicopter overhead
398806 bobby kennedy was here and he threatened me screamed at me and pushed me around
398807 now she was afraid and felt she was in terrible danger
398808 shes ranting and raving im concerned about her and what may come out of this
398809 for robert kennedy those night hours and the days that followed must have been the most harrowing of his life
398810 when deborah gould asked her ex husband peter lawford how marilyn had died he said marilyn took her last big enema
398811 the loved ones involved according to gould were the kennedy brothers thats where peters role came in
398812 to cover up all the dirty work and take care of everything
398813 according to coroners aide lionel grandison curphey coroner was actually covering up the case of monroes death as i analyze my participation my conversations with other staff members and the thing ive seen theres no doubt in my mind that the marilyn monroe case as we know it now is not the true case some very sensitive areas have been covered up evidence was suppressed paperwork was taken barclay 8 from the files and people who have knowledge of what happened have not been listened to or sought out grandison also discovered that someone in the department was removing and rewriting key material from the monroe file
398814 in 1962 chief parker took the file to show someone in washington
398815 correspondence between parker and rfk in the kennedy library reveals that parker met with kennedy on december 12 at the park university motel in college park md for a mutual matter of interest
398816 it was captain james hamilton who confiscated marilyn monroes phone records and it was captain james hamilton who directed the cover up of information relating to the circumstances of marilyn monroes death
398817 proses penyelidikan masih berlangsung dan yang bersangkutan sudah diperiksa dua kali yaitu pertama mapolwil cirebon dan kedua di hotel apita cirebon kita tunggu saja hasilnya
398818 dia hanya minta maaf jika apa yang dilakukan itu dianggap salah tetapi kronologis kasusnya saya sendiri tidak tahu persis mungkin kapolres cirebon yang lebih tahu
398819 saya tidak bisa menindak kompol nurhadi karena yang bersangkutan sudah pindah ke polda jabar jadi ada tim sendiri yang mengusut kasus itu
398820 jika korban sudah mendapat gantirugi dari asuransi maka kendaraan yang ditemukan menjadi hak asuransi sehingga tinggal diurus untuk mengaktifkan surat surat kendaraan termasuk pembayaran pajak

398851 undeniably low maternal vitamin d affects the way the brain develops
398852 over the past four years weve been able to show that low vitamin d intake in animals during pregnancy results in offspring with brain abnormalities similar to those seen in patients with schizophrenia
398853 the danes are only able to give us 1 6 microlitres of plasma so weve had to come up with a method of determining the vitamin d levels in that tiny amount of blood
398854 in collaboration with alun jones at the institute of molecular bioscience weve developed a way to easily measure low levels of vitamin d using mass spectrometry
398855 if we establish the link in this huge patient cohort we will be able to show that having low maternal vitamin d does not necessarily mean a child is going to develop schizophrenia but if a child has a particularly vulnerable genome the low maternal vitamin d may be the environmental trigger

398868 there is serious concern that the united states has taken this step with the intention to create precedence and pave the way for israel to continue its clandestine weapon activities
398869 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat
398870 whenever the enemies have failed against this nation they have tried to make excuses but the iranian nation will stand against them with its power

398934 the main reason for their enmity with this nation in the past 30 years is that they want to force the iranian nation to retreat

399009 we had heard rumblings that new figures were going to be released but no one would tell us anything
399010 however we sort of expected it weve seen 20 new clients since january which is a lot for our small agency
399011 what concerns us most is that much of this group is made up of young people in their 20s and 30s
399012 theyre people who either dont remember what was going on in the 80s or think that with all the medications available now its no big deal to contract hiv that its like having asthma
399013 we need to get back to doing education in the schools which we havent been doing for the past few years
399014 weve seen a loss of funding for education and when hiv aids is discussed in the classroom it is lumped in with other sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea or syphilis which are curable
399015 it does not allow for the best quality of life
399016 if we dont get a handle on this now it just will spiral into a situation that is much worse than it already is
399017 the hiv epidemic in the u s continues to spread and at a rate greater than was previously thought
399018 the real measure of political leaders and the american people is if this bad news spurs good action the establishment of a comprehensive and accountable national aids strategy that will eliminate barriers to effective prevention generate adequate resources and hold our government accountable for ending this epidemic
399019 the horse has got a leg and a half between two holes in the floor its eight feet underneath
399020 it basically was straddling this support beam its legs dangling
399021 because it fell in the corner we had to take part of the stall wall apart
399022 somewhere along the line the vet showed up and gave it a sedative so it wouldnt hurt itself
399023 we pushed it up enough to get a plank under its butt
399024 im feeling that one pieces are a lot sexier than the two pieces
399025 theres a war economic downturn and a general malaise if not depression in the air but
399026 theres nothing like a beautiful glamorous woman in a swimsuit to take your mind off your woes
399027 its kind of marilyn if you think about it in some like it hot the white ruched dress here we have it in coral
399028 ever since i had my baby ive started wearing one pieces and i had never really worn one before
399029 but once youre moving around much more you want to keep your parts all tucked in i think theyre supportive and sexy and there are a lot of pretty options
399030 youre not seeing the low low low pants even the girls who youd say are walking around naked arent wearing them
399031 i think its how fashion is moving its more about the detail and the trim and less about the skin
399032 herbie hancock was the step after bud powell and thelonious monk and i havent heard anybody yet who has come after him
399033 use your talent why produce something thats nothing but pain when you can produce joy for someone
399034 get help stay in rehab until youre all better and make sure you dont have to go back again
399035 i dont even know where to start with that girl take it easy poor girl
399036 stop with the drugs and whatever else youre doing and be a role model go to rehab and write a song
399037 she needs serious help to get straight she could be really successful and people look up to her get your act together and believe in yourself
399038 if you have ever delved into the medicare system you know that its very complicated
399039 unless you study the details and the fine print you might not know about certain benefits such as this part b payment mandate
399040 while the rule itself has not changed the cms discovered that many folks entitled to this benefit were not using it
399041 thats why they recently reminded the states about the plan
399042 obviously the weight of the tree leaning exceeded the strength of the roots luckily there was no real damage
399043 its been there a long time its amazing its been able to survive in this environment for so long
399044 it is just a blessing that it happened at this time of day
399045 obviously were glad no one was hurt its always sad when a big old tree comes down but i guess nature knows when its time
399046 the southbound vehicle veered into the wrong lane and when the northbound vehicle realized the jeep would not correct itself the beetle swerved into the other lane to avoid being hit
399047 im very excited to be involved with the do something 101 campaign and to help motivate teens to get involved
399048 there are so many kids in america that need school supplies that dont have them and all somebody has to do is donate its so easy
399049 as a benefactor of this program we will receive periodic shipments of school supplies from our local staples stores we will also receive staples gift cards based on the funds raised from local staples customers following the campaign
399050 we plan on using the supplies for our members that are in need of school supplies for the upcoming school year we will also have some of
399051 we would collaborate with them in supplying families that need assistance with school supplies
399052 the pettengill house does a collection for new backpacks for families in need of these items
399053 im thankful for all the help we received without it things would be devastating
399054 i didnt really think anything of it when he went overseas
399055 but the army told us wives they would be different when they returned
399056 we were there to support each other and if we had questions have someone to talk with
399057 it makes them very self conscious and not trusting of people
399058 he started screaming in our bed something about get down incoming guns yes sir heard roger it was frightening i was thinking what happens if he starts swinging i got out of bed and slept on the couch he didnt take offense to it it takes them a while to get back into the rhythm of being a civilian again were still not there
399059 he was easygoing about talking to people now he was not social and was paranoid he thought there were people following him hed ask what is that black box on the road or why did you ask me that the military expects them to turn that switch were waiting at home doing it all ourselves and they come home and add more stress its like who is this guy the kids dont know who he is holy mackerel they come back so different
399060 im supposed to understand their feelings but it doesnt seem like they understand me
399061 when we had the veterans returning party there were no balloons because we had been warned that if even one popped it could set them off
399062 a neighbor shot off fireworks and it was pretty loud a trigger for paul
399063 i ran around the house and hes lying with his face in the ground patting the grass
399064 the next year on the fourth of july neighbors in dover were setting them fireworks off and my husband was on the floor trying to get under the bed
399065 we ended up losing our duplex and with four kids moved to the projects in dover
399066 my two oldest got out of control hanging with the wrong crowd
399067 i called the manchester v a and explained the paranoia the high anxiety he was either not sleeping for days or just sleeping and not changing clothes they said admit him and he stayed two months they put him on meds and counseled him
399068 i headed to hanscom air force base and asked if i could stay in their lodging
399069 save said they were looking for people to start a support group through them and asked if i were interested yeah i was interested
399070 they asked no questions and even agreed to shut down a few hours once a month so thered be no gunshots
399071 cigarette butts are a huge problem no way to argue that
399072 people consider them easy to throw down because they are small and likely seem harmless
399073 they are a huge problem and add up to enormous quantities of waste on public and private beaches
399074 the majority of people dont even associate it with trash
399075 cigarette smokers no matter where they are think that they can just flick it
399076 what prompted me to sell was my need to do more international service and the fact that i was getting tired and not paying as much attention as i should have been to the business
399077 coming to work every day was a joy but it was a joy because i wasnt working hard enough
399078 my life has been divided into score 20 year periods
399079 the first 20 years i spent growing up the second 20 were spent as a tobacconist and the third will be spent in international service
399080 i think the planning board has made the right decision concerning new developments in town
399081 this was the moment when the rise in the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal
399082 spending all of his time and the powerful platform he has on these sorts of juvenile antics
399083 i dont think our campaign isnt negative in the slightest
399084 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it well continue to fight and scrap all the way to november 4
399085 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
399086 the whole industry has been doing really quite well but it has grown so fast over the last couple of years that returns are starting to drop pretty sharply
399087 all of a sudden therell just be too many blueberries one year and they wont be worth anything
399088 weve had the best of both worlds increasing supply and increasing pricing really driven by the whole health interest in blueberries
399089 we have to continue to keep supply and demand in balance for the blueberry growers
399090 a lot of people who traditionally buy from growers theyre not committing and its creating a lot of uncertainty in the market
399091 this industry was due for a tremendous growing pain and i think this year is the first year of the effects of that its due to the success of the crop farmers do jump on each others bandwagons when theres a successful crop
399092 how long it will last will depend on whether the average consumer can continue to afford our crop
399093 the first year i was pleased last year i was just overwhelmed by the response
399094 there is always somebody who needs backpacks and would be happy to get it
399095 on a windy day it makes more power than we need and it turns our electric meter backward
399096 on days its not windy we use up our credit
399097 last year we were probably getting a call a week or every two weeks
399098 when youre buying a renewable energy system youre hedging future cost increases
399099 at the same time youre pre buying renewable energy for 30 to 40 years
399100 but if we create the situation where individuals can do this and make it easier for them then this will ultimately reduce our dependency on power produced by fossil fuel
399101 i think theres still a lot of misconceptions around wind turbines and a fair amount of public resistance to them
399102 a lot of people think of solar energy when they think of producing energy at home but this is just another alternative
399103 we had some concerns about it because theres an effort by the state to limit towns ability to exercise their zoning power
399104 the wind makes the blades spin around and makes the generator rotate inside a bunch of copper wire that makes electrons move and creates electricity
399105 i dont condone this have you heard but i was first
399106 ms taylor is fine the rumors which began in england about her health are dramatic overstated and untrue her hospital visit was precautionary she will be returning home shortly at present she is surrounded by family friends and fabulous jewels
399107 what i said in front of a 98 percent conservative rural white audience in missouri is nothing that i havent said before
399108 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
399109 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
399110 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
399111 im disappointed that senator obama would say the things hes saying
399112 what barack obama was saying is hes not exactly from central casting for presidential candidates
399113 you needed that job but they had to give it to a minority
399114 the hands that once picked cotton can now pick a president
399115 i was just standing out there in the heat of the day and bleeding and trying to be quiet about it
399116 i made a conscious effort to educate myself more deeply
399117 i began to study race sexuality and gender with a hope to understand my own place in the world more clearly
399118 youre going to this environment thinking youre going to make all this money
399119 but youre going back to a system that is going to keep you down
399120 it really did make me feel like i belonged somewhere and that i could be good at something
399121 i think it was 20 minutes later after i was able to do it right
399122 and i was so numb afterwards that i couldnt even say anything
399123 i passed a dark corner somebody grabbed me and i was raped
399124 it had to be one of the drill sergeants just the type of uniform that he had
399125 they thought that that was the best thing for them to do to break me down
399126 was to make myself tired enough where i couldnt think about things
399127 i thought i was crazy and i didnt connect that to the rape
399128 because i had such a great record and was one of the top soldiers in the service
399129 that proved to them that this could not happen to me
399130 you program individuals to go into the military but you dont deprogram them when they come out
399131 they dont transition properly they just walk away and if you dont deal with it then it will manifest itself later on
399132 you go you serve they honor you and you come back and then nobody talks about what happened
399133 and the nearest va is maybe a hundred miles away so youre not going to go so yeah youre going to start drinking youre going to start acting out in other ways that are going to put you in prison
399134 how do i hold the child that i left when i dont have arms
399135 i was raised not really reflecting too much upon my own race and in fact there was actually shame involved around being different
399136 i really wanted to prove that i was just as good and just as strong and just as capable as all the boys
399137 all the reasons why women shouldnt be in the military
399138 youre not capable you shouldnt be here youre holding us back
399139 because i was 22 at the time and extremely confused and just really ashamed
399140 the military reproduces the same socioeconomic inequalities that are in the civilian world
399141 if given another chance i would do it all over again
399142 i see all my experiences as opportunities for growth and change im the person i am today because of them
399143 you really dont see the peace activists or the antiwar movement in south central l a
399144 its very difficult for them to find a space to voice their experience even within the antiwar movement
399145 the problem lies in the racism that is still in our nation the problem lies in the separation of issues
399146 i think its another illusion that they value that being a warrior and a soldier are the same a soldier takes orders a warrior does things with heart
399147 das ist ein interessanter vorschlag den wir berlegen diskutieren und dann entscheiden werden

399158 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done obama said
399159 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem he said
399160 i just wanted to tell people if you need help let me know thats all it was supposed to be

399162 the point is that a small amount of money can make a big difference in peoples lives
399163 low fat and regular ice creams can sometimes be within 10 to 20 calories of each other and usually manufacturers do add more flavorings and sugar to make up for the loss of fat
399164 if you dont have a heart condition you might as well have the regular and focus on the portion size
399165 we need new answers because we are past the tipping point

399168 in the beauty pageant of alternative fuel natural gas vehicles may have gotten miss congeniality in all of this it just wasnt sexy and it might have been overlooked
399169 americans have not shown a willingness to give up anything for fuel economy
399170 its natural to look at natural gas as a viable alternative
399171 we have not found that one solution so we have to look at all options

399182 i tightened up my percentages but my costs havent gone down were working for less profit
399183 the subs have told me that the other general contractors they work for have become more slow or have no work

399194 we have now received ben mullany at our intensive care unit at morriston hospital
399195 he arrived here by ambulance at 5am today following an air ambulance flight from antigua
399196 initial medical assessments are now being undertaken by the morriston staff and it is too soon to give any further details
399197 the mps metropolitan police service will be sending a team of officers to antigua today
399198 the team which will include one officer from south wales police will support the local senior investigating officers and has been sent following a request from the antiguan authorities received through the foreign office
399199 he put his life on the line for other people all through his career
399200 i want his family to know that i will be teaching my son about modern day heroes like him
399201 adebayor is an arsenal player and will play for arsenal next season
399202 for me there has been no trouble because when a player is a true professional he goes onto the pitch and tries to play the football he loves
399203 what is very damaging sometimes is that the player gets bad publicity against his own fans for things he has not said
399204 that is sometimes difficult to repair there is disappointment from the fans because they feel the player wants to go
399205 but all i can say is that when i was face to face with him he always said his priority was to stay at the club and i told him that he has got his priorities right
399206 i am thrilled to choose kizzy as the winner of this category i own three rescue cats myself and they have helped my three children tremendously in their upbringing

399209 weve grown up with jenny shes our family she deserves better than getting sent to a drive through tourist attraction in mexico
399210 jennys situation is of great concern to many people i represent
399211 this is not an indictment of the zoo in mexico but jenny deserves to be somewhere she will be happy
399212 we know she is a nervous elephant and with protected contact she can approach people if she wants to and we can monitor her stress levels easily without anyone getting hurt or killed
399213 these animals need our help to protect their natural habitat as well as facilitate conservation programs throughout the country that are helping new generations of wildlife stewards and conservationists
399214 whenever you deal with children or animals you have to consider a lot of options
399215 were still trying to go through our plans and we usually have time to consider our options but with all the furor that weve had to go through weve had to be a little more outspoken about our choices
399216 children are drinking enormous amounts and doing a lot of partying when kids start becoming teenagers their identity is not formed yet
399217 they use whatevers in their environment if that strangulation is what is going on in their peer group they take it on
399218 i think these are normal teenagers but its the peer group way of being recognised today but this way of getting recognition these days can be very dangerous
399219 there are groups of one or two individuals actually into this perhaps these teenagers have this psycho sexual need for asphyxiation and what happens is this gets a following going maybe from a couple of guys who are not really into it but think its cool
399220 along comes some child and they think its really exciting and try it

399223 theres no question that the challenging macroeconomic environment in the u s has made it difficult to grow the top line
399224 the delays in purchases reflect economic anxieties far more than they do competitive positioning
399225 they have a client base largely comprised of telecom government and financial services customers and those segments have really slowed buying
399226 macroeconomic issues are the biggest issues a slowing economy and all the banks going out of business
399227 they have high exposure to legacy unix products that enterprises are moving away from
399228 we now enter yet another year where sun is hoping to grow slightly and expand its margins
399229 its been trying to do that the last three or four years so theres less and less investor confidence in the company
399230 most people buy on price they want to buy from the biggest vendors because they will give them the best deal in a down economy its an even harder sell for sun
399231 they have an expectation that their customers want to put it together and figure out how it works
399232 part of the problem is that they they havent done enough to reach out to the right partners to build an out of the box ecosystem of products they think too much about technology and need to think more about how all those pieces will work together
399233 history is a nightmare from which i am trying to awake

399242 crude oil fell to the lowest in 12 weeks as the u s dollar strengthened to a one month high against the euro and on signs gasoline demand may extend declines
399243 is the price of oil today too high given the fundamentals could be is it too low could be but one thing im sure thats too high is the confidence on the part of those who insist they know the answer
399244 the latest evidence suggests it is not rational to hope prices will not fall much more it is not conclusive
399245 rating agencies are currently plagued by conflicts of interest in building and rating financial products

399248 life faculties production in other words individuality liberty property this is man and in spite of the cunning of artful political leaders these three gifts from god precede all human legislation and are superior to it life liberty and property do not exist because men have made laws on the contrary it was the fact that life liberty and property existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place
399249 the law has been perverted by the influence of two entirely different causes stupid greed and false philanthropy now legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it tariffs protection benefits subsidies encouragements progressive taxation public schools guaranteed jobs guaranteed profits minimum wages a right to relief a right to the tools of labor free credit and so on and so on
399250 marries or cohabits with more than one spouse at a time in purported exercise of the right of plural marriage
399251 in the house the democrats have made clear that theres a first tier of legislation they mean to bring to a vote almost immediately after the new congress convenes it includes raising the minimum wage repealing the medicare legislation that forbids the government from negotiating with drug companies for lower prices replenishing student loan programs funding stem cell research and implementing those recommendations of the sept 11 commission that have thus far languished
399252 to kill the americans and their allies civilians and military is an individual duty for every muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it in order to liberate the al aqsa mosque jerusalem and the holy mosque mecca from their grip and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of islam defeated and unable to threaten any muslim
399253 those who demand freedom of speech do so as a compensation for the freedom of thought they so seldom use
399254 muslim girls should not be allowed to wear headscarves in public schools due to our hallowed separation of church and state the hijab is religious in nature theyre not wearing that scarf on their heads as a fashion statement
399255 but they are no less willing to use government authority in other forms such as expanded police forces and international diplomacy to protect the nation and its citizens
399256 those who won our independence did not exalt order at the cost of liberty
399257 it would be inherently cruel to move her to mexico

399272 anyone can find out who defaults on their mortgage payments it s all public information
399273 unfortunately there are many heartless opportunists posing as foreclosure rescue companies who promise to assist homeowners while literally stealing everything they can from them
399274 protect yourselves by checking with the better business bureau call the company and don t be ashamed to ask for references
399275 we have heard of many scams tempting cash offers or promises of buying the property with the intent to sell it back to the owner may be traps owners simply need to check everything don t sign anything without fully understanding the implications don t sign under pressure absolutely do not sign your deed away and don t pay in advance for any service if you are in foreclosure it is illegal for anyone to charge you an upfront fee
399276 fraudsters use false advertisements claiming that they can save your home they acquire the lists of homeowners in foreclosure from every source possible and send hundreds of postcards daily
399277 fraudsters convince the property owner that they will resolve all issues with their lender the homeowner is requested to sign over 1 8 of their deed to a company controlled by the fraudster and is requested to make the monthly payments to that company as opposed to the bank
399278 i sweated a lot and people were staring at me thinking im a crazy foreign guy
399279 i interviewed local people and asked how they felt about the olympics i am glad that i could move around with no restrictions
399280 i am impressed by the amount of people working here
399281 there are even two volunteers in front of the toilet room in mpc
399282 but if they dont understand they call other people for help i once had four to five volunteers around me trying to help its so cool
399283 its only 15 minutes away by bus from the mpc the bed is big enough and the pillow is comfortable
399284 i spent 30 us dollars on laundry in turin winter games for a bag of clothes here is free its nice

399291 we would like to see the greatest degree of openness
399292 there has been no change in the iocs position the ioc would like to see open access
399293 when there were problems on wednesday the iocs team met with the organising committee and asked if they could be resolved
399294 we can only encourage moving towards that openness and transparency
399295 this is a major milestone we can share with our sport and broadcast partners who worked closely with us to develop a balanced games schedule that satisfies the respective international sport federations television audiences around the world and spectators who will attend the games
399296 chinas security forces including the police armed forces and the military have adopted comprehensive measures to be prepared and have carried out drills many times to cope with all possible threats

399308 im horrified i got the impression he was violent its frightening very frightening i think people should be told when they have someone like that living next door to them
399309 he used to shout quite a lot it wasnt nice but back then we didnt know about the guys history
399310 were it open to me to send you to prison for 12 months i would not hesitate to do so
399311 we have now received mr ben mullany at our intensive care unit at morriston hospital
399312 today if people become unwell there are few options available to us to support them at home
399313 if its felt for their own safety and others it is best for them to come into hospital then they will do but from october there will be the alternative of supporting them safely in their own homes
399314 most of what they will do is whats called talking therapies listening to the patients talking and engaging with individuals and their relatives
399315 this often takes time and this initiative will give staff the time to engage fully in peoples own homes
399316 its a great idea if youve got many highly skilled and highly qualified staff available 24 hours a day the trouble with psychiatric patients is when they go off they need instant and specialist help
399317 if you treat people in the community without a very high standard of care there will be problems
399318 wrong decisions have been made and it is time for the politicians to wake up and give some direction to this sorry state of affairs
399319 we see the new fund as the unfair scotland fund as there will be more losers than winners
399320 its a fast road and then there is a roundabout and people just dont slow down quickly enough
399321 the exit and entrance roads join on to the a1 so if you are going north you have to cross the carriageway and join the traffic so these are difficult junctions and obviously busy when people are going to and from work
399322 we would have to look at how the volume of traffic on the road has increased
399323 and we dont know what the level of accidents would have been if dualling had not taken place
399324 it could be something as simple as improving lighting at junctions the a1 is popular with people who do not know the area so perhaps improved signage would help
399325 i wanted to do something to pay homage to my mum she loved the idea of travel and experiencing other countries and cultures so i know she would have been enthralled by the idea of crossing an entire country on foot
399326 although the concept of walking for charity is well established in the uk it is almost unheard of in spain it made sense to try this route rather than a more traditional walk like john ogroats to lands end
399327 its going to be a bit different from scottish walking it is going to be so hot up to 45 degrees i just wont be able to walk at midday ill have to start at 5 30am when it is fresh then do things the traditional spanish way with a big meal and a siesta probably having a nap under a tree before setting off again in the evening
399328 there are british passport holders who live in the uk who are being found in places like kandahar
399329 there is a link between kandahar and urban conurbations in the uk this is something the military understands but the british public does not
399330 the most challenging mission i have done in my career
399331 this would affect every service and while its sad that its come to industrial action it shows just how much is provided by local government
399332 at schools head teachers will have to carry out a risk assessment before deciding whether to open but there is a long history of problems with heating on the first day of school
399333 at public venues local authority workers have to check that rules are being followed and if that person isnt there then the venues cant open
399334 but there is time to stop this going ahead and the employers need to come back to the table with a revised offer
399335 pay rises are something that affect everybody whereas service cuts are quite local and some people are more passionate than others
399336 although we havent yet had formal notification we understand that there is going to be industrial action on august 20
399337 management will be meeting with local trade union representatives to find out their plans in respect of local services in the meantime we will keep our contingency plans under review should industrial action go ahead
399338 the second phase of this project has produced more achievable targets for improving services and reducing costs within the council
399339 weve already started making headway by streamlining agency costs and making revisions in procurement and home based care services
399340 theres still a long way to go to enable us to fully maximise potential savings but i stress once again that this is not an exercise about reducing jobs but about making the council an even more effective organisation
399341 he does not come to save only we can save ourselves maitreya helps us become the souls we essentially are
399342 the dream to provide electricity across the country by signing the indo us nuclear deal is not true
399343 nuclear power is not a safe affordable or better option for producing electricity rather nuclear power is a very dangerous and expensive option the indo us nuclear deal is actually a political and military deal
399344 u s citizens should be aware of the risk posed by the deteriorating security situation in mexico and along the border
399345 violent criminal activity including murder and kidnapping in mexico has increased
399346 how is it that a kidnapping in a feign country of a feign national gets investigated and resolved by american law enforcement while other not so connected americans who are currently being held for ransom some who are believed to have been kidnapped from american soil and taken to a feign country and held for ransom while still other americans have been executed murdered wounded and held for ransom in mexico with no apparent u s law enforcement investigation or follow up how can that be
399347 suffer from lack of funds and training and the judicial system is weak overworked and inefficient
399348 i worry that the inability of local law enforcement to come to grips with rising drug warfare kidnappings and random street violence will have a chilling effect on the cross border exchange tourism and commerce so vital to the regions prosperity
399349 statistics vary among watchdog groups but they agree that mexico has surpassed colombia a country plagued by decades of guerrilla and drug violence in the number of journalists killed each year
399350 many mexican reporters particularly in the embattled border states have stopped writing about organized crime and as the drug war spreads south journalists across the country are becoming targets on may 3 world press freedom day the decapitated body of a local drug dealer turned up outside a newspaper in the eastern port city of veracruz according to local press reports the killers left this warning for milo youll all pay you know it and more heads of damned reporters are going to roll the threat was presumed to be directed at milo vera a local columnist theres total impunity said jose antonio calcanio president of the federation of mexican journalists associations which represents 137 journalist groups nationwide the government has no interest in resolving any of these cases calcanio said its only when theres a prominent case like amado ramirez that they pretend to act but then they forget and nothing happens two suspects were arrested in the days after the radio hosts murder but both were released on bail many of ramirezs colleagues suspect the men were scapegoats
399351 the u s government would like to think that drug violence is just a problem south of the rio grande it isnt
399352 were seeing outright lawlessness along the u s mexican border things are just getting out of hand
399353 u s citizens should be aware of the risk posed by the deteriorating security situation
399354 if the same circumstance that now exist in mexico existed in any other country the u s state dept would advise americans to not even go there
399355 if it s not safe for u s soldiers than it is unsafe for other americans
399356 communication is very important and useful in our lives if we dont communicate there is no understanding one another in your own family and everywhere you go it is good to have good communication it is very important to develop good communication in our society
399357 ive known that communication is an important part of life but until now no one has ever been able to tell anyone how to communicate
399358 i learned how to be calm when responding to a disaster
399359 the fool says in his heart there is no god
399360 you can take a woman out of webster but you can t make a square rotary
399361 what the world need now is love sweet love it s the only thing that there s just to little of
399362 you know how all the horror geeks get extra nervous when someone starts talking about a remake of john carpenters the thing despite the fact that as awesome as it is and boy is it awesome it itself is a remake
399363 it was a key movie of a generation especially for those of us who got into computing
399364 i want to build a clock that ticks once a year the century hand advances once every one hundred years and the cuckoo comes out on the millennium i want the cuckoo to come out every millennium for the next 10 000 years
399365 theres a big sign that alerts you to the fact you are entering a 20mph zone then you are met by a whole load of messages saying in fact you can still go 30mph
399366 they were put in around new year i think and everyone thought maybe they were going to take down the 30 signs and paint over them but it doesnt seem to have happened at all
399367 all around here its a bit confusing because when you drive up to wester hailes from sighthill its not really clear whether you are supposed to be going 30 or 40
399368 perhaps this is symptomatic of the lib dem snp administrations stop start policy
399369 there are roads in the city when one minute youre at 40 then 20 then 30 and up to 60 its quite unnecessary
399370 and then when you ask for street signs for specific reasons it becomes harder ive been calling for a horses warning sign near blinkbonny but was told it would create too much street clutter meanwhile in baberton crescent seven twentys plenty signs were put up
399371 my old ward used to cover sighthill avenue and we worked hard with the local residents to introduce street calming measures this will cause a lot of confusion if we want motorists to abide by these regulations then we have to be clear about them
399372 a team have been out and while the signs are close together they are both technically correct
399373 ive lived here for 17 years and ive never seen the street turn into a river before theres a dip in the road outside the front entrance to the stairway where the water eventually gathered and it didnt disappear for over 12 hours
399374 it appears that the existing drains have been removed from amongst other locations outside my house at the pedestrian crossing opposite stafford street
399375 we told them not to remove the drain months ago as the next nearest one is 100 yards up the road but they insisted one was enough
399376 whilst i can accept that there has to be disruption and general inconvenience as a part of putting the tram in i didnt realise that we were signing up to flooding peoples houses
399377 we are being told the flooding was caused by a once in a century meteorological event i wonder then if we can expect noah to be sailing down princes street anytime soon
399378 we are confident that none of the work we carried out in the area recently could have been responsible for any flooding
399379 there is a larger turnout of chinese paraders this year but we also have a contingent from buddhist organisation falun dafa which has carried out protests outside the chinese consulate for some years but have continually walked side by side with chinese paraders
399380 when the festival was set up in 1947 it was with the aim of casting war and politics aside in the name of drama and the arts and this is still as true today as it was then
399381 the cavalcade was started over 30 years ago by the eif but its grown to become a showcase for the fringe the mela the jazz festival and the tattoo
399382 its a tough job bringing all of these people together ive been doing the organising almost single handedly up until the day that is since 2004 and its a massive administrative task
399383 its a fun day though so it will all be worth it
399384 we expect in the region of 175 000 people to attend this years cavalcade and we have the appropriate number of officers in place to ensure the safety of the public and participants
399385 we started five years ago and have grown each year from just two initially
399386 every year its getting more and more accepted as a way of doing the fringe but there are still a lot of people who think its free it must be rubbish
399387 we have a good feeling that this year with the credit crunch and problems getting fringe tickets we will see an increase in audiences

399415 wien steht f r ein qualitatives und flexibles kinderbetreuungsangebot dass sich an den bed rfnissen der eltern orientiert und nicht an alten r ckschrittlichen gesellschaftsmodellen festh lt die stadt vp mag lieber in der vergangenheit verweilen die sozialdemokratie stellt sich den zukunftsfragen und unterst tzt die wienerinnen bei der umsetzung ihrer eigenen individuellen lebensmodelle daher hat wien auch die h chste frauenerwerbsquote stererichs
399416 w hrend die vp durch ihre r ckschrittliche familienpolitik nichts f r die eigenst ndige existenzsicherung der frauen anbietet versucht wien die vereinbarkeit von familie und beruf durch qualitative und flexible kinderbetreuungsangebote zu unterst tzen w hrend in den bundesl ndern m tter aufgrund der begrenzten ffnungszeiten nur teilzeit oder gar nicht arbeiten k nnen gehen in wien mehr m ttern einer vollzeitbesch ftigung nach so haben hier 41 prozent der betreuten kinder eine vollzeitbesch ftigte mutter diese hohe zahl beweist dass dieses betreuungsmodell gerne angenommen wird und wien die berufst tigkeit damit bestens unterst tzt
399417 f r uns sind kinderg rten keine aufbewahrungsst tten sondern orte des spielens und lernens darum hat wien als erstes bundesland einen eigenen bildungsplan eingef hrt und hier arbeitet auch das bestgeschulte betreuungspersonal sterreichs
399418 das sind um rund 15 000 pl tze mehr als in nieder sterreich und auch f r klein und schulkinder wird in wien mit abstand am besten gesorgt hier befinden sich die h lfte aller kripppen und ein drittel aller hortpl tze sterreichs
399419 das alles ist m glich weil die stadt wien von allen bundesl ndern j hrlich das meiste geld ber 300 millionen euro f r die kinderbetreuung aufwendet dadurch sind die angebotenen leistungen f r eltern und kinder besser als in allen anderen bundesl ndern und darum kann wien auch hochwertige bildungsst tten anbieten statt r ckschrittlicher aufbewahrungsst tten die um 12 uhr mittags zusperren

399424 der designierte sp kandidat faymann hat donnerstag molterers 3 stufen plan gegen die teuerung begr t
399425 dabei ist diese kritik v llig unverst ndlich die vp will tausende pendler alleinverdiener und pflegebed rftige entlasten eine ablehnung dieser wichtigen hilfe f r die betroffenen im kampf gegen die teuerung ist nicht nachvollziehbar die gusenbauer faymann sp hat daher ihre genossen nach wie vor nicht im griff

399454 volgens gertjan verbeek is krachttraining van groot belang bij het voetbal
399455 bovendien voelde de populaire zanger al tijdens de afscheidstournee de dringende behoefte zijn gevoelens over het naderende einde van het tijdperk bzn op een rijtje te zetten
399456 wir haben jetzt kapazit tsm ssig aufgeholt und finden langsam aber sicher wieder die balance
399457 some players cant cope with those sort of conditions they sweat too much and when that happens they cant perform to the best of their ability
399458 we wanted to make sure that every player we picked can deal with the conditions
399459 they have done sweat testing heat and humidity testing and core temperature testing
399460 we have been training twice a day including once at midday when temperatures are even higher than they will be at kickoff time
399461 tactically we also have something we do which i cant make public
399462 we have to make the field as small as possible we have to be compact in midfield
399463 im glad hes playing because that means that when we beat them they wont have any excuses
399464 en tant que folle sympa joccupe une place part dans le cin ma fran ais

399467 whatever i have to do if i have to go to his house ill be there
399468 if he needs me to do it ill definitely do it just this first year
399469 i want to make a difference as soon as i can
399470 a lot of rookies may feel slighted to come up to a veteran and extend themselves like that but hes said to me he wants to learn as much as he can
399471 i just want to help push him along to be as good as he can be because i know he can play
399472 i really thought he was starting to play faster and thats the big thing in our business
399473 you have to play physical and fast and he looked like he was starting to get it so hopefully this injury wont set him back too far
399474 we want to try to put him in all these positions because weve got to find out what he can do
399475 yeah were counting on him making plays for us this year
399476 evidently they feel i can do something that they didnt see me do in college and im all for it
399477 every other day somebody else is getting signed and its a db
399478 so its like man my time could be up next i just try to blank that out and think about this year and what ive got to do
399479 and now ive got to start every day in practice making plays and grinding it out
399480 it just feels like youve got one hand to play with
399481 chris is a guy that ended last year with a broken hand and that kind of limited him some toward the end of last year
399482 but hes come back and worked very hard this offseason and hes having a good camp
399483 i could be that next db but it starts first on the field
399484 ive got to make myself go out there and have fun and make plays like i know i can when i see that it just puts a smile on my face that i could be one of those guys
399485 i feel like we could be one of the best secondaries in this league
399486 with richard marshall gamble and lucas weve got three starting corners on our team weve got depth at safety myself charles whos an excellent player he brings a bunch of experience to this game so im real excited about the group weve got
399487 its exactly what we expected and its exactly why we put the lights in so we could get out and get out of the heat on occasion
399488 and its great the fans can come out and see a very good practice they were focused intense and spirited and executed very well tonight
399489 the fact we can practice without tearing up our game field is important too
399490 come october november it will get really torn up convenience wise its really great plus just getting acclimated to the time a lot of these guys in college arent used to playing at night we havent played at night since a monday night game last year its really good for your body to get the timing down so you know what it feels like to play at that time
399491 a lot of guys look forward to that to get a little change of pace a little breakup
399492 but the fans cant come out there so youre basically out there by ourselves when they brought those lights in its like oh man i guess well be out here and have the fans out for a night practice thats going to be cool
399493 coach fishers done a great job of doing that it just makes it more fun and gets you out of your routine
399494 coach fishers big on that simulating game time situations and everything so definitely leading up to that game with the colts thats going to be an important division game hell have us out there practicing at night
399495 hes very instinctive youve seen the way he can play the ball his nickname is johnny on the spot
399496 its a game you play with your skills but you also need to play with your mind
399497 once you get things down you run around and play football like youre a little kid again you have to be very precise
399498 my dad was a proud person and the way he taught judo he wanted us to be the best
399499 my family is so strict and it was all about judo and any other sport was forbidden especially football because it was so violent
399500 my brother thought my personality would be a great fit for it and it certainly was
399501 in judo its a lot of hip turns and hip explosion i think it really helps my explosiveness and my quickness
399502 i dont know how many interceptions haruki has got but the ball finds him
399503 its funny but the same guys are always getting lucky he looks kind of like will demps but faster
399504 i was always one of those guys who people said was too small too slow or wasnt aggressive enough
399505 its kind of special its unique to be a representative of a group
399506 theres times when i have to squeeze passes in there but the majority of the time weve got to take what we can and give them the ball and let them make the play
399507 thats whats going to help t j a lot knowing that he has playmakers in these skill positions
399508 thats going to make him very confident to get us the ball and thats going to help him look good
399509 at first nobody on other teams really knew what we were doing
399510 we went deep a whole lot the first three games after a while people started backing up on us so we had to dumb it down a little bit its the acc defenses theyre not stupid they know what were doing they know we like to go deep so we had to do other things throughout the season
399511 i watched up close and personal with bernie kosar and troy aikman and kenny seen some quarterbacks that they were just obsessed over watching film
399512 you see that with t j he knew he couldnt throw in the springtime so he watched a lot of film he was being very proactive in trying to do that and i think that certainly he has the opportunity to build on 12 games of experience i get a sense from him that theres a lot more personal self confidence hes been in games he knows what he can do and i think hes eager to do not only that but to even be better
399513 you have to understand in my little world i was on top of the world for a second
399514 and then i got humbled down to be just happy that im alive
399515 but im more excited than nervous im so excited to be able to play football again
399516 all of them are doing a great job theyre moving the offense theyre doing the things we want to get done one day in practice cannon threw a deep ball the next day robert threw a deep ball then another day jacory threw a deep ball so to me theyre all doing a great job for us trying to win the game and lead our offense
399517 having an opportunity to play at the university of miami is a great honor for me and my family
399518 im really looking forward to the opportunity that i have i feel like myself for the first time in a very long time
399519 we all like each other and i think thats a big thing
399520 we all have a fun time together we have a good time working i think we make each other a lot stronger on the field its a lot of help when you can talk to a player and say this happened on your back side or this happened on your front side or this happened on a blitz so its been a lot of help having other guys by your side
399521 hes a very athletic quarterback and hes very competitive and he goes out to win
399522 he tries to be a playmaker thats the attitude you want i dont want to single out marve all the other quarterbacks have done a tremendous job too
399523 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
399524 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they ave retained the hunger they need to succeed
399525 when were playing charleston southern well be playing charleston southern when were ready for florida well be ready for florida
399526 just cant wait to play them going to be a good game lot of competition going on on the field lot of guys psyched up well be ready
399527 id be in there with guys and saying things to them like the bus to gainesville is leaving im on it hope to see you on it it just motivated guys to want to work and when wed work out no guys werent slouching guys were working when we said that
399528 ive done my research on it i understand that we havent beaten them in quite a while
399529 i go to sleep at night and dream about what that stadium is going to look like on the second game at 8 oclock at night
399530 understanding outpatient coding in provider based setting where apcs meet rvus
399531 using the internet to start and grow your small business
399532 if the opportunity comes again i feel like it would be a definite id think about it
399533 i think if i played a couple pga events in a row it would be a different story
399534 its just hard to play one and then one maybe a year later
399535 i think if i played eight in a row and i missed all eight that would be a different story
399536 missing greens ive always had to find a way to get up and down so my wedge game has always been pretty good and if you put a little bit of luck in there you hole out a few shots
399537 obviously the score doesnt show it but i know what i need to work on i gave it my best today and i felt like i did a lot of good things and hopefully that outshines the ones i made mistakes on
399538 everything went pretty smoothly out there i hit a lot of fairways lots of greens and made a bunch of 10 footers i mean just kind of the way you like to draw it up
399539 i didnt know what the course record was but i caught myself thinking about 59 at no 14 i had like about a 10 footer
399540 i thought if i birdie the last five holes i can shoot 59 and thats just the worst thing to think so i made par there

399544 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
399545 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
399546 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
399547 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
399548 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
399549 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
399550 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
399551 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
399552 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
399553 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
399554 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
399555 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
399556 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
399557 ik heb veel mensen gesproken en ze vertelden me dat ajax in de jaren zeventig met een extreem jonge ploeg en een nieuwe spelopvatting de europa cup won
399558 de mensen zeggen dan dat we met arsenal ook die kant op gaan maar we moeten nog die ene stap zetten richting een grote prijs
399559 voor het ek wist ik niet hoe het voelde om iets te winnen nu heb ik die ervaring wel en weet ik wat er voor nodig is

399579 i think pryor is going to be great at ohio state
399580 just to put him in the game shows you how good hes going to be his rating in the game shows you how much confidence everyone has in him
399581 im as anxious as everybody to see what its going to look like
399582 we want him to be an example so other guys see how he practices
399583 were putting it on different guys give him a chance to be a leader and making sure he stands out

399595 what a farce not only has the taxpayer had to stump up for eight years worth of food and accommodation for george but things will only go from bad to worse now
399596 clearing this man will undoubtedly sow seeds of concern in the minds of the public that the police failed to do their job properly and have let the real murderer run loose on our streets for the last 9 years confidence in the justice market is bound to take a big hit

399853 gt will may of east rochester is doing well after receiving a new kidney from kaylea seward
399854 i didnt understand any of the terminology they were using
399855 i cannot deal with just taking him home and letting him pass away at home
399856 i knew will since he was born when i saw he was really sick his mom talked to me about everything that was going on with him i just thought about it for a few weeks i felt like he was kind of like a part of my family hes always been very special to me and i love him very much so i think thats probably why
399857 i was really nervous and excited at the same time to see if i could be the one to save his life
399858 not to brag about it but it seemed kind of cool and exciting a lot of things were going through my mind about a lot of the risks the doctors were telling me
399859 hes getting back to where he was before the surgery hes awake now and hes smiling and laughing again hes doing excellent
399860 because will was so ill going into the surgery we were very concerned about his recovery
399861 but hes a strong child and hes doing very well now if he werent such a fighter he might not have made it through those first weeks following the transplant
399862 theres a lot of risk involved but i think its really important to help other people and not just think about yourself
399863 when i called kaylea she showed up with her mom and i just instantly knew that this was a really great family
399864 my kids and my whole family are so happy that weve gotten to know her for a young woman she has incredible generosity and love that she could teach any adult
399865 she went in and she did it all without ever hesitating whatsoever
399866 it was like the happiest thing you could ever dream of this has been a very long road it has not been easy by far this is my child this is all i could dream of the past two and a half years getting him to this point to get the surgery done
399867 the boy is a charmer you put him in the little stroller thingies in the hospital walking down the hall and anybody that sees him is going to stop and say isnt he so cute what a little prince will still catches peoples eyes he is just so amazing
399868 i decided that i was going to go for my passion instead of all your benefits your vacation time your guaranteed salary i wanted to be happy in my career
399869 i figured i would go into it an give it a try for a couple of weeks in school and if i didnt like it i didnt lose anything
399870 youre going to have to work forever in life so you might as well do something you enjoy doing
399871 ill put a lot of thought into a cut but i enjoy just jumping in and going for it having fun with it
399872 a lot of its based on the eye as long as you have the principals down run with it dont be afraid of it
399873 i wanted to get more creative than a day of retouches
399874 i wanted to get in there and cut i wanted to use the scissors i wanted to use razors in the hair
399875 when you find a good person you stick with them
399876 he always takes the extra mile and talks to you lets you know what would be good on you
399877 i wanted to bring something fresh and unique to the area
399878 its got that small town feel but its also very professional
399879 i feel like ive gotten to know him a lot better in his own salon
399880 he very warm and honest and he has a really good sense of humor
399881 i think the biggest thing is to respect your clients
399882 theyre number one youve got to make them happy and you need to listen to them theyre your advertising
399883 its very stressful but its more in a positive way because its your own place
399884 your working for yourself not someone else you see the direct payoff
399885 on a chilly day she sat by the radiator and had her classbook in her hand
399886 she had that there if she wanted to smile or something she would put it over her face when smiling or chuckling so it wouldnt be obvious
399887 they had the name tags on and from their high school pictures she could remember where they sat in her class
399888 i said you dont think a high school teacher wont teach you grammar you have to know how to use who and whom and i made sure they knew i made sure they spelled and wrote not just read literature i pushed hard but i think they appreciated it
399889 i knew i wanted to be an english teacher when i was a little girl in our kitchen at home
399890 my mom was cooking my sister doing what she was doing and i was teaching
399891 if i didnt read the first few pages they would never get into it
399892 did you really read all of those books ms novelli
399893 if they were rambunctious or noisy id slam it down
399894 it made me look dictatorial or tough i wasnt any of that
399895 she had a wonderful sense of humor and was very considerate of the students
399896 she would listen to you if you had a family concern or if something was going on today we call them guidance counselors
399897 they really did set the standard for us and get us started
399898 it was when i started dreaming in french that i knew i was going to be ok
399899 everyone used public transportation and we ate cheese and bread during every meal and dessert was always part of dinner i loved the crepes
399900 he wanted to make sure that i became as fluent as possible and in a short amount of time
399901 about a month ago i got a test back in history class
399902 my teacher announced to the class that i had received a grade and that my grade was actually better that some of the others in the class not only did i know the information but my french was at the level of the others

399906 the interior of the bank features a beautifully scaled two story high banking floor with a mezzanine at the rear
399907 the banking floor has a wonderful natural lighting provided by monumental triple hung divided lite wood windows
399908 the bank came in with samples of the materials and drawings of the proposed changes
399909 at that time they werent designated so it was more of a courtesy the bank was very much in favor of the designation here we had an example of a building owner that was welcoming the design and being a good citizen in taking care of their buildings its respected history and its place in the community
399910 were learning a lot about the history of the village and weve learned that respecting and recognizing the history of the village through its architectural resources is just a good form of planning
399911 the planning is really there to help maintain and build the villages pride in itself which helps businesses and brings in businesses and visitors and brings back your children to this place we call fairport so thats the part of the planning that is looking toward the future by recognizing the past

399931 menurut hemat saya selama ini pak sutanto saya lihat cukup baik dalam menjalankan tugasnya memberantas perjudian memberantas narkoba dan terorisme meskipun ada beberapa juga yang kecolongan jadi patut kalau presiden sby memperpanjang sampai dengan pemilu 2009 supaya situasinya tetap kondusif
399932 saya tidak dalam posisi mendukung atau tidak karena soal kapolri semuanya hak prerogatif presiden saya serahkan sepenuhnya pada presiden namun karena proses pemilu mulai kampanye sudah berjalan biarkan ini kondusif karena kalau ada perubahan komandan biasanya ada pergantian pergantian

399953 take that 300 000 contract awarded outside the normal tender process to another jasper friend joel oloughlin to run a london website even though his company had no web expertise and was based in liverpool the lda wanted to sack and even sue oloughlin after he lied to them and failed to deliver but after an intervention by mr jasper it ended up offering him another 250 000 and a lucrative consultancy the evidence for this is yet more leaked emails plus the on the record testimony of the lda programme manager responsible for the contract
