3360040 a reliable supply of petrol for the advancing allied forces following the d day landings was of the highest priority planners knew that the future invasion of europe would be the largest amphibious landing in history and without adequate and reliable supplies of petrol any advance would at best slow down and at worst grind to a halt a loss of momentum could jeopardise the whole operation as german forces would have time to regroup and counter attack conventional tankers and ship to shore pipelines were in danger of cluttering up the beaches obstructing the movement of men armaments and materials and in all circumstances were subject to the vagaries of the weather and sea conditions and they were easy targets for the luftwaffe the idea of a pipe line under the ocean the english channel was an innovative solution it was known that oil storage facilities located near the english channel would be vulnerable to attack by the luftwaffe to reduce the risk of losses a network of pipelines was during early discussions about pluto already under construction this was designed to carry fuel from safer storage and port facilities around bristol and liverpool to the english channel this network would later be linked to the planned pipeline at skanklin on the isle of wight and dungeness further to the west the terminals and pumping stations were heavily disguised as bungalows gravel pits garages and even an ice cream shop soon after d day a continuous flow of petrol to meet the heavy demands of the liberation armies and air fleets was maintained by the pipelines under the ocean these pipe lines were vital arteries which enabled the allied air fleets and land forces to maintain the vital momentum needed to secure victory moreover operation pluto made it possible to dispense with the fleets of tankers which otherwise would have been necessary and spared them the ordeal of concentrated enemy attacks in congested waters thus undoubtedly saving many hundreds of gallant lives

3360053 it makes me want to now really be even louder about issues and concerns that before i was willing to look the other way
3360054 this fact has seemingly surprised a number of progressive people who are bemoaning obamas shift to the center its sad that some who seek progressive change are missing the forest for the trees
3360055 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority
3360056 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3360057 but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward
3360058 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal health care to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize
3360059 it was not an endorsement and i have no further comment
3360060 obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move our nation forward with a broadly progressive agenda
3360061 at the core are americas working families of all hues and ethnicities whose determination to move forward does not depend on and will not be diverted by the daily twists and turns of this watershed presidential campaign they are taking the long view
3360062 if obamas candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term

3360064 the communist party usa views the 2008 elections as a tremendous opportunity to defeat the policies of the right wing republicans and to move our country in a new progressive direction

3360082 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3360096 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards

3360100 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3360108 we dont think its fair that this population is singled out
3360109 the word and the portrayal of a mentally challenged person are a source of ridicule
3360110 it makes people a combination of furious and just really disturbed at the end of the day this has to be a teachable moment
3360111 this project represents the first comprehensive multi university collaborative effort in investigating security issues for grid computing including storage information management and collaboration tools for sensitive data
3360112 while many companies are involved in grids their security model is often not capable of handling the complexity the air force deals with which includes heterogeneous data and diverse partners with different clearances
3360113 comprehensive policies for data sharing are extremely critical and this project should provide fundamental insights into that
3360114 the most challenging part of the project is to ensure the information grid is secure and at the same time ensure information is managed shared and disseminated efficiently
3360115 we are becoming a top tier institution in areas such as data security and knowledge discovery
3360116 we are also introducing novel new courses on topics such as cloud computing that address the needs of government industry and academia alike
3360117 we have also formed a strong partnership with corporations such as raytheon
3360118 our goal is to solve problems in both cyber security and national security that are critical to the nation

3360127 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3360128 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3360129 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3360159 this moment calls for more than playacting yet obama looks lost without a presidential script perhaps this is not a time for a novice spouting grand rhetoric about a new page in history but for someone whos actually read the pages of some old but still relevant books perhaps this is not the time for playacting
3360160 as always we will take advice from the home office and the foreign office we are not experts in law in every country so it is wise to speak with the people who are

3360179 with this release we have taken an enormous leap towards creating an application agnostic transaction monitoring platform that is exclusive in its ability to provide superior end to end application performance management functionality at a fifth of the cost traditionally associated with enterprise wide technology implementations

3360184 spammers are moving en masse to the web and distributing malware on a scale not seen before criminals are not bothering to set up their own sites they are infecting legitimate sites with malicious code we can no longer rely on traditional url filtering lists because the safe sites may no longer warrant that trust the use of webmail accounts to send spam makes ip reputation or message header inspection less effective because the spam is generated using gmail yahoo and hotmail so the messages will appear to come from legitimate sources in our view the use of botnets to launch mass website attacks is the most concerning issue to arise so far in 2008
3360185 we are now in the situation where spam accounts for almost 90 percent of all email and increasingly contains links to infected sites
3360186 companies really need to employ a combination of email security gateways that have anti spam protection using multiple techniques to block malicious content and products that do not just rely on url filtering but also scan the content that end users are downloading and uploading in real time
3360187 onshore industrial projects such as lng terminals refineries and plants like the one involved in this contract are more often constructed in remote areas

3360195 whats critical here is that early weight loss may provide lasting benefits for risk factor control that in turn can reduce diabetes related complications and mortality
3360196 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3360197 these findings suggest that even in the face of weight regain losing weight can have long lasting benefits in type 2 diabetes
3360198 the therapeutic advantage achieved through weight loss is exceedingly important given the close connection between glycemic and blood pressure control and cardiovascular outcomes
3360199 we dont know if the initial weight loss increases the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes are the reason for the long term health benefits what we do know is that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death
3360200 our results confirmed that therapeutic enabling quantities of al 108 or al 208 were found in the cerebrospinal fluid csf of the healthy adults and the alzheimers patients
3360201 the amounts of al 108 and al 208 in the csf were dose proportional and both drugs were safe and well tolerated by the test subjects
3360202 the modest intra individual variability observed in the alzheimers patients validates the intranasal route of administration for this therapeutic indication and provides us with added confidence in moving this program forward

3360210 we gave ourselves 60 days to get the final agreement and terms completed however the excitement from all parties gave this initiative top priority the opportunity to partner with wi technology and participate in this project is absolutely a huge opportunity for the freedom financial holdings shareholders we believe the technical and economic viability of this breakthrough technology has the potential to significantly increase and change the production of heavy oil resources
3360211 the first oil production leases contain approximately 1500 acres with oil reserves that are estimated to be over 800 million usd after first witnessing the conversion process of old hard asphalt separate back into its original form with sand and gravel at the bottom and pure oil at the top we at freedom financial holdings and wi technology believe this proprietary heavy oil conversion technology could potentially change part of the processes involved with domestic oil production
3360212 final negotiations with the drilling company should be completed over the next few days once this agreement is consummated we hope to be producing oil within 60 90 days the most exciting point concerning this whole initiative is that we know where the oil is this is not exploration but production samples of oil from the first lease have been evaluated and first indications show that we have very good grade of oil the missouri department of natural resources estimates missouri has between 35 billion and 42 billion in heavy oil reserves

3360249 this recalcitrant airline can neither claim to be unaware of the fact that the sultan and his entourage were waiting at the vip lounge nor pretend not to know they had not boarded as at the time the flight took off

3360252 he advocates the full repeal of doma which goes farther than hillary clinton who only recommended repealing part of the defense of marriage act
3360253 hes talking about opening up the military to homosexuality in a time of war hes talking about gay adoption putting children in homes that are intentionally fatherless or intentionally motherless and using the white house bully pulpit to do that

3360433 actually we were quite lucky for as we toured the vatican a swiss guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors and if id be so kind as to step into his private room and wait the pope would personally greet me sure enough five minutes later the pope walked through the door and shook my hand i knelt down and he spoke to me

3360452 the non observance by turkey of rules and regulations governing air traffic constitutes a serious threat to the safety of air flights in the region and a breach of its international obligations
3360453 at the same time its attempt to upgrade contrary to security council resolutions an illegal secessionist entity in the occupied part of the republic of cyprus to the detriment of a sovereign country member of the united nations and the european union constitutes a blatant violation of international law and united nations resolutions with serious ramifications for the peace and stability of the region
3360454 it should finally heed international law and respect without any preconditions the independence and territorial integrity of the republic of cyprus in accordance with un resolutions thus contributing to the maintenance of stability and prosperity in the region

3360456 listen you cant do that because the five billion creators of this free software will be very angry
3360457 itwire com professionals who work on the basis of billable hours rarely take the time out to write an article for publication unless they have a valid reason for doing so
3360458 the learning curve for linux and freeware is enormous because it involves relearning computing from scratch with software that is not user friendly
3360459 so instead of coming from large reputable companies freeware comes from students underemployed programmers and fly by nighters from distant continents who ask for donations rather than payment who seem to have little idea of what american commercial users want and expect in a professional environment
3360460 windows is typically bundled with the purchase of a new computer buying it that way really only adds about 75 under bulk licenses to computer makers and that is money that cant really be saved by avoiding windows because computers sold without any os or with linux as an alternative are hard to find and dont sell cheaper
3360461 a linux diy installation like a diy auto repair is extremely complex convoluted time consuming and often dicey
3360462 re installations of windows may restore the desired level of functionality at minimal cost and yet provide more utility for middle aged computers that are not powerful enough for new versions of linux
3360463 open office does not have grammar check and does not have an envelope maker
3360464 as discussed in our pr meeting this morning david amp i have spoken with maureen ogara based on go ahead from brianv and planted the story she has agreed to not attribute the story to us
3360465 inform maureen o gara senior editor client server news linuxgram or john markoff nyt of announcement on aug 28 2000 owner dougmil approval received from brianv to proceed
3360466 contact eric raymond tim oreilly or bruce perrins to solicit support for this going against the objectives of the open source movement owner dougmil doug miller note that i will not be doing this maureen ogara said she was going to call them so it looks better coming from her
3360467 the good news is that legal greed is used to leverage attorneys to represent their clients to the best of their ability or bill a lot of hours trying
3360468 so for those inclined to try linux for free the break even point is about 15 billable minutes far less time than is needed to actually install it assuming that you find a deal for a computer without a proprietary os
3360469 linux on a desktop pc currently doesnt save money for people with an income of x00 dollar hour
3360470 in one case i went into detail about the article and pointed out some of the areas in which it was deficient in reasoning
3360471 so far as i know an article cannot reason at all the articles composer can however an important distinction
3360472 do you really think that we need to draw this
3360473 some people are surprised that asian swimmers have won gold and silver at this olympics
3360474 but at this games i have won gold and silver and weve had zhang lin china win silver so we have shown the world that we can compete we got got medals and were both asian
3360475 i dont know what happened but when i looked back and saw a few smiling faces i realised i had done it
3360476 i went in with a lot of confidence because i had come second in athens but i still had to shoot my best it was a close call but at least it went in my favour
3360477 no longer will a gold medal surprise us never again will we plead with the constellations to allow luck to go our way

3360575 hes been an enigma but we accepted that when we drafted him
3360576 he finished the year with our club and played in the playoffs hes certainly got a chance to make it too
3360577 we think he can be a solid two way physical player
3360578 he would have had more points if houston had used him in offensive situations he had 70 goals his last two years of junior he can score if you put him those situations he can shoot i think hes got a good chance with us
3360579 he had a good season he has an excellent attitude the question with him is whether hell be able to adapt to the nhl tempo hopefully he will
3360580 i think he lost some of his confidence in houston
3360581 we got him in the fernandez trade and he was pretty good in training camp he was our last cut as a forward his play was up and down in houston
3360582 we didnt know what he was we didnt know if he was a center or a winger or offensive or defensive we never really knew the second half of the year he played a lot better hopefully hell give some people a run for their money in camp
3360583 the biggest thing with adrian was that he played a full season for the first time in a long time hes had a whole lot of physical problems if those are behind him i think hes got some talent he has to show what he can do
3360584 i was very surprised were just delighted we have him
3360585 our doctors said he had as athletic a body as any of the prospects hed seen
3360586 this guy is one of these late developers three years ago he was undrafted in the quebec league as a 5 foot 9 140 pound center
3360587 he was the best defenseman on the ice in the games i saw he finished the year with us in the playoffs
3360588 we intend for him to be one of our defenseman this season he has a good solid two way game hes a feisty guy he can shoot from the point hes physical hes a good player
3360589 we liked him at michigan tech hes shown some flashes hes an older guy but hes huge hes strong and powerful are his feet good enough for the nhl i guess well have to find that out its harder for the tough guys to make it on defense in your own end down low you cant use your stick and you cant use your free hand

3360747 as a historian i am only providing a space for discussion debate and discourse any differences in fact should not be a source of confusion but a starting point to revealing the truth
3360748 i am carefully choose the title in search of supriyadi and not this is supriyadi because i know this is only the beginning

3360751 the filthiest thing you could imagine and theres no way i could tell it on tv
3360752 i am complaining about certain shows being taken off the air the incredible hulk is one of the best shows on tv for a long time my family and i looked forward to monday nights to see it when suddenly its taken off the air what is wrong with people in tv they get an original show and then take it off and all we ever see are police or doctor shows or re runs of movies
3360753 being a recuperating stroke case myself i am interested in the case of dr tom horton in days of our lives if he was say 25 when addie was born and addie was 25 when julie was born tom would then be 50 then another 25 years till davids birth makes him 75 as david appears to be about 30 tom would be 105 rather old to be going back to work as a doctor and poor alice is about to have a hysterectomy at about the same age american medicine must be far more advance of ours
3360754 it is difficult to put into words exactly what one feels about a tv show especially one like flashez which used to provide entertainment information or just give us a glimpse at anything interesting although this show was taken from us more than seven months ago i still think about it some people might say the comperes were off their heads i agree but i dont think this is any reason to damn the show anyway i love people who are off their heads

3360756 further observational studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the mechanisms underlying these observations if confirmed randomized clinical trials will be needed to determine whether vitamin d supplementation at higher doses could have any potential benefit in reducing future mortality risk in those with 25 oh d deficiency
3360757 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3360758 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3360759 this is the first study to our knowledge to explore the association between 25 oh d levels and mortality in the general population
3360760 several lines of evidence suggest that vitamin d deficiency may be a risk factor for cardiovascular cancer and all cause mortality
3360761 ecological studies reveal that cvd events are higher in the winter when vitamin d levels are lower and that cancer survival is better if the cancer is diagnosed in the summer when vitamin d levels are higher

3360784 mr rufli has been not only the strong leader but also the engineer who designed and built amari hotels amp resorts to what it is today a professional profitable hotel chain with a diverse mix of international clientele run by a professional team of executives
3360785 dr chaijudh karnasuta and mr giorgio berlingieri the founders of amari group trusted mr rufli with one hotel back in 1972 the nipa lodge hotel pattaya he grew it to 17 hotels with 4 000 rooms nationwide and built a consistent international recognition for amari brand
3360786 so although i am sad to see mr rulfi s departure from the company i would still recognise him as a member of our amari family going forward i hope you will extend the same strong support to his successor mr henley as you have extended to mr rufli all these years

3360788 the new hoteliers are all paper tigers number crunchers very impersonal they come and go we would not even know it those days we talk communicate build relationships solve problems together thats how the industry was run kurt is a shining example of how it was done i am sad these gentlemen are no longer in the industry
3360789 he was a unique boss then and a great friend today from whom i have learned a lot and who helped me in planning my career his achievements are numerous the well recognised brand name of amari today providing the owners of the various properties with more than acceptable bottomline in both good years and bad years of thai tourism and the guts to always employee young executives train them and assist them in their career path after which many of them are able to obtain jobs in various most reputable hospitality companies in the region and beyond

3360791 people deal too much with the negative with what is wrong why not try and see positive things to just touch those things and make them bloom

3360936 in the holy spirit i know you would satisfy every single person in a room if you were the only person present
3360937 plenty of people post under their real names and do not attempt to hide
3360938 meanwhile you are the ugliest pigfucker in the universe you are the
3360939 what a dickless wonder you are snarky you fat asshole
3360940 i am the only one who has outer filthed ward
3360941 when i told abbie hoffman that he was the first one who made me laugh
3360942 a demonstration should turn you on not turn you off
3360943 check the time stamps and come to the same conclusion as i did
3360944 hmm lets find someone who doesnt watch much tv and have them not watch tv
3360945 personally i have dreams of setting up a similar system but supplementing it with a pc based pvr with a couple of ota hdtv cards built in for capturing most of the broadcast shows id need then id only need to download a handful of programs from cable networks like sci fi or hbo keeping the itunes bill nicely below my average 54 monthly cable bill
3360946 im not having problems with money except i have credit card debt that i cant pay down
3360947 my parents always threw great parties so ive always wanted to do the same
3360948 the par bro guys led me upstairs to my bedroom and showed me from above why my plan wasnt the best idea
3360949 i had the same umbrellas installed at my restaurant and realized they would be better for the backyard
3360950 one summer we were inspired by the orange of hermes while this year its more about classic black and white chanel
3360951 i wanted a european feel to the backyard relaxed classic and comfortable
3360952 im happy when someone comes over and i can provide them with their favourite drink or food
3360953 it would remind me too much of the hot tub on the bachelor
3360954 we dont know if the victim is going to pursue the charges anytime there is a domestic allegation the victim is offered an emergency protection order basically a restraining order she declined it she also declined medical treatment
3360955 the victim did have visible injuries and we also believe alcohol was involved that will be part of the investigation
3360956 alan and lesley told me it was all a big misunderstanding and that nothing actually happened in fact lesley wasnt even aware that alan had been arrested hayden found out about her dads arrest when he called her from jail they love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
3360957 two or three times on her left cheek with a closed fist
3360958 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him he sent her a personal message asking her to get on board
3360959 he has always admired her music and thinks she is the perfect choice because of her unique appeal to black and white voters
3360960 she believes he is going to be the first black american president and she is honored to be part of that
3360961 that wasnt a 20 glass of wine you ordered was it
3360962 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3360963 if a woman had 10 years that she stayed at home with her family a traditional assessment would have been that she did nothing in those years
3360964 my assessment was different because i know when i was home with my kids i was active in the schools and community organizations and of course you learn a great deal from bringing up children
3360965 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3360966 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3360967 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3360968 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3360969 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3360970 were going to stop buying silly things like that as opposed to giving up going out for a drink
3360971 cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than many consumer products
3360972 while not immune from the consequences of an economic slowdown we can certainly look to the future with more confidence than most
3360973 the odd bar of chocolate is not going to break the bank
3360974 i always have a piece a day and i cant see that changing
3360975 islam doesnt distinguish between the american people and the american government
3360976 islam does not distinguish between the american people and the american government since both are in a state of war with islam
3360977 though the project was originally estimated to cost n5 5 billion now the projection has changed and for it to meet the next year completion deadline the oopl is going ahead to raise more money to meet the new estimated cost of n9 billion
3360978 more than 30 percent of the project is already completed while the main contractor has been paid over n2 billion for the complex so far
3360979 africa deserves this project it would provide the template for life after power not just for obasanjo but for other presidents this would not only provide repositories for what a president has acquired while in office but also for other historical artefacts and objects that would throw light at the immediacy of power and history of nigeria
3360980 this informed the generous contributions that we have made to the realization of this dream even when many were skeptical and even cynical about its utilitarian value
3360981 we are greatly delighted that our administration is still in office at the commencement of work on the museum component we also stand on the promise of god that our administration will still be in office when the final commissioning of the library takes place

3360994 i am not looking back i am only looking forward
3360995 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3360996 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3360997 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3360998 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3360999 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3361000 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3361001 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3361002 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3361003 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3361004 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3361005 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3361006 i have reached a decision to halt the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3361007 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3361008 the statement on the halt of the military action by russia is the news we had expected its good news
3361009 it is not part of our culture it is not what we do
3361010 the first thing theyll do is stop women from working then theyll force us to wear the veil
3361011 this new vice and virtue movement has the potential to undermine the government
3361012 civil society groups are working hard to modernise society to establish a social contract grounded in our constitution and reflected in our laws a group using religion as a weapon threatens all the progress we have achieved
3361013 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3361014 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3361015 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3361016 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3361017 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3361018 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3361019 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3361020 no hace ni demasiada humedad ni demasiado calor estoy en buena forma
3361021 mr boondoggle this is jeff from a m mortgage co and rates are really low right now how do you feel about saving money on your mortgage
3361022 we can refinance with uh no cash and uh and lock in a rate
3361023 i like provolone cheese cheddar cheese blue cheese and limburger cheese
3361024 damn it jeff i called you because i heard you wanted to talk about cheese
3361025 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3361026 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3361027 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3361028 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3361029 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3361030 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3361031 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3361032 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3361033 ten years in the lbj man youll be climbing the walls
3361034 i felt he really was so committed to that character the guy that was playing that guy that as an audience you bought his sincerity very few people i think could pull that off
3361035 robert was black the whole time my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle
3361036 to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what hes doing is crazy the whole time
3361037 otherwise its just demeaning to brandons character and if its demeaning to an actual black man in the movie i would have run for the hills
3361038 if were all gonna play ball lets all play ball
3361039 i believe in fairness if we can punch you punch back and funny is funny
3361040 this sort of self important self involved thing seemed funny to me
3361041 i just couldnt figure a way to make that into a movie
3361042 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3361043 an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3361044 you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think youre doing of what you think is the right idea
3361045 if people are accepting it the way that you intended and you feel that from a general audience then stand behind it
3361046 i just hope at this point with whatever little weve done to brand ourselves as entertainers that you give us a little slack
3361047 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by zhang yimou here this is actually almost animation a footstep a second 29 in all to signify the 29 olympiads
3361048 we said earlier that aspects of this opening ceremony are almost like cinema in real time well this is quite literally cinematic
3361049 this is a digitally manufactured shot to represent whats happening right now outside the stadium
3361050 the audience makeup of the olympics is very much like that of american idol and dancing with the stars which have live season finales presented in much the same way
3361051 you assume theres a large amount of intelligence in the viewing audience so when they see those twice an hour time stamps theyll understand what is being presented
3361052 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3361053 for example we believe those who have the apple shape pot bellies which tend to be men they have indicators whether it be high blood pressure high cholesterol heart disease
3361054 it is the idea that fat around your belly could be a better indicator rather than just the number on the scale
3361055 always assuming that the situation here must have reflected that in the rest of the united kingdom answers to my questions started to make me realise that my earlier assumptions may not have been totally correct
3361056 when the local defence volunteers the fore runner of the home guard were formed in great britain their formation was not extended to northern ireland in response the inspector general of the royal ulster constabulary offered the northern ireland prime minister the services of the ulster special constabulary to fill the gap and fulfil the role under taken by the ldvs in great britain this resulted in the formation of the local defence volunteers section yes thank you again but its not particularly helpful as its not dated sign in before you can post messages join this group please update your nickname on the yourplace com gt wrote gt gt gt on the other hand and bringing it right back the only only part of the gt gt gt uk gt gt gt where no home guard or ldf was in northern ireland for fear on the part gt gt gt of gt gt gt the local government that arming catholics would not be a desirable gt gt gt outcome gt gt hmm the queens university student rag mag is called ptq one gt gt of the wartime covers showed a pair of armed and uniformed home gt gt guards marching smartly past a couple of scruffy specials with sticks gt gt and a bad case of weapons envy gt gt so i am fairly sure the home guard existed here too gt well eventually they were formally named that but it was largely a gt cosmetic exercise gt in britain the hg were a military organisation under the territorial army gt in northern ireland local defence consisted entirely of b specials a gt police force and in its original guise of the ulster defence volunteers was gt nothing more than a branch of that force to whit the local defence gt volunteers section gt this was then passed unchanged to the control of the ruc and when this gt section was actually renamed as the ulster home guard it was still manned gt by the same cadre of b specials and still a police force gt finally they did come under the direct command of the british army but they gt and their b special parent organisation were used interchangeably in the gt local defence role gt in short a very different organisation to the british home guard and with gt no affiliations with that organisation whatsoever just for the record they the b specials were seen by the british police as an affiliated
3361057 dont confuse us with that lot but if you take another photograph we will take out the film and expose it
3361058 we have a gang shooting on third and main three wounded one dead

3361089 whenever we go in villages a large number of people surround us
3361090 wherever we have a camp we make it a point to carry at least 10 000 to 15 000 saplings each time i keep on telling the farmers that it is their fixed deposit since we are not having a government job and do not have the facility of having a pension after retirement so it is a noble way of warding off poverty and pollution at the same time

3361140 we are pleased with our better than expected fourth quarter results excluding certain items our sequential performance improved significantly with operating income growing roughly 12 while return on capital employed improved by 113 basis points
3361141 in fiscal 2008 our focus on value based management and value creating m amp a resulted in record financial results despite the challenging macro economic forces impacting our markets during fiscal year 2008 we completed seven acquisitions and in early fiscal 2009 we added three more to our portfolio that expanded our geographic coverage and enhanced our competitive position this disciplined acquisition activity combined with a strong operating performance from our global team resulted in a slight improvement in return on capital and economic profit volume year over year we decided to take some targeted corrective actions in the second half of fiscal 2008 but we are also continuing to invest in organic strategies and value creating m amp a that positions avnet for stronger future growth while remaining committed to achieving our long term financial goals
3361142 electronics marketing delivered another solid quarter of year over year revenue growth as its diversified account base and limited exposure to consumer products mitigated some of the macro economic headwinds more importantly our em team has well managed our portfolio of businesses within the current business conditions as evidenced by the consistent year over year increase in quarterly return on capital employed roce throughout fiscal 2008 in the june quarter ems return on capital employed increased 73 basis points over the year ago quarter and for fiscal 2008 this important metric was improved by 117 basis points
3361143 technology solutions rebounded from the disappointing march quarter as double digit sequential growth in servers storage and software along with higher gross margin drove an 88 basis point improvement in operating income margin in the americas region both operating income margin and return on capital employed were at the high end of our long range business model the cost reduction initiatives at certain ts business units that we announced last quarter are essentially complete and we expect the full savings to be realized in the september quarter with the recently completed acquisitions of horizon technologies and ontrack solutions ts is continuing to build out its international footprint while also investing in new organic growth opportunities

3361244 this is a story from the mahabharata the pancha five pandavas were in the forest trying to lift a fruit this was the legendary amrutaphala the fruit of immortality there was a saint sitting there in deep penance the name of the saint was roma rishi roma
3361245 the five pandavas did not notice the hair but they saw the very big fruit which they wanted to pick up and eat the saint had been doing penance for that fruit because whosoever ate that fruit would never feel thirsty or hungry therefore that rishi was doing penance for the procurement of this very fruit the five pandavas came there trying easily to grab that fruit the rishi became disturbed opened his eyes and was very angry ready to curse all the pandavas
3361246 in the meantime krishna came to the rescue of the five pandavas he came to the sage and spoke a few words a few courtesies and kind enquiries then krishna fell at the feet of all the five pandavas then the rishi thought that the five pandavas must be very great people so he too fell at their feet thus his anger was pacified this is an episode which shows that the kindness of god towards his devotees is such that he would not even mind falling at the feet of the devotees

3361339 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way
3361340 the truman committee held 60 hearings on waste fraud and abuse
3361341 its unfathomable to me that we dont have a bipartisan investigative committee on contracting in iraq
3361342 you feel like you need a shower theyre asking you to be certain of things you cant be certain of
3361343 you can feel the release of the tension which normally infects the evidence gathering process
3361344 are able to more effectively respond to the views of the other expert or experts
3361345 umsatz hat nicht generell etwas mit absatz zu tun dass der umsatz geringer ausgefallen ist hat seine ursache darin dass wie im projektgesch ft blich einige vorhaben nicht wie geplant im zweiten quartal umgesetzt werden konnten sondern folglich in das folgequartal gerutscht sind
3361346 while the victim did not require hospital treatment he still sustained injuries as a result of this apparently unprovoked assault and he is understandably shaken by his ordeal
3361347 the three suspects were noticeably drunk and we are appealing for anyone who witnessed the assault or who saw the suspects that evening to get in touch
3361348 in particular we are keen to speak to a couple who tried to help the victim and a woman who was walking with her three children and may have seen what happened
3361349 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3361350 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy recognising the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil
3361351 i am very pleased that this little girl has been identified clearly for kate and gerry it is a disappointment but we have had many of these before and the search for madeleine will continue
3361352 people who deal with the public provide a great service and should be able to go about their work without fear of attack or intimidation
3361353 this rise just confirms what our members have been telling us for months they are facing unparalleled hikes in the cost of basics like milk bread cheese petrol gas and electricity
3361354 the governments unjust public sector pay policy means that teaching assistants nurses librarians care workers home carers nursery staff and hospital cleaners are having to cope with the biggest rise in inflation since records began on a real pay cut
3361355 instead of targeting the public sector workers who keep this country running smoothly the government should turn their firepower on to the big city bonuses and corporate fat cats who are the real villains when it comes to fuelling inflation
3361356 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3361357 food manufacturing for example is being squeezed leading to severe job losses other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3361358 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3361359 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3361360 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3361361 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3361362 i think what you have confirmed here is good news a ceasefire now has to take shape
3361363 the coaches are for those britons who are unable to make their own arrangements to leave the country mainly families with children or the elderly
3361364 this is an elderly lady whos husband she is known to be very very very conservative she our information is 201 that she does not believe in legal actions involving automobile wreck cases and because of that and the fact that her husband is also known to be that way in the community we struck her
3361365 hes known in the fairfax community as a very conservative person and has i dont think i wont say has feelings towards the normal average black person we just dont feel like our plaintiff is a black person who started off low from a nothing to hopefully something and thats what this case is all about we do not feel like he could identify with not one iota of the situation that mr payton finds himself in thats the reason we struck him
3361366 she is known as a very opinionated 16 person your honor who expresses herself we knew if she got on that jury she was not gone sic budge one way or the other that she was gone sic get her way or no way that was our opinion from what we had learned her family has mr lanier has talked about the number of people in trouble she herself has not had any problems but she comes from a family thats had some problems with the law and shes kind of what we refer to as a redneck variety so to speak and that was the reason we struck her and as you also know your honor i was concerned with her family whether she had any problems with me or the law because some members of her family might have problems with the law
3361367 frankly we considered leaving her on this jury because she as far as herself is concerned shes known as a nice person however her husband is in the insurance business and we were concerned that the relationship of husband and wife might be some problems there she is also a registered nurse and its been my experience unfortunately bad experiences with registered nurses on juries thats the reason we struck her
3361368 mr 17 pinckney is a security guard your honor and he we were concerned about what kind of problems he had had with blacks and such in the security business we also understand hes a very very conservative person who is not i wont call anybody a racist but hes got mixed opinions about black people
3361369 is almost always used by whites to describe other whites
3361370 1 a member of the white rural laboring class esp in the southern united states 2 a person who advocates a provincial conservative often bigoted sociopolitical attitude considered characteristic of a redneck
3361371 through all relevant circumstances that the prosecutor intentionally exercised his strike because of racial concerns
3361372 ignores the fact that both jurors were noted as having possible criminal records
3361373 the use of this racial stereotype is evidence of the prosecutors subjective intent to discriminate and clearly violates the mandates of batson

3361384 no doubt this is an impressive complex to me it speaks of the importance of our relations with china
3361385 tonight august 8 the olympic torch will light the home of an ancient civilization with a grand history

3361387 china advanced the frontiers of knowledge in medicine astronomy navigation engineering and many other fields
3361388 we share a long history the first american ship arrived in china just after the year 1783 we won our independence
3361389 today the united states and china have built a strong relationship rooted in common interests china has opened its economy and begun to unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of its people
3361390 america will continue to support china on the path toward a free economy
3361391 the completion of the two new embassies not only reflects the good shape of our relationship but also signals broad prospects for its further growth
3361392 well continue to be candid about our mutual global responsibilities

3361411 environment minister carlos mincs decision to license the dam demonstrates his mandate is to accelerate the implantation of large scale high impact projects in the heart of amazonia the fact that construction will be permitted without a definitive solution in place for fish passage threatens the livelihoods of thousands of river bank dwellers who depend on high value fish species for their income
3361412 this is a serious violation of the human rights of the displaced people
3361413 the project violates the equator principles on project finance and therefore should not be financed by banks such as bradesco banco do brasil ita and unibanco that have committed to the principles brazilian banks have an opportunity to prove that they are truly committed to sustainability by refusing to finance the destruction of the amazon
3361414 we do crime scene investigations on bomb sites conducting post blast analysis to help us combat future attacks and track the ied cells where the deadly weapons originate
3361415 it was a little different coming into this environment dominated by soldiers but we are all here for the same reason to serve our country
3361416 i do a lot of analytical work with the army intelligence guys and really enjoy the things i get to do here plus i get to do something for my fellow servicemembers
3361417 there is no real difference between an airman and a soldier we are all professionals and take our work seriously
3361418 todays settlement demonstrates that the justice department will be vigilant in protecting the medicare program from all who abuse it including contractors that falsely bill for crucial tasks that they do not perform
3361419 the united states relies extensively upon trusted contractors to uphold the integrity of the medicare system within new jersey and any abuse of that trust will be sharply addressed
3361420 fit to fight means being mentally and physically fit to do my job
3361421 a lot of time people are on the road and they get tired but if you make time to work out you will feel much better
3361422 when you work long days youll have more energy because you worked out
3361423 this is great that the air force is putting this race on and allowing us to run by the military planes
3361424 running keeps your body in check keeps your body healthy and helps keep you emotionally stable
3361425 my grandfather was in the air force and when i was little i heard his stories he inspired me to join my ambitions when i was young were to teach and fly planes and now i will get that chance to fulfill my dreams
3361426 every day in america i learn something about america and the american military
3361427 training and being fit is very important and american military leaders stress it and show how much they care about being fit and how much they care about their forces
3361428 all he told me was that higher headquarters wanted to be connected to the pilot for a mission the next day and he called the communications squadron because he couldnt think of anyone else to call
3361429 i terminated a network connection cable inside the headset coming from the wire harness and connected it to the conference call terminations on the circuit board inside a vosip phone
3361430 now we dont need to get on our keyboard to type our request or take our eyes off the screen
3361431 we can just talk to the caoc to receive clearance authority to engage a target or get other updates instead
3361432 with the phone people at the caoc are able to call us and use all the communications capabilities available there to feed us real time support through the headset
3361433 i never would have thought that a three star general would know what i did much less think so highly of it
3361434 on behalf of my family we would like to thank the air force for establishing an equal opportunity award in honor of my father and the many years of dedicated service to the eo community
3361435 it is my understanding this new award is to recognize outstanding eo professionals who exemplified superior leadership in promoting the tenants of equal opportunity diversity and affirmative action it is heartwarming to know this award will be considered the most prestigious award for an eo professional who like my father did the most to advance the air force eo program in a given year
3361436 had tracy been involved in an organ donation as either a donor or a recipient that would have been acceptable to us
3361437 tracy did his best to hide his background from team officials
3361438 our country has a long and varied history of stolen elections systematic disenfranchisement and manufactured election irregularities
3361439 yet most of us still accept on faith the integrity of the election process i hope that watching uncounted so close to the presidential election will shake to the core any preconceived beliefs and encourage immediate action before its too late
3361440 the notion of stolen elections is something we assign to third world countries but not this beacon of freedom and democracy that we like to view ourselves as
3361441 findings from this study suggest the significant role that built environment plays in either positively or negatively impacting our health and or lifestyle
3361442 a major factor in this increase has been the change in cheerleading activity which now involves gymnastic type stunts
3361443 if these cheerleading activities are not taught by a competent coach and keep increasing in difficulty catastrophic injuries will continue to be a part of cheerleading
3361444 this is a huge win for humpback whales and all those who have worked for more than four decades to protect them
3361445 ending commercial whaling was one of the most important conservation victories of the 20th century today our planets great whales face more threats than ever including renewed whaling by japan iceland and norway it is our generations turn to keep these magnificent creatures off the target list forever
3361446 when we act responsibly endangered species begin to recover the humpback and other great whale species may never return to their historic numbers but todays news is very encouraging for all who care about the future of these magnificent creatures
3361447 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3361448 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3361449 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3361450 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3361451 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3361455 maintaining living hedges around agricultural plots and preserving remnant trees in pasture
3361456 fitting coincidence because homo sapiens is now behaving in ways reminiscent of a spoiled teenager
3361457 we know where biodiversity will go from here up in smoke toward the poles and under water into crops and livestock onto the table and into yet more human biomass into fuel tanks into furniture pet stores and home remedies for impotence out of the way of more cities and suburbs into distant memory and history books
3361458 the support system for civilization will be destroyed and the world as we now know it will disappear
3361459 academic ecological papers are often tinseled with one or two sentences about the applied significance of the science which accomplishes little
3361460 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3361461 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3361462 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3361463 oil futures were lower on tuesday extending last nights losses under pressure from the stronger dollar and as news emerged that russia was halting its military operation against georgian troops in a conflict surrounding the breakaway region of south ossetia
3361464 geopolitical concerns always provide good support to oil prices and this news should offer some relief to investors worried about exports of azeri crude from ports in georgia
3361465 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi
3361466 we dont know yet whether it was damaged its a second attempt to bomb this pipeline since august 10
3361467 the pipeline is not operational at the moment anyway because the kurds have blown it up on turkish territory
3361468 the fact also that there is no oil at the moment in the pipeline makes it in a way less vulnerable
3361469 even if a bomb hits it it wont be set on fire because theres nothing to set on fire which means that the damage will much less substantial
3361470 the strong recovery in the dollar adds more pressure to the sector which is already suffering from fears over slowing global growth
3361471 at the same time it emerged today that the iea has raised its demand forecast for 2009 by 70 000 barrels to 87 8 million barrels per day

3361473 there is an immense battle going on in tolkiens world and it is taking place at different levels
3361474 i believe that there are spiritual forces of wickedness that are fighting against the coming of christs kingdom in this place
3361475 they are intent on breaking and destroying all that is good and lovely and true
3361476 pray for the overthrowing of darkness and for the breaking in of christs just and gentle rule
3361477 weve left portishead earlier than we would have done and the wickedness is one of the factors which made me leave the town
3361478 wed been in the town for 12 years and felt that our work here had come to an end
3361479 this was a message of farewell to the church family and not aimed at anyone individual
3361480 i want people to be aware that in this world there is a
3361481 this is a message of concern and love for the people that we loved in portishead to urge them to stand up for what is good lovely and true
3361482 i want to encourage gods people in portishead to stand for and do what is good and lovely and true and to push back evil
3361483 portishead is no different from any other town in this regard there are a lot of good people in portishead working to service the community and their neighbours
3361484 portishead is a fine town with many fine people and is served faithfully by an active and attractive church
3361485 all military bases have valuable assets whether those assets are buildings equipment or personnel
3361486 each base is required to perform antiterrorism vulnerability assessments to identify areas for security improvement due to the size of military bases and the large number of assets they possess this can prove to be a time consuming and difficult task
3361487 to conduct the risk assessments in a less time consuming and more accurate manner researchers developed a database program that assigns standardized numerical values to each asset to each threat to the asset and to each vulnerability allowing an attack against the asset
3361488 the program using these numerical values calculates the risk factors to the installation and ranks them in order from risks that are totally unacceptable and must be reduced to those that are tolerable with this information base commanders can make informed decisions about where to spend money to improve security
3361489 the air force jtac is absolutely our go to guy on the ground to start any mission
3361490 the jtac provides a report with all the essential information we need to employ ordnance his other big piece of the puzzle is making sure we understand the situation on the ground any threats where the targets are deconfliction of artillery
3361491 emergency cas is very rare but we are prepared for the situation
3361492 we train for it in our pre deployment spin up we are very familiar with the steps we need to take to employ weapons around friendlies who are not qualified jtacs
3361493 you have to find out what you have to do to help the guys on the ground
3361494 there is a lot of talking to the guy on the ground and understanding his situation the friendly situation in general and find out exactly what they need
3361495 if the people on the ground are not currently taking contact then you can afford to take more time to develop a plan for the ao
3361496 if they are taking contact then it ratchets it up another notch to employ weapons quickly efficiently and above all safely
3361497 normally a jtac will assume some responsibility he identifies what you are bringing and how you can use it
3361498 in emergency cas the pilot is assuming all the responsibility and risk in weapons deployment
3361499 the enemy doesnt operate in droves like in past conflicts
3361500 its not like we show up and see a mass of people advancing its much more challenging trying to find them in the types of terrain they are dispersed in
3361501 if our presence alone makes the enemy stop shooting that in itself is rewarding
3361502 our saying in the squadron is that its all about the 18 year old with the rifle its not about our ego and having to employ weapons
3361503 the ultimate reward is to be able to help guys that need your help
3361504 when the aircrafts land the pilots dont have to take time to shut down
3361505 the whole team to include maintainers and refueling operators are on scene at least an hour before the aircraft is down
3361506 we dont have radio contact with the pilot but the main crew chief does
3361507 if something were to happen on the pilots gauges he could relay that via radio to the crew chief
3361508 if something goes wrong the response time is a lot quicker
3361509 if you let go of the dead man fuel flow is stopped in less than 30 seconds
3361510 because the hands on training means youre already entering the danger zone we do pre training ahead of time
3361511 before we can even refuel the site and truck being used have to be certified by the majcom
3361512 were getting the personnel spun up now so when the squadron of aircraft comes on scene were ready to go full tilt

3361572 there were about 150 area bands who signed up and viewers voted on who would ultimately make the top 12
3361573 we wound up in that next rank with somewhere between 40 000 and 50 000 votes and the folks at mtv choose us as one of the acts to warm up the atlanta show which was a true honor to be recognized
3361574 christian audiences are awesome but this show was great because it was out of our comfort zone
3361575 we were kind of nervous going into the show but after we were done we realized people are people and they like music period it was really cool to see the same songs and same parts of the show go over just as well with a mainstream audience
3361576 we dont want to be one of these christian bands that goes out there overly protective of who we are but at the same time we want to make sure the message is not preachy or condemning to non believers
3361577 we just told everybody at the end of the set that jesus loves them and wed love the opportunity to meet them which is really when the conversations that have the most impact happen we didnt necessarily get to pray with anyone or lead them to jesus in those few moments but we certainly did everything we could to further his name and let people know he loves them which yielded a really positive response
3361578 i wouldve gone to even darker corners had mamas pride went on that tour
3361579 at that time the only real peace i ever found was when we were on stage but the minute you go backstage and get back into real life if youre not happy with who you are those problems are right there waiting for you when all the applause and encores are over

3361689 the investment bank continues to be negatively affected by the disruption in the credit and mortgage markets as well as by overall lower levels of liquidity and wider credit spreads

3361692 new buyer inquiries continued to fall at the fastest pace in wales and the north and the slowest in london the south east and south west

3361719 jodlowiec lo seguiamo da un anno e contiamo di tesserarlo
3361720 a buon punto ha osservato marino abbiamo centrato il primo obiettivo della stagione cio lingresso in uefa ora tenteremo di andare il pi avanti possibile la gara con gli albanesi del vllaznia non affatto semplice ha sottolineato il dg azzurro allemittente campana come tutte le partite in uefa daltronde pensate che la nosta gara col panionios pi che un turno di intertoto per la caratura dellavversario poteva essere considerato un buon ottavo di finale ludinese in torunee in grecia ha giocato sul campo del paok salonicco che giunto sei posti in classifica dietro il panionios ed stata sconfitta ad ogni modo abbiamo gi salito un altro gradino importante per il futuro gioved proveremo a salirne un altro ancora in campo la squadra albanese cercher di qualificarsi con i mezzi che ha a disposizione il vllaznia colmer con lagonismo il gap tecnico incontestabile che ha nei confronti del napoli
3361721 si vero ha ammesso ci sono stato ed i giornali hanno carpito il nostro lavoro jodlowiec lo seguiamo ormai da un anno e un giocatore che speriamo di riuscire a tesserare la trattativa stata anticipata dai giornali ma non ancora a livello di firma il mercato dellest lo conosciamo bene e lo seguiamo attentamente qualche giocatore ci gi sfuggito allultimo momento per la concorrenza spietata di club inglesi francesi spagnoli e tedeschi tuttavia non ci sfuggono per questioni economiche
3361722 noi abbiamo una opzione per jodlowiec e lassenso del procuratore del giocatore il suo arrivo a napoli indipendente dalla partenza di domizzi al ragazzo polaccoi dobbiamo concedere qualche mese per ambientarsi ha precisato marino arriva senza conoscere la lingua e il campionato italiano da lui non pretendiamo tutto e subito pu arrivare anche se non parte domizzi
3361723 non me lo spiego ha ammesso probabilmente abbiamo sbagliato qualcosa nella comunciazione perch molti pensano che il napoli allultimo minuto se ne debba liberare
3361724 e chiaro che quando necessario forzare un p perch c un obiettivo stagionale appena quindici giorni dopo linizio del ritiro pu succedere che qualche giocatore sia vittima di infortuni ad ogni modo devo fare i complimenti a reja e ai nostri preparatori atletici che ci hanno consentito di vincere le due gare di intertoto dispiace per mannini per lui si poteva fare qualcosa in pi perch ha subito due volte lo stesso infortunio in questo caso abbiamo sbagliato sia noi che il giocatore
3361725 sono contentissimo di lui ha sottolineato il dg trovo piuttosto superficiale e dilettantistico il voler contare quanti gol fa in amichevole o notare gli assist piuttosto che i gol gli assist di denis per bogliacino e hamsik nelle due partite con il panionios valgono quanto un gol ad ogni modo non possiamo valutarlo dalle reti in precampionato il giocatore ha confermato da vicino quello che avevamo visto da lontano e quindi siamo soddisfatti
3361726 dopo linfortunio di rocchi sarebbe giusto da parte di casiraghi chiamarlo altrimenti non ho capito perch hanno portato in cina una riserva quando poteva allenarsi qui con il napoli le convocazioni della nazionale ho parlato con angelo peruzzi inviato da lippi a frosinone e mi ha assicurato che gli osservati speciali del napoli sono maggio blasi e santacroce ritengo che gi sabato prossimo uno di questi sar convocato in prpospettiva sono sotto osservazione tre giocatori del napoli e la cosa mi inorgoglisce se pensiamo che due anni fa eravamo a lanciano

3361733 we remain cautiously optimistic that the year as a whole will be broadly in line with current expectations notwithstanding reduced trading volumes
3361734 however if there are further heavy falls in the uk stock market or significant reductions in the level of interest rates we could see a deterioration in overall revenues
3361735 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
3361736 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy

3361889 its true and important that paul was concerened with the question of the scope of gods saving action in jesus god is not the god of jews alone but of gentiles also yet pauls statements about the scope of divine saving action do not by any means exhaust what he has to say about its content paul does not confine himself to the point that through christ god has brought gentiles within the scope of his covenant people one the one hand god commits himself unconditionally to future saving action on behalf of abraham and the world on the other hand the law sets the divine human relationship on another basis in which divine saving action is conditional on prior human obedience to the commandments see 2 how may genesis and deuteronomy be reconciled the answer for paul is that the law itself declares that its own project is a dead end it teaches that the one who does these things will find life thereby but it also teaches that this quest is doomed to failure

3361908 making stricter the anti conversion law that has increased persecution of christians
3361909 the amendment introduced in the house assembly on friday july 21 requires clergy and prospective converts to notify authorities of the intent to change religion one month before a conversion ceremony in its current form the madhya pradesh freedom of religion act of 1968 requires that notice be sent to the district magistrate within seven days of conversion
3361910 the advance information must state the name and address of the person converting along with the date and venue of the conversion ceremony after which authorities will decide whether the conversion was forced or by allurement
3361911 the penalty for failing to notify the administration remains imprisonment of up to one year or a fine of up to 1 000 rupees us 21 or both presented by state home minister nagendra singh the amendment was passed by a voice vote without discussion
3361912 this violates the fundamental right of the people as it is the government which would decide if a person can be converted or not indira iyengar member of the madhya pradesh minorities commission told compass she questioned the necessity of the amendment
3361913 despite the fact that numerous cases have been lodged against christians on charges of conversion not even a single person has been convicted by a court of law she said
3361914 he came to his own but his own received him not
3361915 frequently hindu extremists have invoked the states anti conversion law as a means of inciting mobs against christians or having them arrested without evidence
3361916 obviously the life of christians has become miserable at the hands of miscreants in connivance with the police they noted in their report
3361917 among other incidents of christians arrested under the anti conversion law last october a christian worker was jailed in indore madhya pradesh after members of the dharma raksha samiti drs or religious protection committee a hindu extremist group surrounded the heera nagar police station protesting conversions

3361982 commissioned from private israeli security firms several hundred military advisers estimated at up to 1 000 to train the georgian armed forces in commando air sea armored and artillery combat tactics they also have been giving instruction on military intelligence and security for the central regime tbilisi also purchased weapons intelligence and electronic warfare systems from israel these advisers were undoubtedly deeply involved in the georgian armys preparations to conquer the south ossetian capital friday
3361983 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations
3361984 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israel s oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3362069 could inflict far more damage to national security than soviet spies
3362070 investigators suspect espionage is probable as she produced highly sensitive health hazard documents for toxic compounds and chemical pesticides tehseen also was an expert in parasitology as it relates to public water systems
3362071 there is no escaping the unfortunate fact that muslim government employees in law enforcement the military and the diplomatic corps need to be watched for connections to terrorism
3362072 in this case it was not the police that were setting mr read up to entice mr read to come over here to have sex with what he thought was a 15 and a 17 year old girl
3362073 in my experience ive never encountered this where an estranged wife has been the one that set up the sting
3362074 he acknowledged that he came over based on the text messages that were sent to him to have sex with a 15 and 17 year old girl
3362075 below the sanctuary in the fellowship hall a banner for slavery reparations proclaimed they owe us fliers recounted herbert daughtrys arrest a few weeks earlier as he led marchers protesting the not guilty verdict in the police killing of sean bell an unarmed black man his ministry has always combined consuming spirituality with black liberation theology the theology jeremiah wright invoked this spring to defend his controversial sermons and zealous political activism leah holds these forces within her
3362076 while the media hounded wright for his anti american rants and while presidential hopeful sen barack hussein obama divorced him as his personal pastor obamas head will be crowned by leah daughtry who ardently believes in the same marcist black liberation theology preached by wright
3362077 we are thrilled to have leah daughtry leading our 2008 democratic convention team
3362078 i am honored to be a part of this exciting endeavor
3362079 like wright daughtry is in your face about her activism thats why i work in politics my family were activists she described herself to thehill com in may 2007
3362080 have you been to our conventions music and waving and happiness its perfect
3362081 some would say with marxist momma in the top job its little wonder why barack obama is the dncs golden boy coming to denver with mainstream media garnered rock star status
3362082 is leading the democratic partys new mission to make religious believers particular ardent christian believers view the party and its candidates as receptive to and often impelled by the dictates of faith
3362083 daughtrys mission directed from within democratic headquarters in washington and the convention offices in denver is essential to transforming the partys reputation so e terri lavelle an evangelical who said within a few minutes of our sitting down to talk on the last saturday in february 1973 i accepted the lord jesus christ as my savior has traveled to evangelical events around the country seeking to strike up relationships with leaders like the megachurch pastors rick warren and joel hunter and hoping that at the very least the partys new attention and respect its desire to listen and engaged with evangelical issues including abortion is recognized
3362084 god allows us to choose in the biggest matter whether to accept him in our lives how then can we take away choice on other profound issues
3362085 she didnt put any distance between herself and the book a black theology of liberation
3362086 at the basis of black liberation theology is the understanding that god has a special place in his heart for those at the bottom of the ladder
3362087 this type of behavior from an elected official is simply unacceptable
3362088 but this is the attitude that many in the majority party have towards the little people who come to sacramento to participate in the legislative process even when our staff is belittled publicly by arrogant lawmakers we have never been cursed at this is beyond the pale
3362089 the legislative process is supposed to encourage citizen involvement and input
3362090 treating citizens with such disdain by crudely attacking them for sharing their opinion will enforce the public belief that many elected officials are elitists who could care less about their constituents
3362091 this was a public attack and it deserves a public apology
3362092 sen wiggins should be ashamed of her outrageous outburst and we demand a public apology to pastor jones
3362093 we just simply invite the committee to have people from the community that can speak to those issues in a way that will certainly bring their voices to the table i think we partner with you as representatives of the community and of the people in our commitment to better serve the people
3362094 let me step in here we very much appreciate your presence here today youre right the community should be part of the discussions
3362095 the receptionist told me that i had the wrong attitude then she began to lecture me when i wouldnt let her do so she hung up on me clearly the folks in sacramento think that theyre above us
3362096 i called sen wiggins office and was accused of being sexist because i called for a public apology to the people of the state of california for sen wiggins use of profanity and apparently i have never complained about any of the male senators using profanity the ca state government is out of control
3362097 it is an honor to serve the residents of the 2nd senate district which includes portions or all of six counties humboldt lake mendocino napa solano amp sonoma
3362098 the marketing of evil how radicals elitists and pseudo experts sell us corruption disguised as freedom
3362099 hello thank you for seeing my patient now what the heck did you write
3362100 while it would no doubt be an oversimplification to say that u s military action in the balkans in the 1990s was motivated solely by energy resource considerations it might be just as wrong to assume that such considerations played only a minor role
3362101 an extra million pounds is amazing the partnership has been a fantastic success and we would like to thank the people who have donated all the great clothes that helped us raise this money please keep bringing them in as the extra money raised will help oxfam to make a real difference to the lives of many thousands of the worlds poorest people
3362102 pcs are the hidden energy hogs of the home and most users have no idea that they are needlessly throwing away 80 percent of their pcs energy
3362103 if just 1 percent of all pcs used edison we could potentially reduce environmental impacts by 7 billion pounds of co2 which is equal to taking more than a half million cars off the road by finding ways to embed offsets in our daily life even something as simple as downloading software we will create permanent reductions in energy use and have a huge impact on our environment and resource sustainability
3362104 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security
3362105 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attack withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world world history is often made in remote obscure countries it is being made in georgia today it is the responsibility of the leading nations of the world to ensure that history continues to be a record of humanitys progress toward respecting the values and security of free people
3362106 were following closely the violations of the regional equilibrium by hezbollah and syria and the strengthening beyond the fence
3362107 we live in a country in which security is made up not only of tanks and planes but also of the fostering of excellence education and welfare in a country like ours we do not have the luxury to harm the defense budget
3362108 james rubin admits that the us considered the kosovo liberation army and the bosnian muslims allies why what motive does the us have for picking these bums as pals
3362109 in a recent opinion piece in the new york times jacob heilbrunn and michael lind of the new republic editorial staff argue that the american commitment to the islamic connection is so strong that the us design is to make the islamic world part of a new american empire and that american support of the bosnian muslims is part of the implementation of this plan
3362110 general george joulwan the american commander in chief of nato told the washington post that natos actions in bosnia are not about the future of bosnia but the future of europe i think this is true bosnia is a test case for the new american designed security architecture for europe if it achieves all american goals here at little or no cost to us then it will be applied elsewhere and it doesnt take much imagination to predict where
3362111 under clintons policy bosnia will continue to be our responsibility for the rest of the century and beyond this is a much broader and deeper commitment than what the american people realize it runs far beyond mere peacekeeping administration officials have looked far and wide for somewhere to implement these notions total systematic restructuring of a society bosnia is their new laboratory providing a larger scope for experimentation than either somalia or haiti
3362112 administration officials have looked far and wide for somewhere to implement these notions bosnia is their new laboratory
3362113 the strategic goal is to turn bosnia herzegovina into the main american military base in europe and transfer the u s forces now stationed in germany there the confirmed contract value 1 3 billion to build military barracks and latrines at tuzla in the moslem part of bosnia is far too big to relate to the 20 000 american troops presently in bosnia and supposed to be evacuated from there in early 1997 nor is it likely that so much american money is being invested to build barracks for german or other european forces so the transfer of u s ground forces now stationed in germany to bosnia is by far the most reasonable assumption especially since germany has been pressing for their evacuation regarding them as an unwelcome reminder of its defeat and occupation in world war ii
3362114 about 4 860 us troops or roughly 77 percent of americans deployed in kosovo are based here in what is in effect a 775 acre city being built at a cost of 32 million among the hills near the town of urosevac
3362115 it is an obvious sign that the americans are making a major commitment to the balkan region and plan to stay said a senior british officer
3362116 gis are virtual prisoners and never allowed to leave the base because the leaders know that if they did they would be prime targets
3362117 they have dubbed the base disneyland and suggest the concentration of so many soldiers in a single isolated location will hinder their ability to perform peacekeeping tasks this was a wheat field said maj jimmie kenan the hospitals chief nurse now its a metropolis
3362118 with the middle east increasingly fragile we will need bases and fly over rights in the balkans to protect caspian sea oil
3362119 when you cant understanding why something is being done follow the money
3362120 it is possible to see europe as a haven of civilisation with the pincer movement of islam on one side and the us on the other
3362121 it is possible to see europe as a haven of civilisation
3362122 give an idiot a bit of an education and posted by carnwarth on

3362164 youre the transfer from hayama right im col abe natsumi most people call me col nacchi though well anyway youll be assigned to assist the leader of c platoon theyre a unique bunch of soldiers their barracks are right over there by those trees go introduce yourself and get comfortable
3362165 uh excuse me pvt okai where is your commanding officer at
3362166 yes maam im sergeant first class umeda erika reporting for duty
3362167 im 1st lieutenant yajima maimi you are from camp hayama right what did you do there sergeant
3362168 well maam i was in a supply unit for the past 9 years and decided to join the infantry so i could actually fight instead of carry boxes all day
3362169 those girls out there are a real fighting bunch some of them fought in the war in hokkaido a few year ago remember that mess sgt
3362170 i sure do i only helped send supplies to the frontlines though the closest i got to hokkaido was a supply depot in aomori prefecture
3362171 well anyway go put up your stuff and introduce yourself
3362172 now this lady beside me is your new platoon sergeant sgt umeda you will give her your full attention when she asks and i will not tolerate you giving her backtalk if i hear about any disrespect expect my boot in your face
3362173 sorry for not listening to you earlier sergeant i guess well have to get used to you by the way cpl arihara kanna at your service
3362174 ive been here for 30 minutes and already a fight
3362175 guess i gotta break this up i did like back in hayama
3362176 shut up little kid before i knock you back to wherever town you came from
3362177 with all due respect sarge i can knock you into the stone age
3362178 no ordinary supply soldier has that kind of skill sarge
3362179 it was ok what are you doing out here lt yajima maam
3362180 dont be so formal all the time just call me maimi or lieutenant or just yajima or something like that
3362181 no problem anyway i like to come out here sometimes and just think not many people come over here to this lookout and so itsusually pretty quiet
3362182 see that town all the way down there thats aki
3362183 it is the only way to get there from up here on this mountain is by helicopter or by driving down a long crooked path
3362184 when i think about how little it looks from here it inspires me
3362185 anyway i think about how if aki wasnt down there then this would be a pretty lonely place makes you think about how far away from home you are so to change the subject did you read the platoon sergeants manual before you came here
3362186 you have to learn each of the specialties of the people under your command
3362187 youll learn platoon cs specialties after i wake them up real quick hold on for a second
3362188 this isnt 300 guys stop trying to act like spartans
3362189 cpl arihara kanna im the platoons cameraman i tape all the missions that we go on so the cos know that were not playing around all the time im also able to use a shotgun
3362190 im pfc suzuki airi new sarge but people call me kappa im a machine gunner

3362193 im cpl nakajima saki sarge im the main rifleman in this platoon i can take apart a rifle and put in back together in 45 seconds but i like to use the sub machine gun most the time

3362195 kanna let go of me im gonna kill that kid
3362196 well go do morning execises and then well eat breakfast
3362197 you should try to get leave or something so you can stop complaining about this food all the time
3362198 i cant let one of my soldiers be attacked like that
3362199 oh youre the new platoon crappy sergeant huh im sgt tanaka part of the deadly aces squad
3362200 if youre gonna defend this idiot then youre gonna get beat just like her
3362201 you you got a hit what am i gonna do this this aint over new meat okai ill be coming back for you have my money next time
3362202 theyre a 4 member gang who are all combat vets of the hokkaido conflict they go around beating up people and stealing money and food they usually end up beating to a pulp anyone who opposes them
3362203 but you made one of them give up though which is pretty cool
3362204 the other 3 members are stronger than her and once she tells the others theyll be all over you like a dog on a porkchop
3362205 once you make one mad you have to deal with the others
3362206 could we stop talk about those aces for one day
3362207 no im gonna go to the bar a get some drinks wanna come sato
3362208 are you stupid of course i did no one humiliates me like that in public
3362209 im gonna make sure that you die and okai will never refuse to give me money again
3362210 if youre gonna fight me tanaka then fight me hand to hand like a honorable person does or if you wanna play dirty ill make sure youll never be able to hold a pole again
3362211 ok if thats the way you wanna die so be it
3362212 besides i dont want to get the mps here you know how they like to ask everyone a billion questions
3362213 im an ace and aces always have a special move that only we know about
3362214 man that hurt like crap no ones ever countered the diamond drill before are you even human
3362215 you have a broken arm and a busted nose now do you really wanna keep going with this
3362216 ill get you back for this im gonna kill you and your platoon ill tell my friends once my friends here about this youre dead
3362217 that goes for all of you too were gonna make sure all of you die especially you okai im gonna get all that money your family keeps sending you
3362218 im not scared of you tanaka if you even get close to me sarge will break your face right sarge

3362224 so youre a rich girl huh never told us this before
3362225 they run a chain of music stores they have stores from sapporo to okinawa
3362226 when i first joined up no one knew about my connections but when word suddenly got out those aces were on my back for the money that my parents send me every month
3362227 well dont worry about them pvt they wont ever touch that money as long as were here
3362228 now lets get some sleep being with this idiot today made me tired
3362229 i told you that i didnt know that guy was that serious about dance dance revolution
3362230 yeah aces dont get beat up did you have to use your special move
3362231 well i guess i gotta clean up your mess for you tanaka
3362232 if i cant beat her i know you can michishige oh yeah i forgot when you beat her get that okai kids money for me too
3362233 hey sato hold my drink for me im about to try to get a high score on ddr
3362234 whose high score are gonna try to beat yours you know youre the only one to play that dumb game
3362235 ehhhh its alright it isnt as busy as hayama i remember there always a line to the bathroom even at night
3362236 well about 3 months ago mjr yaguchi one of the head officers on base thought there were enemies coming out of the toliets because she heard a strange noise coming from her personal bathroom she ordered all soldiers on base to grab a gun and defend every bathroom to the last man turns out that strange noise was just creaky pipes
3362237 but she still stuck to the story that there were enemies in the toliets
3362238 have any of you seen a girl named u ume umeda
3362239 you better tell me who you are before i beat your face in
3362240 im the ace of clubs i am officially im sgt michishige sayumi
3362241 a bunny of death whats next a poodle of pain
3362242 youre okai are you tanakas told me so much about you she has strange i thought you would be cuter
3362243 after im done with umeda here im coming for you so i wouldnt be laughing right now
3362244 this i was in south sapporo in the last year of the war a terrorist shot a racket launcher towards my position and the explosion burned my face and neck
3362245 but i still managed to be the cutest patient in the hospital how lucky for me right
3362246 whats with this cuteness stuff are you gonna fight me or not
3362247 you know i was never good with punches kicks are more my style
3362248 did you know that clubs are associated with war thats why this special move is called the kicks of war
3362249 maybe if i can somehow grab her legs i can shut her down
3362250 well ok then you were starting to get on my nerves anyway
3362251 im so so sorry for all the trouble i caused
3362252 yeah im ok she just got a lucky shot thats all
3362253 yeah shes probably just knocked out lets get out of here
3362254 hey you guys whos gonna pay for all this stuff
3362255 aww man i guess do ill do it later this week
3362256 normally i wouldnt allow food in the barracks but youre lucky i like yakiniku and the fact that youre kind of cute well i fulfilled my yuri moment of the day hahaha
3362257 anyway when we get inside give me a piece of that stuff will you
3362258 did you leave a egg salad sandwich in there again chisa
3362259 that only happened once little kid and i just forgot to throw it away thats all
3362260 umeda read as the rest of the platoon crowded around her
3362261 and this girl sounds pretty weirder than my grandmas chickens after i put hot sauce in their food
3362262 lets just hope that shes defeated quickly like last time
3362263 hey airi chan is this you guys new sergeant i havent properly met her yet
3362264 im staff sergeant tsugunaga momoko sergeant of platoon b you can call me momo or tsugu chan or whatever you feel like new friend
3362265 was that you who beat up sgt michishige in that bar a few days ago
3362266 i watched you two fight congrats on beating her by the way if i remember the order correctly you have to fight kamei next right
3362267 yep using lovey dovey stuff and adding random lyrics from love songs just like always
3362268 cute girl but a little on the crazy side anyway it seems she neglected to tell you about the lucky 30
3362269 the lucky 30 whats that sounds like a reality show
3362270 no its not a reality show but it does sound like one doesnt it anyway theyre 30 soldiers that kamei san pays to protect her
3362271 the leader is a very cute girl named cpl mano youll usually find her by kameis side
3362272 yeah shes really powerful she might look small but i heard she took on 5 people at once and won thats probably why kamei hired her
3362273 or maybe she hired her because they were best friends i forget why sometimes
3362274 wait i got a idea what if i train all of you to fight with me
3362275 and ill check with my captain and see if platoon b can help you
3362276 wait why are you gonna try to help us momo the aces havent attacked you have they
3362277 but they attacked some of my friends and i hate seeing my friends sad so i want to stop them from hurting any more people
3362278 want me to go with you to talk to your captain
3362279 and bring that bag of yakiniku the captain loves food
3362280 come on open the door or ill kick it open
3362281 well im sfc umeda erika maam me and platoon c are about to fight the ace of hearts and need some help with the lucky 30
3362282 so let me guess you want b to help you fight the 30 right
3362283 give me some of that food and ill help you
3362284 this smells good alright meet me at the gym tomorrow afternoon and well train together thanks for the snack
3362285 so what are we gonna be doing pushups or situps
3362286 were gonna run around the camp 4 times thats about 2 miles
3362287 wait first of all two miles were not training for the olympics lady
3362288 im cpl natsuyaki miyabi main rifleman of platoon b punk
3362289 and were gonna run 2 miles to build up our endurance got that
3362290 but you better not make me mad punk i didnt wake up at 6am to deal with people like you i came to train
3362291 then were gonna practice some different fighting styles after that i think captain might tell us more about the lucky 30
3362292 team it looks like we have a full day ahead of us so lets get this all done and then ill go get us some pizza
3362293 i cant think run and food at the same time
3362294 ok for those of you who dont know this is pfc tokunaga chinami and we are gonna teach you different fighting styles
3362295 wait tokunaga you mean the same tokunaga who won the yokosuka fighting tournament a few years back
3362296 youre ume chan from camp hayama i never thought i see you again
3362297 oh yeah sorry tokunaga and i fought in the yokosuka fighting tournament about 3 years ago she won 1st and i won 2nd
3362298 yeah after that we went back to our separate bases and lost contact because someone didnt tell me that they changed their number
3362299 it was an accident i just forgot to call and tell you
3362300 yeah sure anyway im gonna teach you guys the art of karate which is my fighting style first you get into the fighting stance like this make sure it isnt showy
3362301 then you punch like huu and then like haa ok then you try
3362302 these moves can break arms and legs if you use them right
3362303 hey umeda why dont you show them your fighting style miss 2nd place fighter
3362304 why dont we go eat something my stomachs killing me
3362305 i cant wait to eat i cant remember the last time i ate
3362306 so captain why dont you tell us more about the lucky 30
3362307 im sure that momo told you that cpl mano leads the 30 right
3362308 ok then that saves breath anyway the 30 is divided into 3 groups
3362309 10 use stealth attacks 10 use assault attacks and 10 use swords
3362310 trust me ive seen these guys they are not by any means normal the last person to fight them was never heard from again
3362311 me too but hopefully beating these guys will be perfect revenge for her
3362312 pvt ishimura thought she could take on kamei mano and the lucky 30 at the same time she never got close to kamei because the lucky 30 attacked her first she bravely fought them beating at least 10 of them but the other 20 overwhelmed her and she disappeared
3362313 we dont know what they did to her after that but considering that the 30 are pretty psycho we assumed the worst
3362314 they usually hear about everything that goes on around here
3362315 the 30 operate secretly by day theyre normal soldiers and by night theyre basically assassins
3362316 you could say that but theyre more like new age ninjas
3362317 well need some more training before we take them on
3362318 but if all goes right we can beat them on our first try
3362319 i just wanna get them and the aces out of here by the way how do you know so much about these guys anyway captain
3362320 after ishimura disappeared i tried to get all of the info i could about the 30
3362321 luckily there was an ex 30 member here in town who knew about them he said that they find the craziest people on base when they need positions filled but talking about those guys is making me hungry is the food coming
3362322 lets make it quick though these sweaty socks are killing me
3362323 i can feel the tension in the air but this is a family show so stop fighting or ill hit you
3362324 oh yeah this is a picture of a policeman after my grandma got finshed with him
3362325 we can get in there beat em up and get out
3362326 they probably expect us to come during to the day
3362327 wait a second shimizu dont we have to go to the officers party tonight
3362328 dont worry ill just say we both have a cold
3362329 if we can beat them we might find out what happened to ishimura
3362330 hold on ms yokosuka fighting champion we cant just run into a battle like that
3362331 we dont know what they planned for us out there someone throw a can or something out there
3362332 we are the assault team of the lucky 30 and weve been expecting you guys now prepare to die
3362333 there are supposed to be 30 people here where are the other 20 guys
3362334 you know i wouldnt be making empty threats if i was in your situation
3362335 yeah i would be begging for forgiveness like a boyfriend that got caught cheating
3362336 i just turned on a bomb in the old locker rooms the hostage in there will be dead in 5 minutes try to get her if you dare
3362337 they didnt feed me and they tried to make me into one of them
3362338 now that your bomb has failed what are you gonna do
3362339 well did he tell anything important while we were gone
3362340 yeah he said the rest of the 30 are about to set this whole base on fire
3362341 hello police someones about to set the whole camp on fire

3362380 i saw in a newspaper last week that seven households stand to lose their houses because they have defaulted on their loan repayments
3362381 why should my money lie with the gipf while i stand to lose my house over a couple of ten thousands how can i live poor and without a house if i have more than enough vested in the gipf pension scheme
3362382 however usually remedial action is taken before it reaches the point where the bank has to take legal action against the client
3362383 changes in the bank rate induce commercial banks to also change their rates for example prime lending rate in the same direction and through that the bon is able to regulate the supply of money to the end user both individuals and businesses
3362384 increased interest rates might be painful in the short term but one should bear in mind that in the long run the intention is to cushion consumers from higher inflation which has a tendency of eroding their incomes the flip side of the coin is that higher interest rates provide opportunities to depositors or savers to earn better returns on their investments
3362385 this is in line with the needs of the client and his her repayment ability
3362386 the gipf as a fund was not established to provide solutions to home loans but rather to provide solutions for retirement
3362387 the moment you open up the pension savings to be used somewhere else without due consideration people can end up using their pension monies and by the time of retirement they would sit with nothing left to lay their hands on
3362388 and if you give the loan at a below market rate will you be addressing the plight of people in need
3362389 although that has to be done within the parameters of the act stakeholders still have to agree how this is to be implemented

3362432 the threats of recession are worsening although it is difficult for the bank of englands monetary policy committee to consider rate cuts while inflation is rising it should not hesitate to cut rates later in the autumn once it is clear inflation has peaked

3362464 do they want a situation like many countries have faced
3362465 the sri lanka army has made a lot of progress in the last few weeks but even if they win the battle i am not sure they will win the war i think they havent got the tamil population on their side
3362466 i know the sri lankan government will be unhappy at this advice but we are not interested in preaching to them and that is the best advice they could get india can give this advice better than the norwegians or any other country
3362467 these are people that we know we understand do they want a situation like many countries have faced
3362468 obviously the tamil tigers have been weakened they have met with heavier casualties than previously
3362469 what the sri lankans are not factoring in is the great deal of sullenness in the tamil man there are accusations of profiling even in colombo
3362470 our argument is unless you give tamils a feeling they have the right to their own destiny in many matters you will not succeed lttes capacity to carry out terrorist attacks is not diminished
3362471 although it is known that support for the tigers is rising in tamil nadu the amount of support for the banned outfit revealed in a survey conducted by a media group which is considered respected for its neutrality is quiet stunning

3362477 a racist a racist is one who is both privileged and socialized on the basis of race by a white supremacist racist system
3362478 reverse racism a term created and used by white people to deny their white privilege those in denial use the term reverse racism to refer to hostile behavior by people of color toward whites in the u s there is no such thing as reverse racism
3362479 a non racist a non term the term was created by whites to deny responsibility for systemic racism to maintain an aura of innocence in the face of racial oppression and to shift responsibility for that oppression from whites to people of color called blaming the victim
3362480 while i believe that recent press accounts misrepresent the purpose of the residential life program at the university of delaware
3362481 there are questions about its practices that must be addressed and there are reasons for concern that the actual purpose is not being fulfilled it is not feasible to evaluate these issues without a full and broad based review
3362482 what possessed uds administration to create such a program and what did they hope to accomplish
3362483 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3362484 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3362485 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3362486 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3362487 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3362488 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3362489 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3362490 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3362491 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3362492 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3362493 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3362494 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3362495 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

3362514 aunque fallamos la ltima posesi n hay que estar contentos de haber empatado para forzar la pr rroga tal y como hab a ido el partido era un buen resultado para nosotros

3362520 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3362521 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3362522 my way of improving on it is to keep it up

3362529 hij was dronken en verwond aan zijn voorhoofd hij vertelde dat hij net twee inbrekers had betrapt en van hen een tasje had kunnen afpakken voor ze vluchtten
3362530 hij gaf me zijn naam en adres en zette zelfs opzettelijk vingerafdrukken op mijn raam achteraf bleken de gegevens niet te kloppen en er geen bruikbare afdrukken op mijn ruit te staan hij moet dus zelf de dader geweest zijn ik snap niet dat hij minuten koelbloedig tegen mij bleef praten en zelfs niet bewoog toen ik de politie ging bellen

3362560 i think people from watching the simple life where i was playing this airhead rich brat kind of character years later people still picture me like that even though im completely different from that
3362561 just getting a role like this is huge for me because i always get offered the same role basically playing myself but this is different i had loads of auditions to do for singing and dancing and acting luckily i nailed them all

3362576 parecer a que el mundo les hace todo m s f cil pueden acceder f cilmente a todo tipo de objetos por ejemplo un celular y tienen la ilusi n de que todo es as necesitan saber cu les son los l mites
3362577 es cierto que la b squeda de libertad no es un concepto nuevo pero ahora se nota que los j venes internet de por medio creen que todo es m s accesible especialmente los objetos de consumo soportar sacrificios y dar tiempo a las cosas no parece estar contemplado
3362578 el mundo del trabajo se modific sustancialmente cambiaron sus reglas de juego y la flexibilizaci n laboral contribuye activamente a la precarizaci n del empleo esto genera temores acerca de la imposibilidad de pensar un lugar en el futuro o la amenaza de p rdida de los lugares alcanzados
3362579 tienen la idea de lo que ven en televisi n o les cont un familiar y conocen menos a n sobre las nuevas carreras por ejemplo muchos dicen que como quieren viajar eligen la carrera de turismo como si eso les garantizara que van a viajar
3362580 el rol del orientador es brindar t cnicas y actividades a cada consultante para que busque dentro de s contin a es acercar informaci n para investigar la realidad ocupacional a fin de ir construyendo su perfil ocupacional en el marco de su proyecto personal
3362581 llegan m s informados y decididos sobre la carrera eso es en parte gracias a internet se preocupan por buscar informaci n sobre la carrera
3362582 tambi n vienen algunos padres porque quieren conocer el ambiente donde estar su hijo pero son los menos los chicos son m s independientes y toman las responsabilidades
3362583 eso se nota mucho en las familias hay una ca da general en lo que ata e a la autoridad del padre de familia pero alguna ley deber a funcionar para ayudar a los j venes en el camino por seguir aunque los padres cada vez trabajan m s deber an tener tiempo para impartirla
3362584 es bueno que los j venes tengan experiencias como pasant as charlas informativas y encuentros con profesionales que los puedan ayudar a entender qu es lo que har n en su carrera

3362605 the manager is far from universally adored although the picture painted by the media would suggest he is
3362606 the latest results confirm that his ratings have continued to fall even supporters of his own party now have a negative opinion of him
3362607 miliband was once labour supporters favourite politician with a rating of 9 on 24th july but as speculation about his leadership ambitions increased his rating has dramatically dropped
3362608 6th august was the first day on which he first received a negative net approval rating from the labour supporters on the panel 2 his rating has since decreased further to 5
3362609 the foreign secretarys rating from labour supporters has dropped so much that he is currently below gordon brown 2 the man he would replace as well as jack straw 3 a possible rival for the leadership

3362613 hay significativos avances en la persecuci n del delito de incendio forestal que invita a pensar que estamos ante el comienzo del fin de la impunidad con la que actuaban los incendiarios
3362614 no hay que acostumbrarse a que se desconozca el origen del 40 por ciento de los incendios que se producen o que s lo se juzgue a uno de cada mil incendiarios
3362615 en especial el castigo a los responsables de los grandes incendios forestales debe ser ejemplarizante para evitar que estos se produzcan

3362623 the approval and implementation will be in line with section 173 3 of the constitution of the federal republic of nigeria on the part of the board we want to assure pensioners that once the approval is given and funds are released the increments will be implemented immediately
3362624 we want to therefore confirm that all medically boarded ex soldiers that have turned up for documentation are receiving their monthly pension this payment was however not without some challenges as we had an enormous number of ex soldiers who are either not qualified because they left voluntarily or were dismissed from service trying to be registered
3362625 they either fake dismissed personnel or those that do not qualify for pensions we intend to liaise with the fcda in finding a permanent solution to this category of fake pensioners
3362626 the ex soldiers should not be encouraged to remain in abuja by giving them aims or food as is being done by some individuals or organizations if they are genuine they should be directed to the board to resolve their problems

3362647 there is a strong drift toward the hard theological left some emergent types want to recast jesus as a limp wrist hippie in a dress with a lot of product in his hair who drank decaf and made pithy zen statements about life while shopping for the perfect pair of shoes in revelation jesus is a prize fighter with a tattoo down his leg a sword in his hand and the commitment to make someone bleed that is a guy i can worship i cannot worship the hippie diaper halo christ because i cannot worship a guy i can beat up i fear some are becoming more cultural than christian and without a big jesus who has authority and hates sin as revealed in the bible we will have less and less christians and more and more confused spiritually self righteous blogger critics of christianity

3362746 so then just a you received christ jesus as lord continue to live in him
3362747 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3362748 for the pc version we are planning on uploading some additional pc only challenge rooms via a free patch so you will get more bang for your buck
3362749 so dont you think you need to blog something again soon
3362750 why are you cast down o my soul and why are you in turmoil within me hope in god for i shall again praise him my salvation and my god my soul is cast down within me therefore i remember you
3362751 by making it appear indian with references to hindu scriptures and great poets people will not come to the truth this is a complete turn back from the real bible
3362752 i am sure this bible made in india and for indians will bring the word of god closer to millions of our people not only christians
3362753 work alone is your proper business never the fruits it may produce
3362754 it will take some time for the new bible to gain acceptance
3362755 it has proved to be extremely popular among the christian community with over 15 000 copies sold out within barely 10 days now it has gone for a reprint
3362756 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
3362757 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
3362758 while some christian voters seem to be questioning their early support for obama the mccain candidacy does not seem to be gaining momentum among evangelicals
3362759 since june the current level of support sen mccain has among evangelical voters has declined significantly dropping from 78 percent to 61 percent
3362760 slowly coming to grips with what an obama presidency might be like
3362761 as the finer points of a wide range of issues are clarified by each nominee the initial excitement about senator obama has lost some luster to an increasing number of people whose vote is influenced by their spiritual perspectives
3362762 if sen mccain converts such apprehensions into votes this will be a closer race than many have anticipated
3362763 russian president dmitry medvedev ordered a halt to russias offensive in georgia saying military action achieved the countrys goals
3362764 on the basis of your report i have made a decision to stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3362765 whenever hotbeds of resistance and other aggressive plans emerge make the decision and eliminate them
3362766 the aggressor has been punished and sustained very serious losses
3362767 ok everyone its time to give final approval to the submitted grant requests so if you could all come to order well go over what we have an make sure were all in agreement
3362768 first up we have family counselling and support services for guelph wellington they say they will be using the money to improve services for child victims of sexual abuse all in favour
3362769 very well next up is the volunteer centre of guelph wellington whos goal is to create a community based leadership program certainly sounds laudable all in favour
3362770 third on the agenda for today is the kidsability centre for child development theyre looking for funding to enable them to train camp staff to integrate children with disabilities into their programs this should be easy all in favour
3362771 and finally we come to thats strange how did this get in here guelph symphony orchestra 10 000 to purchase orchestral music for their library preposterous ok jokes over whos the wisenheimer
3362772 i think this request should be treated with the same seriousness as any of the others we consider here right now the citizens of guelph are facing a horrible situation and many of them dont even know it there looms on the horizon the clear and present danger of a massive concerto shortage and if we dont act that possibility could become very real
3362773 uh huh and this has what impact exactly on the residents of this city
3362774 well orchestral music is vital to the cultural development of any environment and i feel that it is our responsibility as agents of the government of this land to do all we can to provide enrichment whenever possible besides the director contributed to the honourable mr johnsons campaign under the table and im sleeping with the tuba player so its in our best interests to push this right on through
3362775 well when you put it that way all in favour
3362776 chelsea is a club that is a growing name before it was real madrid barcelona manchester united milan if we win one or two big competitions im sure well have fans all over the world maybe it wont be the same as madrid manchester or ac milan because our history is not the same and you dont make a history in two three or ten years maybe in 20 or 50 years chelsea will be on that level
3362777 i am not jos mourinho so why compare me with him mourinho says i will win ten championships i dont say i will win ten i say i will try i am from south brazil were different ill say we will try to win all the competitions but in my culture ill never say i will win this this or that
3362778 im more modest maybe mourinho says i win and afterwards if he does not win it causes problems because the manager doesnt play its the players and if they make a mistake you then have to say it is the players who are bad and i will never do that you are the man who must take the responsibility
3362779 since i came to chelsea we have only spent 10million about 8million for deco maybe they spend more money before but now they dont spend the same because they already have a base they need a coach to develop young players and i am that coach
3362780 ik geloof dat het een storm in een glas water is
3362781 ik blijf het vreemd vinden dat ik daarover niet ben ge nformeerd
3362782 ik wist alleen dat makaay zou worden klaargestoomd voor japan verder is het voor mij geen issue roy is zelf verantwoordelijk of ik al gerust gesteld ben ik ben pas gerust als roy weer terug is
3362783 roy heeft met verbeek gesproken en het uitgelegd verbeek reageerde kalm er is niets aan de hand roy heeft twee verschillende scans ondergaan daaruit bleek dat er geen enkel probleem was met de voet

3362787 i spent the first thirty years of my working life in the aerospace industry eighteen of those were at the space end of it including working on structures for the arianne rocket programme
3362788 as my employers became more international they became more bureaucratic and i was spending more time reporting than doing which meant long hours catching up with the work i wanted to get done
3362789 when i decided to leave my intention was to be a self employed industrial photographer but now everybody has a pocket digital camera there wasnt a market for that i looked for jobs at organisations like the environment agency and the rspb and was very glad when they took me on
3362790 my father gave me an interest in the outdoors id been an rspb member for many years but im not a bird specialist although i do find them spiritually uplifting
3362791 its not all beards and binoculars here and not everybody is involved in conservation but we do have an interest in the environment for me the most satisfying thing has been the change from a culture of reporting to a culture of doing thats what my work used to be like
3362792 load and performance testing is the killer application for cloud computing
3362793 companies can very easily create a real world test environment without having to invest in it developers have virtually unlimited and affordable access to thousands of servers memory storage etc and can essentially on demand simulate load and performance tests for tens of thousands of users without having to purchase the hardware

3363122 recent escalation in military engagement between russia and georgia poses a threat to certain key oil and gas pipelines which transit georgia
3363123 there have been no deliberate attempts to damage that pipeline
3363124 we think it any attack would be counter active even though it can happen in a conflict
3363125 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
3363126 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbours georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
3363127 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
3363128 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
3363129 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets
3363130 renewed flows through georgia expected from september could be further delayed if the line is damaged during the russia georgia conflict
3363131 along the same corridor runs the south caucasus gas pipeline a branch of this pipeline continues through to the russian port of tuapse transiting the region of abkhazia another georgian area affected by separatist action where russian troops are reportedly also being mobilised
3363132 total product exports leaving georgian ports typically average 50 000 70 000 barrels per day

3363218 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3363219 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3363220 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3363221 we had some heavy fire on the back side of the structure
3363222 we woke up to all these lights on our street and an ambulance in our front yard
3363223 then all of a sudden the flames just shot up in the sky and all the water came out
3363224 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3363225 circuit of figure 28 can activate the ne555 monostable output then a capacitively coupled audio signal surely should but realize that for your application youll want the circuit configuration of figure 3
3363226 it is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit
3363227 we have to look in the coming days how pieters will recover and if he will be able to do his coaching job
3363228 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3363229 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3363230 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3363231 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3363232 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3363233 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3363234 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry
3363235 if you are a muslim you are already a criminal suspect in the eyes of the chinese
3363236 this is chinese territory you have to obey the rules
3363237 i think steve will only start doing a bit of work later this week so he will not be fit for thursday
3363238 dominic cork has been a great ambassador for lancashire both on and off the field and is fully committed to finishing the championship season with the club
3363239 the commitment date we have made to the administration and congress has been march 2015 and that hasnt changed
3363240 without as much information as we have today we were attempting to close the gap between shuttle retirement and the first flight of orion and ares 1 to the absolute minimum and so we were trying to push the project towards a september 2013 date internally
3363241 that was not a commitment in any sense because we knew we had not built into that any contingencies everything would have to go perfect to make that date and would probably have required some additional funding
3363242 now weve changed our planning date from september 2013 date to a september 2014 date

3363250 roosh i need help this weekend im seeing a girl
3363251 with visual studio 2008 service pack 1 you can now connect directly to sql server 2008 and you can develop against that
3363252 you can take the data in your app and turn it into a rest service without having to write any plumbing
3363253 were making it significantly easier for developers to deploy their apps and to make a kind of a great application deployment experience on the desktop
3363254 it felt awesome it was really controlled over the first 100 and i gave it everything coming home
3363255 it finally feels good to get a good swim after the 100m which was so disappointing
3363256 i looked at what i did wrong and decided tried to control the stroke better

3363258 we hebben het al meer dan een keer gezegd en ik wil het nog eens bevestigen wij zijn een niet talrijk en verdeeld volk dat is een probleem
3363259 door de staking van aviapartner moest de bagage op het vliegtuig blijven
3363260 de reizigers moesten te voet van het vliegtuig naar het luchthavengebouw
3363261 we wilden geen tweede vliegtuig laten overkomen want anders stond het hier ook geblokkeerd daarom kwamen er drie personeelsleden over van de vs met een vlucht van american airlines ze haalden de bagage van het vliegtuig reinigden de toiletten en laden de bagage van de andere reizigers in
3363262 we gaan na de staking alles op een rijtje zetten en kijken of we het kunnen verhalen op iemand
3363263 in terms of maximizing impact and joining forces to control the epidemic this merger is an innovative and bold move
3363264 this is the sort of consolidation i believe we will see more of in the future across the aids sector
3363265 bringing together a substantial country presence with an increased information exchange dialogue and advocacy capacity will facilitate more coherent civil society voices and mobilisation around aids and related priorities such as tb
3363266 in terms of maximizing impact and joining forces to control the epidemic this merger is an innovative and bold move
3363267 this is the sort of consolidation i believe we will see more of in the future across the aids sector
3363268 understanding and being committed to greater impact requires ngos and other types of organisations to honestly examine how they can be most effective
3363269 the alliance and hdn see this ambition as more important than preserving established organisational identities
3363270 this shifting environment means organisations need to adopt higher standards of accountability respond to stricter reporting requirements and communicate better with critical and well informed stakeholders the planned joint organisation will strive to develop a reputation for transparency and providing reliable information about its work
3363271 cest nul d tre pauvre et cest nul davoir limpression que dune
3363272 het is een gepassioneerd verslag van haar liefde voor de overleden dichter en reflecties over haar rol als literaire weduwe
3363273 het is een nieuwe aanwinst voor een beter begrip van de relatie tussen dylan thomas en zijn vrouw
3363274 het is heel rauw en emotioneel soms schrijft ze o mijn god ik wou dat ik nooit met hem getrouwd was en op andere momenten drukt ze de wens uit dat ze hem in het graf een knuffel kon geven
3363275 o god oh dylan het moet koud zijn daarbeneden het is boven al koud genoeg in november de vuilste maand van het jaar dat je gedood heeft op de negende gemene dag kon ik maar een kom met je brood en melk en zout brengen om je op te warmen
3363276 rusland wil dat georgi zijn troepen weghaalt uit de afvallige regios zuid osseti en abchazi en belooft zelf geen geweld meer te gebruiken
3363277 het is perfect normaal dat rusland de belangen wil verdedigen van zowel de russen in rusland als van de russischtaligen buiten rusland
3363278 het is eveneens normaal dat de internationale gemeenschap de integriteit de soevereiniteit en de onafhankelijkheid van georgi wil garanderen
3363279 russia has sent troops and tanks across an international border
3363280 although turkey doesnt like the present regime it has always tried to keep iranians both at bay and collaborate with them it is an extremely delicate balancing act and it will continue to be so
3363281 the visit is all about controlled risks and the most important aspect is a gas deal with iran not the nuclear program because turkey has little influence on that
3363282 ankara definitely does not sympathize with the theodemocracy theocracy partial democracy of iran but not having a hostile attitude against iran is important for turkeys domestic stability as well as its energy needs
3363283 will the visit really help turkey i doubt it its more beneficial for ahmadinejad hell get another 15 minutes in the spotlight when he unleashes his trademark attacks against
3363284 for return path customers this acquisition solidifies return paths market leadership with a larger client base more innovative tools and services and a larger professional services team it also increases the companys base of isp and filtering receiver partners and brings the industrys two leading third party whitelists under one roof making return path the undisputed leader in third party email accreditation the deal the terms of which were not disclosed was signed on august 6 and is expected to close on august 18 while specific integration plans are still being worked through the company plans to maintain the sender score certified whitelist and the habeas safelist as separate and distinct programs
3363285 if we thought we were finished we would have lost
3363286 they never give us anything so it was fantastic to turn that on them for a change and come back from five points down in the third set
3363287 it was probably the best eight or nine points we have played against one of the best pairs in the world
3363288 it might have meant a tiny bit more being chinese in the first round in china
3363289 only leaves him the options of resigning or dissolving parliament or both
3363290 when he was asked how musharraf would avoid the impeachment vote he declined to reply
3363291 what pervaiz elahi and others said at a meeting on sunday in lahore was that the government does not have enough evidence to present in a vote
3363292 i guess im a little anxious about reaching the major leagues
3363293 its like a kid getting ready for christmas and you count down to christmas day the anticipation is building up but im enjoying myself i havent talked to anyone from the rays front office all year
3363294 im just going to keep doing what ive been doing my last start wasnt as good as i would have liked but the two before that i threw really well
3363295 in working on our pricing policy we found that it was complicated by the presence of two variables both of which affect price the first is that our industrial plant which has supplied the fuel for the carrboro pittsboro hillsborough durham raleigh and burlington pumps currently produces biodiesel from chicken fat that is purchased on a global commodities market because there is a limited supply and because there are multiple biodiesel plants vying for the same fat the price may go up or down depending on global pricing of fats and oils there is a free soybean oil price index open to the public where you can check the current pricing for soybean oil although not exact chicken fat historically has traded for about slightly less than the price of soybean oil so you can use that general rule to get a sense of what feedstocks currently cost us as the price of chicken fat increases the production cost increases and above a certain amount the price of the fuel must also be increased to prevent us from producing the fuel at a loss although the community tank trail has never been a lucrative venture we cannot sustainably keep distribution alive if it is a money losing venture to summarize the price of fuel may increase independent of petroleum pricing if the market price of biodiesel feedstocks ie chicken fat necessitates it the second variable that impacts pricing is our limited supply because we only have a very small fraction of biodiesel available compared to the local diesel fuel demand we cannot sustain pricing below the current price of diesel fuel every time we have attempted to do so our tanks have been drained immediately and those members that use biodiesel even when it is more expensive have not been able to get fuel many piedmont biofuels members use biodiesel because they believe it is a better fuel because no war is required and because it keeps our money in the local economy very few piedmont biofuels members use biodiesel to save money for these reasons we have found it necessary to always keep the price of our biodiesel over the price of petroleum diesel so that there is guaranteed supply for those members that use biodiesel for the reasons mentioned above some members have asked if it would just be possible to limit the amount of fuel that may be dispensed and unfortunately our pumps do not allow for that feature other people have suggested that we should limit memberships but we have elected to also not go down that path because we dont want to operate like a private club in summary we have decided that biodiesel will always need to be slightly over the current average price of diesel fuel in our area independent of feedstock costs because we need the buffer of that margin to keep the demand in line with our supply that said we will do our best to keep the price at a modest premium over the price of diesel fuel so long as the feedstock prices as mentioned in part one permit that local price of diesel fuel daily usually both of these variables move in tandem ie chicken feedstock prices increase as the price of of petroleum increases however in some cases this may not always be true at the biodiesel cooperative in moncure biodiesel is made exclusively from used fryer oil that is collected locally by collecting our own feedstocks directly from restaurants our cooperative has been able to keep feedstock costs lower than commodity chicken fat pricing for that reason feedstock costs have remained relatively stable at the cooperative meaning the only factor influencing fuel price at the coop is the very limited supply the cooperative has a production capacity of just 2500 gallons per month for that reason the cooperative may at times be less expensive than the rest of the community tank trail however it will never be less than the local average price of petroleum diesel fuel as listed at the fuel gauge report site mentioned above the cooperative may increase or decrease the price of our biodiesel adjusting for the current average price of diesel fuel independent of the price of the fuel at the other locations with an attempt to float just slightly higher than the average price of diesel fuel although the factors that influence our trail pricing are not simple we hope that this pricing policy will serve as a future reference to help explain pricing adjustments on the b100 tank trail
3363296 do what you can with what you have where you are
3363297 we believe strongly that the key to biofuels sustainability is keeping it small and keeping it local and using waste oils as much as possible
3363298 we hope that area restaurants will join us in the effort to provide our local region with affordable fuels made from our own local resources rather than contributing to the continued importation of foreign petroleum
3363299 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3363300 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3363301 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3363302 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3363303 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3363304 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3363305 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3363306 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3363307 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3363308 the odds of the suspects stumbling onto this were astronomical
3363309 i am looking forward to another switch on this years line up promises a great evening of entertainment for listeners and all the people joining the celebrations
3363310 there has been a great deal of interest in the switch on thanks to the early announcement the top gear team will be doing the honours this year
3363311 the illuminations are a very important asset to the resort and we are pleased to announce such an exciting line up for what will be a great start to the 2008 illuminations season
3363312 the port handled over 30 million tonnes in 2007 the fifteenth consecutive year of growth in throughput
3363313 dublin port is the port of choice for irelands importers and exporters
3363314 over 80 per cent of imports arriving at dublin port are consumer goods destined for retail outlets in the city and surrounding areas
3363315 becoming more and more acceptable and being taken advantage of by some young men in a way that conflicts with the rules and regulations of islam
3363316 using cats and dogs to make passes at women and pester families
3363317 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored mr medvedev said on national television
3363318 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3363319 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them mr medvedev told defence minister anatoly serdyukov at a televised meeting

3363324 wir haben den seit vergangenem jahr gesuchten gianfranco antonioli in aprilia festgenommen
3363325 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
3363326 wir haben hier schon viele menschen operiert vielleicht 40 oder 50
3363327 das ist kein krieg zwischen soldaten sondern ein krieg von soldaten gegen zivilisten
3363328 wenn ihr wirklich reue empfindet dann akzeptiert die strafe die ihr bekommt
3363329 wir sind sehr erleichtert dass der staatsanwalt diesen weg geht hermann war mehr wert
3363330 wie kann man einen menschen nur so aus dem leben rei en
3363331 allein f r die folterungen h tten sie die strafe verdient die der staatsanwalt gefordert hat
3363332 wir w nschen uns dass der fall noch einmal zur ck ans landgericht bonn geht und es ein neues verfahren gibt
3363333 hermann war ein liebevoller herzlicher und sch chternen mensch aber er kam mit dem leben allein nicht zurecht
3363334 er f hlte sich unwohl und wollte schnell wieder raus
3363335 er sagte man m sse sich vor den inhaftierten russen in acht nehmen die seien gnadenlos
3363336 hermann ist damit f r uns ein zweites mal gestorben
3363337 er war ein kleinkrimineller aber weder gewaltt tig noch rabiat
3363338 ich wei dass hermann mit abstand der schw chste in der konstellation war
3363339 hermann war mehr wert als 15 jahre knast die bei guter f hrung wom glich ohnehin zu einer vorzeitigen freilassung f hren
3363340 hermann ist damit f r uns ein zweites mal gestorben
3363341 sie war mit jemandem zusammen der sie nicht gut behandelt hat
3363342 dass computers chtige in handschellen in die klinik gebracht werden
3363343 wenn es an den finanzm rkten zu klaren exzessen kommt reichen selbstverpflichtungen der marktteilnehmer nicht aus
3363344 das finanzsystem ist in den vergangenen zw lf monaten durch einen stresstest gelaufen den wir in dieser form nicht erwartet haben
3363345 die turbulenzen dauern l nger an und betreffen inzwischen mehr segmente des finanzmarktes als wir vorher angenommen hatten
3363346 he told us he was not advised of his right to counsel when he was invited for questioning they told him he was just a witness so theres a really a cause for investigation of the legality of his arrest and detention
3363347 we asked them why there was no warrant of arrest they said its part of a hot pursuit were going to check that out if that is a correct definition of hot pursuit if it would warrant a warrantless arrest
3363348 weve received many complaints about that first they arrest suspects under a warrantless arrest and then interrogate interview inquest and file charges against them once a case is filed the person could no longer be released
3363349 its a live kidnapping case they requested that we withhold the name of the victim and detainee because the victim hasnt surfaced yet and it might jeopardize the operation
3363350 but on the issue and illegality of the arrest and detention we can come up with our finding after today
3363351 after the interview we will determine the culpability of the officers
3363352 you can also prime her by squirting a little fluid in the bathroom sink before she goes in to use it
3363353 talk about a beach vacation you took using sensual terms
3363354 i went to virginia beach and there were so many hot chicks i just had a huge boner the whole time wait where are you going
3363355 ill be the number two guy here in scranton in six weeks how name repetition personality mirroring and never breaking off a handshake im always thinking one step ahead like a carpenter that makes stairs

3363357 the most recent quarter has been a transitional one for our business we are encouraged by the results of the growth initiatives that weve been working towards such as the continued roll out of our alot toolbar and homepage brand and the continued growth of destination sites like spill com in addition our new miva media technology platform remains on schedule for a us release in the fourth quarter of this year
3363358 with these sp1 releases were doing something a little different
3363359 were providing the typical guidance but were also looking at customer feedback and the way people are building applications and were putting in building blocks to help them do that better were giving them a more model driven approach to development
3363360 another big area of focus is were making data driven applications better and easier to build and to be flexible and able to evolve over time
3363361 were enabling developers to be able to build application ui user interface and customize that in a model driven way
3363362 were making the challenge of application development a much easier and quicker proposition
3363363 visual studio 2008 sp1 is more than a service pack it is the ship vehicle for the entity framework as well as astoria aka ado net data services as well as dynamic data
3363364 so it is full of new features on top of any service pack items we may care about
3363365 its rare thing to have the right business opportunity at the right time with the right people
3363366 its even more rare to have the right technology at the same time such was our experience with freenatal ado net data services and ado net entity framework were precisely what the team needed to deliver a secure robust back end for this product its not often the planets align like that
3363367 at first we werent so optimistic we were rather skeptical in fact
3363368 we knew that freenatal would be a rich ajax based web application we also knew that wed store the data in sql server the question was how to connect the two what to put in the middle entity framework seemed like a no brainer but we were wary about the new technology on the block ado net data services imagine how pleased we were to have a technology completely measure up to our needs and expectations
3363369 after many years of manually architecting my own data access layers i can honestly say that entity framework was able to accomplish everything of the systems that i have built and much more in projects of the past i have spent many weeks both maintaining and updating data access layers and it is great to see that microsoft has build a data access layer that handles all of the setup and maintenance for you i have been very impressed by the ease with which queries and updates can be performed using linq to entities and the flexibility of the underlying model freenatal as well as other new projects i have worked on have benefited greatly from the time savings of using entity framework as well as the maintainability microsoft has truly taken out a major piece of any new project the data access layer and done all of the work for you
3363370 on the freenatal project we were able to quickly add new features using javascript and html with rarely needing to change the underlying ado net data service that handled all of the data access
3363371 while ado net data services comes with most of what you need right out of the box it is also very customizable with the ability to add focused queries and updates using service operations
3363372 we have used query and change interceptors extensively on freenatal throughout the application we were able to write simple url queries and allow data services to automatically filter the data retrieved by each user that should have access to it we were able to use change interceptors to update interrelated fields such as an estimated date of delivery and the gestational age of a fetus which allowed us a simple abstraction of updating a single field and having the results cascade through the database
3363373 using the entity framework has significantly sped up our development cycle by removing a lot of the custom code we have to write
3363374 the entity framework took away the tedium of having to write standard data access code and business objects which gave our team a big productivity boost
3363375 trotz der behauptung des russischen pr sidenten dass der milit reinsatz gegen georgien gestoppt wurde bombardieren russische kampfjets in diesem augenblick zwei georgische ortschaften au erhalb s dossetiens
3363376 der sicherheitsrat fordert die sofortige und bedingungslose einstellung der feindseligkeiten und den vollst ndigen r ckzug russischer und georgischer kr fte auf ihre positionen vor dem 7 august
3363377 ernsthafte fragen ber russlands absichten in georgien und in der region auf
3363378 diese aktionen besch digen gravierend die stellung russlands in der welt
3363379 russland hat mit der invasion eines souver nen nachbarstaates begonnen und bedroht eine demokratische regierung die vom volk gew hlt wurde
3363380 souver nit t unabh ngigkeit und territorialen integrit t georgiens in seinen international anerkannten grenzen

3363383 i happen to disagree with them in regards to our film
3363384 it s a shame that they are out there and i hope that when it comes out they will actually see the jokes for what they are
3363385 everyone has the right to protest it s a free country anytime that anyone feels that they are justified in their heart more power to them
3363386 the task of leadership is to create an alignment of strengths in ways that make weaknesses irrelevant
3363387 we were very impressed with the inventory and purchasing functionality and by eliminating duplicate
3363388 the integration of unit of marketing value example an offer or brand name into an existing integration point example inside a transaction stream such as when a cashier makes a suggestion for an up or cross sell
3363389 is more peaceful because there isnt as much planetary migration and not quite as many planets forming
3363390 the fact that we dont fully understand gravity from a physics standpoint makes this modeling useless
3363391 cassini could also help us understand what is generating this heat inside of the moon
3363392 were looking for any type of signature of life theres been no evidence of that so far
3363393 its like trying to take snapshots of a fencepost on the side of a highway from your car
3363394 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3363395 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3363396 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3363397 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3363398 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3363399 were going to stop buying silly things like that as opposed to giving up going out for a drink
3363400 cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than many consumer products
3363401 while not immune from the consequences of an economic slowdown we can certainly look to the future with more confidence than most
3363402 the odd bar of chocolate is not going to break the bank
3363403 i always have a piece a day and i cant see that changing
3363404 mortgage lending activity remains relatively weak and will decline further in the coming months as a result of funding constraints and lower consumer demand
3363405 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3363406 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3363407 we are certainly seeing an impact from people opting to stay in and customers are choosing us as they dont even need to waste money on petrol by going to a traditional video store
3363408 many consumers are trading down which in our industry means that they are eating out less often and staying at home
3363409 when you take into account travel food drink and entertainment the cost of a saturday night out can soon add up
3363410 we should be using that money to invest in renewable resources
3363411 vi como 30 000 georgianos daban su vida en la segunda guerra mundial
3363412 no quiero que esto vuelva a suceder rusia escupe sobre todo lo que quiere y yo he venido aqu para dar apoyo a nuestro gobierno contras las acciones de rusia
3363413 cuenta con el apoyo de europa de estados unidos de todos los pa ses democr ticos del mundo y eso
3363414 primero ten amos mucho miedo miedo a las bombas a las armas a las sangre pens bamos que rusia invadir a todo el pa s que tomar a tiflis esta ma ana y parece que finalmente ha llegado la calma estamos contentos y a la vez nos sentimos orgullosos de nuestro pa s
3363415 prefiero que rusia se quede con osetia del sur antes de que vuelva la violencia ha muerto demasiada gente y la situaci n debe calmarse cre amos que rusia invadir a todo el pa s as que a partir de ahora todo lo que pase ser bueno

3363454 when the tyrant has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader
3363455 i think it was unchivalrous of him to basically say that he wasnt in love with her
3363456 i saw them hunter and her friends as a tribe that i wanted to study

3363468 if you lose weight after diagnosis you can achieve some long term benefits in terms of blood pressure and glycemic control that extend even beyond the point at which you regain weight
3363469 we havent had results like this before this is telling us that with a significant mean weight loss of 10 7 kilograms 23 5 pounds in 18 months theres an improvement despite weight regain after 36 months
3363470 its entirely possible that one of the explanations here is that if we looked at 15 years we wouldnt find that benefit continuing

3363476 from this newest article the comfortable zone looks like a length of time longer than the other studies seven years which is a nice amount of time thats enough time for any type of peptic ulcer disease to improve
3363477 some people think if i take ppis i can eat garbage all day long
3363478 we need to tighten up on those patients these medications are not without any kind of risk
3363479 thats not the way the world really works any more

3363491 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3363492 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3363493 a number of girls were on the short list for the show and lin was the best actress while yang had the best voice
3363494 so at the end of the day they decided to have both
3363495 however because of the poor visibility of the night some previously recorded foots may have been used
3363496 i do not think the chinese state realises how unethical this is they dont understand what kind of values they are reflecting

3363545 i found being an olympian was not about the title it was more about the heart its about the spirit that you had put into the journey and its about the struggle

3363629 as one audience member put it in a question to university of chicago economist allen sanderson dont you agree that throwing a party can be an impetus to clean up the house
3363630 i dont think anyone ever had a party on a saturday night because they wanted to clean up the house replied sanderson who argued that while the olympics might leave behind a legacy of improvements it would be more prudent to simply spend the money on those projects now for example if chicagos bid is successful as all panelists seem to agree was highly likely an empty truck parking lot near mccormick place will become the olympic village and then after 2016 a new public housing complex but if we want the housing complex why not just build it now sanderson argued that the question we should be asking is we have a plan how do the olympics fit in rather than how can we benefit from hosting the olympics furthermore he rejected the pro olympic argument that much of the financial backing for the games would be provided by contributions from the private sector after all each philanthropist who donates money to make the olympics happen isnt donating that money to another worthy cause such as a charity

3363667 many americans polls showed were uneasy about invading a country with no clear connection to the sept 11 attacks pentagon and white house officials believed the military analysts could play a crucial role in helping overcome this resistance
3363668 in the fall and winter leading up to the invasion
3363669 the pentagon armed its analysts with talking points portraying iraq as an urgent threat
3363670 we were able to click on every single station and every one of our folks were up there delivering our message
3363671 the analysts went on tv and radio decrying amnesty international criticizing calls to close the facility and asserting that all detainees were treated humanely

3363675 this particular one was chosen to demonstrate our might of going below sea level to sabotage oil facilities
3363676 this is one of our plans to cripple the economic base of rivers state
3363677 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3363678 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3363679 we have warned al qureyshi many times but he did not take heed
3363680 we had to wait till school started so our 9 year old could meet new friends and we had to drive to neighboring communities for play dates
3363681 there was a period of time when the weeds were taller than our kids
3363682 there were six months where we were holding our breath the original builder was clearly in a desperate situation
3363683 the talk of the neighborhood was how concerned we were about preserving our investment
3363684 theyre still ghost towns lot after lot after lot hadnt sold
3363685 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3363686 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3363687 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3363688 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3363689 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3363690 we are trying to be more efficient which means not do consultations that result in a difference for the species
3363691 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3363692 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3363693 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3363694 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3363695 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3363696 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3363697 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3363698 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3363699 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3363700 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3363701 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3363702 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3363703 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3363704 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

3363707 this was a deeper operation in a place they thought they believed that we would not be able to get to
3363708 i will not announce a success before the ink is dry but the information we are getting makes the acceptance of my governments demands by the u s more probable than only a few weeks ago
3363709 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3363710 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties

3363715 i believed i was a young untouchable great singer who could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted
3363716 i had an image of myself and when things change or life moves on thats when people struggle
3363717 for me that happened at quite a young age i had to make major decisions in my life that upset the image i had of myself i had to accept i had to lose the image of myself
3363718 just little things like that change your perspective of who you are
3363719 touring america changed me a lot i became greedy it was all about wants and needs and thats not me as a human being
3363720 thats not the kind of person i am and i didnt like the person id become
3363721 i was putting myself under a lot of pressure and allowing past failures and things like that to control the moment instead of just expressing myself like i used to be able to
3363722 id lost that especially as a performer i was half the singer i used to be
3363723 do you know that fella gollum from lord of the rings it was a really mild version of that
3363724 i kept thinking hang on a sec ive should have a good life here why am i feeling this way
3363725 im in what i believe to be one of the best bands in the country and im sat panicking about random stuff distorted thoughts
3363726 suicide became an option i became a very unhappy young man but even suicide is the act of an ego thats the final act of an ego to protect oneself from being wrong
3363727 when your bodys physically shaking and you cant keep still and youre sweating and youre sat watching your tv and your hearts like a machine gun thats when i got to the point where i was thinking theres something not right here
3363728 which is what i needed to hear so i checked in and got myself sorted for a few weeks
3363729 after that its just been constant care and attention ive been sober for two and a half years now
3363730 staying fit eating well seeing a regular therapist whenever i can whenever ive got things to talk about
3363731 stay present as opposed to living in the past or the future
3363732 you just need to look down the song titles to know that
3363733 strength in numbers the spike refers to addiction wants and needs and the grey areas in between
3363734 ive tried illegal drugs and legal drugs and theyre both shit all it does is stops us from discovering who we are i dont know why people are so afraid of reality
3363735 so there was a mild fascination with addiction and what drives people songs called the left side and get through it are obvious ones

3363738 im pleased with my time even though a couple of technical things went wrong
3363739 going for air and getting a mouthful of water instead that puts a damper on doing well it was the second breath out of the turn its happened to me before you just learn not to panic that a breath is coming in two more strokes
3363740 its only going to get a whole lot faster later on in the finals
3363741 its going to take what the world record is now to get on the podium
3363742 we see more rats but that doesnt mean there are more rats
3363743 is a combination of factors but theres not a lot of evidence these days of direct disease coming from contact with urban rats in the population
3363744 you should throw rat contaminated food away because they can carry salmonella
3363745 their outlook is looking much less healthy than they were a year ago even six months ago
3363746 i would suggest that the real problem with technology is not in the first six months of this year maybe it is not going to come in even the second half of this year but i really do believe that 2009 could be the year when all of this finally catches up with the technology sector
3363747 there are going to be some areas which are going to grow dramatically some areas unfortunately that i believe are going to see fairly major declines but i think that the average for the first time is going to see a very minor but still a negative for 2009
3363748 in financial services a substantial amount of business is outsourced and by virtue of its size it will naturally be a target for review what one would presume will happen is that people will re open negotiations with their supplier looking for short term cost savings
3363749 any business process outsourcer that can say to a company we can save you money and not only that but we can save you money this financial year those companies are doing very well
3363750 its a very nicely produced ad with great visuals and has a real professional look and feel the opening of the ad begins with the planet earth and zooms down to a front porch in maine its a nice touch
3363751 in maine we have a law that if doctors teachers or commercial film developers observe any form of child abuse or pornography they have to report that to law enforcement if we require all these other professionals to report something that is absolutely against the law the people who possibly come across this more than others should have to report it
3363752 in general there have been a number of changes to the business interruption risks faced by firms because of changes to the supply chain and the way most firms now structure their business
3363753 in the past it was very much a case of damage to or loss of your physical assets but many industries have now outsourced much of their processes and the life science and pharmaceutical industries are no exception this has resulted in a lengthening of the supply chain and the risks associated with it
3363754 with the increased use of technology this can range from issues with computer aided design and production to the ability to retain confidential information within the business when dealing with third party providers
3363755 there is also the issue of protecting your intellectual property and the goodwill in the business and for the pharmaceutical industry you have a range of particular threats that would not be covered under a physical damage product
3363756 the idea was to create a blueprint of a product that will enable the policyholder to provide the protection for the non physical risks of their supply chain
3363757 we undertook research with the managers of the life science and pharmaceutical firms to ask which were the risks that were keeping them up at night and aimed to create the product which would provide a solution to those products
3363758 it has enabled us to accurately build the product for the company and gives them the level of cover they require
3363759 this is a market leading product and one which was first into the sector and the response has been such that we believe it is an area that other underwriters are now looking at
3363760 they have similar risks in terms of supply chain and the threat of product recall and we are looking at how we can provide the same peace of mind in that industry
3363761 yes we had a great time and the girls loved the pool and they enjoyed the visits to carcassonne peyrpetuse etc that we did and even managed to get the courage to use a little bit of french in the shops and markets
3363762 we are still benefiting from the total relaxation of our two weeks in the villa the area is really something special and lavalette is an ideal base all six of us really enjoyed our two weeks many thanks for the welcome pack especially the wine amp sparkling wine both of which we really enjoyed the villa is very well equipped and it was great to have the few extras in the cupboard
3363763 whats worse is that she had to buy her own prom dress last year
3363764 there were times when we had so little money that we actually had to make a choice between groceries or medication for my wife maylo who has lupus
3363765 it wasnt much money but its what i had to do to feed my family

3363777 theres something about our society we dont value or respect the people who are harvesting our food
3363778 its not just that theyre sleeping on uncomfortable beds these are people sleeping on cardboard mats under overpasses for three months at a go and thats so we can buy our grapes for 98 cents a pound what are those grapes worth if that person has had to do that i cant see that it doesnt add up for me
3363779 as ive gotten into more hobby farming lately ive found growing plants to be kind of a magical thing its such an incredible experience to cut open a cantaloupe and take the seeds from that cantaloupe and create a hundred cantaloupe plants from it
3363780 and then to think that there are people doing that work on a daily basis six seven days a week and to think that we have no respect for the sacredness of that skill and of that job
3363781 these are people we dont even want to pay a minimum wage to
3363782 we dont want to let them across our borders we dont want to give them any of the care or respect which other people in our country get for i think lesser jobs
3363783 i have to be honest after we mounted the show the first time in 2002 my plan was that i was going to go to thailand for a short break to recharge and come back and start on what would be the next project but i realized then and i realize virtually every day since then that this is a project that will be with me for life it is with me for good
3363784 i hope that if this work inspires anything it inspires people to ask what is my personal responsibility as a recipient of this labor or this food which literally keeps me alive in making sure that these people who do this work are treated fairly i feel its a really valid question and if were not asking it its very very sad
3363785 there needs to be a level a basic foundation of compassion
3363786 no matter where you fall on the dietary spectrum whether its caviar or its soybeans there is some way in which the harvesting growing and preparations of those foods impact several chains in the social strata
3363787 reduce the mandatory independent reviews government scientists have been performing for 35 years according to a draft first obtained by the associated press
3363788 would bar federal agencies from assessing the emissions from projects that contribute to global warming and its effect on species and habitats the revisions also would limit which effects can be considered harmful and set a 60 day deadline for wildlife experts to evaluate a project when they are asked to become involved if no decision is made within 60 days the project can move ahead
3363789 what has been extremely successful for us is partnering with not only other online companies
3363790 but also brands that are off line to reach that audience
3363791 for you to stand out it takes seven to nine times for them to see you and then it has to be something that really speaks to them
3363792 to create a website that resonates and attracts repeat traffic
3363793 you really have to have a connection with your audience
3363794 we are working to help to mitigate potential increases and to educate customers
3363795 we expect that more competitors will come into this state after rate caps are lifted
3363796 he would support a cap extension in the absence of the agenda items hes put forth
3363797 we would expect there to be some jump in prices just because theyve been kept for so long
3363798 you really have to have that increase in order to move toward a competitive marketplace
3363799 state local tax burdens dip as income growth outpaces tax growth
3363800 the tax collections havent grown as fast as income has
3363801 this ranking really does not paint a complete picture of the tax burden on the state
3363802 from a competitiveness standpoint the corporate tax is out of whack
3363803 respect for human dignity instead of indoctrinating students with fanaticism and bigotry
3363804 this is the hardest decision i have ever had to make i was so looking forward to playing in the olympics
3363805 i have never had so many treatments in my life
3363806 i have had magnetic therapy massage creams everything but nothing is helping the latest view is that i will have to completely immobilise it with a splint only time can heal this injury
3363807 i couldnt wait to get back into it so i started practising with this guy and we were having really good practice and hitting the ball really hard but i think i was too enthusiastic and gradually the thumb got more and more sore i thought i could get over it in time but there just wasnt enough time
3363808 its too soon to make a call on that i will wait a while first
3363809 its a bit of a setback but these guys were having to double up and play doubles and singles on the same day at wimbledon it is not as if kevin has not done it before
3363810 this is not a highway vehicle its legal on any road from 55 mile an hour and down
3363811 although i dont think youll see me on route 30 with it it only goes 40 and i think to be safe you want to stay on roads that are 40 mile an hour
3363812 the family had a brilliant time they talked to david jason and seemed to be the main focus of the day
3363813 the ambulance airlifted kieran to hospital on the day of the accident and it is believed this is what saved his life
3363814 it seems like a long walk from that room to the podium mondale recalled in an interview with minnpost
3363815 in the back of your mind you know you are speaking to thousands of people in the auditorium and that there will be millions watching all over the world if you screw it up you know youre going to live with it for the rest of your life
3363816 it got better as the speech went along but the words were totally washed out as you started your speech mondale recalled
3363817 it turns out that situation may have helped produce one of the most famous political flubs of modern times
3363818 made the reference to huuuu bert horaaaatio hornblower umm humphrey
3363819 if anything went wrong freeman was supposed to rub his shoe across the back of his leg and the people behind him would get the machine running again said mondale
3363820 the machine stopped working orville was rubbing his foot on his leg but nobody was looking he had to wing it
3363821 i guess you could say i was anxious he said
3363822 youre a little relaxed because the nomination fight is over he said
3363823 you either grow or shrink as the campaign goes on i felt i had grown
3363824 a couple of days before the speech i decided i didnt like it mondale recalled
3363825 we tightened it it needed to be exactly what i wanted to say and it had to be tight
3363826 i wanted him because i knew hed do a good job said mondale
3363827 i knew he could make the case for the america i believed in
3363828 the tone of the convention was just right he said
3363829 there was genuine excitement because of geraldine ferraro the first and to date only woman ever selected to run as a vice president we had gone into the convention trailing reagan but each night we were picking up 5 or 6 points
3363830 you know this is the one time youll have to state your case to the world there is no question and answer period theres no debate this is your chance
3363831 you dont eat anything for several hours before a speech like that mondale said
3363832 you dont want to be going errrp in the middle of your speech
3363833 it felt good to look out over the crowd recalled mondale
3363834 i was proud of how wed changed the party when i was a young man it was all white males even at the democratic convention the women would hold some kind of a tea or something and that was it wed changed that it was an impressive sight
3363835 dont rush it start slowly try to get the voice you want look around at the audience get a rhythm his speech
3363836 my fellow democrats my fellow americans i accept your nomination behind us now is the most wide open race in political history
3363837 i do not envy the drowsy harmony of the republican party he said to cheers
3363838 they squelch debate we welcome it they deny differences we bridge them they are uniform we are united they are a portrait of privilege we are a mirror of america
3363839 when we speak of family the voice is mario cuomos
3363840 my vice president will be geraldine ferraro mondale said at one point
3363841 tonight we open a new door to the future mr reagan calls it tokenism we call it america
3363842 i bet i lost a couple of pounds he said
3363843 hubert said he lost 16 pounds during the 1948 convention where he delivered his famous civil rights speeches
3363844 we knew going in it was going to be very very difficult mondale said
3363845 the election was over before it started in the minds of most people we had to use that speech that convention to at least make people think again
3363846 my dream when i was a kid was to someday be elected a county commissioner
3363847 our process for writing the menu each week starts with calling all our local providers and produce farmers and saying what do you have whats available
3363848 the students came to us about four years ago and said we want to start a small farm but we dont have anywhere to sell our stuff
3363849 my general manager and i stared at each other and then said well buy everything you grow
3363850 abrahamson also works individually with students who have food allergies or other diet restrictions and in some cases the kitchen prepares each of those students meals individually
3363851 its 50 percent the food and 50 percent the relationship
3363852 the logs are still floating on the water and are a major navigational hazard some of the logs that have detached from the ship weigh in at 50 tonnes and are 2m in length
3363853 four ships are been prepared for a recovery process of the logs this process might take about five days
3363854 navigational warnings are been transmitted on a regular basis via voice mari band radio to warn ships that are in the vicinity to keep away
3363855 i can guarantee you that if 72 percent of white boys in any school of america were failing you wouldnt need a blueprint for action
3363856 those teachers and that principal and that school district would freak out the valuation of our young people is still greatly influenced by the color of that thin wrapping that we call the skin
3363857 i realize that people are willing to see young people die fail have children too early and america can still be a great country
3363858 we see more teens coming back for theft and robbery
3363859 what makes teens continue to do more violence is when they have a lot of family problems
3363860 im predicting right now we might have a 30 percent decrease across the board in juvenile crime this year thats huge
3363861 we believe its the blueprint for action its interventions its not jail
3363862 thats what these young brothers need to hear need to see
3363863 we are looking at research that has been done on young people that have committed offenses to see what works best to getting them back to law abiding behaviors

3363866 wherever we find them we will arrest them and bring them to justice
3363867 those regimes that enslave their people have always raised the banner of democracy in their fight against islam while people see that most of them assumed power through military coups
3363868 fnb wishes to stress that the home loan applications being reassessed are those that take up to a year or longer to register are of a development type nature excluding building bonds and are not those that normally take three to four months to transfer and register
3363869 the intention of this decision is to prevent customers from taking on more debt than they are unable to service resulting in an over indebtedness position
3363870 fnb through this action wishes to prevent customers from possibly damaging their credit standing and or losing their homes as a result of over indebtedness possibly leading to insolvency
3363871 each of these home loans will be reassessed on a one on one basis with the intention of granting final approval for as many of the affected customers as possible the bank will only decline applicants in cases where the client will be severely over indebted should the transaction go ahead
3363872 customers that do not provide their updated financial information are required to confirm their intention to conclude the pending deal failing which fnb home loans will contact each and every one of the identified customers with the intention to proceed with the home loan unless the above mentioned are applied

3363874 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is

3363879 go banking could have provided cheaper banking for many consumers so this really is a missed opportunity for people particularly as we often complain that our bank charges are too high

3363885 there are a number of potential reasons why proton pump inhibitors might have this effect but we need to do further research to answer those questions
3363886 someone might have very mild heartburn that could easily be managed with other medications such as tums or zantac who are prescribed a proton pump inhibitor
3363887 and then it works but no one ever thinks of stepping down the therapy
3363888 and there are a lot of people we know who arent on these medications
3363889 however there are also people who get prescribed these medications and dont know why there is obviously appropriate use but there is inappropriate overuse and inappropriate underuse
3363890 im comfortable at this point with saying if youre only going to be on this medication a short time dont worry if youre going to be on it a long time the jurys still out as to what you should do
3363891 if youre on one of these medications and think you may be at risk for osteoporosis or you have osteoporosis or youve had a fracture in the past its a good time for you to make an appointment with your doctor to discuss why youre on these medications
3363892 i think the message is that first of all we need a different approach to try to confirm this
3363893 why have the scorpions not investigated chemical warfare expert wouter basson and the cia who have created this aids the scorpions are working for mi5 and the cia and not for south africa
3363894 integration would streamline and strengthen capacity in the fight against crime
3363895 disbanding it requires a political decision the scorpions chose some prime cases because they were serving the interests of their own political masters

3363897 all these different programs are designed to be open and solicit feedback and also be useful to projects beyond the mozilla project
3363898 we did look at exploitability at the very beginning and we decided that was a factor that is hard to capture and not all that useful
3363899 we dont have a lot of evidence that firefox users are being exploited
3363900 what in the wide wide world of sport is a goin on here
3363901 the alliance has managed to analyse 60 million downloads and streams of music on licensed websites such as youtube itunes and bebo in order to pay royalties accurately to its 60 000 members andrew shaw managing director of broadcast and online at the alliance said the trend for posting self made videos is driving the number of performances on the websites we license hairbrush divas are not only helping to generate royalties for the writers of their favourite music but could also prove to have the x factor themselves and be our stars of tomorrow
3363902 we have developed a method of distribution which pays royalties to a broad spectrum of members as effectively as possible
3363903 based on anecdotal accounts in our discussions with online brokerages both the number of attacks and dollar volume of losses has grown over the past two years
3363904 the reason for that is that most of the controls are retrospective theyre designed to go in after the attack and find the perpetrators
3363905 those old investigative methods dont work anymore its almost impossible to track down the bad guys or hold anyone accountable so it doesnt defer anything
3363906 our software analyzes your trade in milliseconds so the brokerage can let the trader know immediately if theres a potential risk or scam going on
3363907 obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers
3363908 at this time i also acquired my first car and had a few computers that dual booted between linux
3363909 the initial thrill of the thought that i could be breaking some random law drew me to wardriving to mapping the neighborhood and just overall experiencing the internet in a method unlike i had ever experienced with dial up
3363910 the act of driving around with a computer pda or gps and logging wi fi networks that are open secured or protected comes from the movie
3363911 with more and more open networks its becoming less popular
3363912 theres less need to log where the open networks are when there are so many open networks now no matter where you go the geeks who are doing the wardriving are losing interest because there are just so many open networks
3363913 one of the reasons is the sheer cost of it
3363914 people who wardrive generally try to get the most advanced receivers that they can this is a costly expenditure and it doesnt exactly improve their chance at wardriving its not fiscally feasible to wardrive
3363915 when youre not actually close to the network the performance exponentially drops so if someone is cruising in their car trying to wardrive theyre not going to get a very good signal
3363916 i suspect that potentially on the hobbyist side it has died off a bit but there are still criminals out there who see if they can get into corporate networks and those guys are going to be doing it very quietly and not publishing any of their findings
3363917 so of course it will seem theres no more interest in wardriving but those guys are still out there looking to access corporate networks
3363918 there are a lot of negative connotations there because people mistake wardrivers with hackers which they are not
3363919 a wardriver would never access the network wardrivers can detect networks without ever accessing them all you need to do is pick up that signal and thats enough for all the information a wardriver wants
3363920 but when they do thats no longer part of wardriving
3363921 wardriving in its essence has nothing to do with accessing unsecured wi fi networks its pure and simple an activity that will detect and map wi fi networks secured or unsecured this can be done on foot driving or even cycling
3363922 there has been much discussion of evil twins the sites that are designed to look like a known branded hotspots but are actually fake sites or traps designed for the innocent to log on and give up personal financial information
3363923 for the uninformed wardrivers they may happen upon an unsecured free wireless connection that has been set up specifically for their uninformed naive selves in the form of an evil twin that will intercept all the data they transmit for purposes of committing fraud
3363924 wardrivers inadvertently raise awareness that access points need to be secured for the protection of the home or business and for the end user as well
3363925 the security angle certainly gives at amp t and starbucks a leg up over the mom and pop shop that has little if any security for their access point
3363926 subscribers were plugging in these new modems without securing their networks
3363927 as a result a significant populace began hacking into these networks wardrivers were documenting the unsecured networks and putting the information available online it forced this isp to change their policy and make sure all of the routers were secure before sending them to the customers
3363928 i would actually say that in the u s it seems to have dropped a bit but in europe the number is actually growing every year
3363929 most of these databases include the bssid as well as the ssid and the geographic location
3363930 since the bssid is unique or at least should be this makes these databases usable for geo location as well the google maps application has shown that this can be made to work pretty well in areas where there are plenty of access points to get a fix from
3363931 theyre using better equipment such as gps units and capturing more data about the access point i think most wardrivers do it because it is there as the mountain climbers say or because they can it is challenging to a degree it is exploration and discovery it is all about the hunt
3363932 the hobbyists wardrivers who do this for fun it struck us that we could use this for determining location that you could get incredible value out of something you didnt build
3363933 wardrivers drive around to see who can pick up more signals and then they upload them and have contests to see who has the most
3363934 we got into that to see what theyd found and thats what got us thinking about what new models could emerge from this phenomenon the signals have grown exponentially weve mapped 31 million access points
3363935 we send out hundreds of people in trucks with devices scanning for signals and mapping the locations
3363936 they drive every single street think about la and how large that area driven every single street it takes hundreds of people we have 300 people now doing it across the world
3363937 we learned a ton about the growth of wi fi by doing that for a while but i dont proclaim to understand the wardriver thing we tried working with that community a lot early on but its hard to work with them because its hard to know what motivates them they dont do it for money they like to be on the hacker fringe doing the different thing its a very active group all over the world they communicate regularly on web sites theyre nice people

3363993 declaring the du north campus as tobacco free is one of my biggest achievements last month we invited the health minister to our campus and he was very impressed with the whole scenario and supported our campaign whole heartedly
3363994 many students after being fined for smoking in the campus used to come to me and say that this is a habit that they simply cannot give up because they are addicted to smoking that was a clear signal that a rehabilitation centre was what they needed and not just campaigns
3363995 my tenure comes to an end in a few days as re elections will be held on sep 5 however whether we stay in power or not care will be taken that privacy of the students who come to the rehab centre will be given top priority the centre will be both media and parents attention proof
3363996 at the college many students take to smoking as a style statement they are dependent on the idea of looking cool for which they smoke not because they are addicted to smoking itself
3363997 although not many student smokers are addicted to smoking they just might be so in future if not helped and since most of them would not like to reveal these things to their parents the assurance that his or her privacy will be maintained is a good thing it is a good step

3364032 i think my show is different because a lot of the teenage dramas that have been on or are on now all deal with drugs and alcohol and teenagers adding negative things to the world we focus on the positive things on teenagers because the public have a negative outlook on teens

3364037 i think that a couple episodes strayed a little bit too far away from where i think our sort of sweet spot is
3364038 so we made a concerted effort i think this season to bring us back to the lighter side of eureka and especially restoring some of the relationships that we were missing a little bit in season two

3364044 no one wants the lights to shut off in florida and because they get their coal from the mississippi river its very important for us to bring the coal ships in so they can load the coal and get it down to florida to keep the lights on
3364045 its a balancing act but we get it done we make the best decision based on the needs of each facility it has been working out well and were making it happen
3364046 ill wait 6 months and see if the screen door is still open and wait 2 additional months for tei an
3364047 as this personal and business relationship has come to an end i am hereby requesting all previous fees which were deferred until such time that you were financially able to fulfill our verbal agreement
3364048 i worked for free because she told me she had no money
3364049 i know we have lots of irish viewers at home in ireland so we are showing you this
3364050 for every games we prepare for a number of situations that may or may not unfold most of those situations dont arise for these games one of the contingencies we prepared for was substandard air
3364051 i think the benefit is as much psychological as physiological theres been so much focus on air quality
3364052 for members of our delegation to know we do have contingencies in place provides peace of mind its one less thing they need to think about
3364053 is considered the ultimate of challenges for young people when it comes to competing
3364054 i still do wear the mask when i feel its necessary obviously today and yesterday given we had rain its been nice but i still wear it when i need it
3364055 of course well support both of them as long as china gets the gold
3364056 it would be best of one of them won the snatch and the other the clean and jerk
3364057 to me its an awesome adventure and im going to learn so much and meet new people and see sports at the highest level
3364058 they took us on a long weekend trip to the great wall summer palace and brought us to eat peking duck it was a weekend straight of just going to all places
3364059 thats what the chinese always do so well against us they fight when theyre down and come back they never give you anything so it was fantastic to turn that on them for a change
3364060 it might have meant a tiny bit more being chinese opponents in the first round in china
3364061 and the fact she beat us in the olympic final four years ago might have given us a little bit of more incentive but hey it is the olympic games
3364062 if we go out and happen to win tomorrow its going to be like usa basketball vs china that type of deal
3364063 how about north and south under the federal republic of cyprus
3364064 what kurdistan that area is turkish kurds are terrorists for wanting the freedom of their lands
3364065 im reviewing everything to determine what it is thats blocking us
3364066 perhaps after these games it will be clear they will be the only outliers and have to allow women to compete
3364067 id be surprised and disappointed if we took such draconian action
3364068 all that would do is have the athletes of that country suffer
3364069 i dont think that can be considered parallel to the effort to bring women into absolutely equal gender balance
3364070 the entire gulf region and the whole arab world everyone man and woman should simply work hard at their sport there are no limits at all
3364071 i want the other women to watch me and see me and follow me
3364072 and now i want to be honest about it because i think theres still so much shame when you have mixed feelings about being a mom instead of feeling this sort of bliss i think a lot of people still really struggle with that but its hard to find other people who are willing to talk about it
3364073 am i going to look back and say god i wish i could have gone to that concert id rather be listening to my son sing songs id rather be watching him sleep
3364074 you want to integrate as much as you can russia into the international order
3364075 the declining interest is partly from the perception that scientists dont get rich like lawyers and dentists and stockbrokers
3364076 you forgot the most important thing overhauling the patent system
3364077 but also because science isnt valued in a country full of creationists
3364078 one use your immense buying power to improve the security of commercial products and services one property of technological products is that most of the cost is in the development of the product rather than the production
3364079 comes as close to infanticide as anything i have seen in our judiciary
3364080 women intuitively know that most heterosexual males find extraordinarily beautiful women sexually irresistible and if that extraordinarily beautiful woman wanted her man he would be hers for the taking
3364081 i should write that down thatd be an awesome story

3364087 dont pick any call of 88888888 as its some type of a virus which damage the brains cells and kills persons as some high tone sound or some thing produce when u pick the calls it damage or burst he brain in few seconds
3364088 these rumors are completely baseless they do not make any sense in technological terms

3364090 at the end of the day it all comes down to service to our customers
3364091 consumers failure to adequately fund its forestry program for several years has compromised service reliability quality and safety
3364092 i tried calling dte all night to report the outage but there was a message stating my call could not be completed or i got a busy signal
3364093 i dont think anyone would say that 100 000 customers out is a normal day

3364097 we are deeply concerned over the deteriorating situation in iok which is resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people we call for immediate steps to end violence against innocent kashmiris
3364098 it is important that an enabling environment free of violence is created to sustain peace process and address the long standing dispute of jammu and kashmir
3364099 pakistan calls for immediate steps to address the situation and prevent the human rights violations in the indian occupied jammu and kashmir
3364100 declaring the du north campus as tobacco free is one of my biggest achievements last month we invited the health minister to our campus and he was very impressed with the whole scenario and supported our campaign whole heartedly
3364101 many students after being fined for smoking in the campus used to come to me and say that this is a habit that they simply cannot give up because they are addicted to smoking that was a clear signal that a rehabilitation centre was what they needed and not just campaigns
3364102 my tenure comes to an end in a few days as re elections will be held september 5 however whether we stay in power or not care will be taken that privacy of the students who come to the rehab centre will be given top priority the centre will be both media and parents attention proof
3364103 at the college many students take to smoking as a style statement they are dependent on the idea of looking cool for which they smoke not because they are addicted to smoking itself
3364104 although not many student smokers are addicted to smoking they just might be so in future if not helped and since most of them would not like to reveal these things to their parents the assurance that his or her privacy will be maintained is a good thing it is a good step
3364105 this competition is long and i need to stay good
3364106 we have 12 players if i dont feel good its a problem for them
3364107 without him brazil defeated serbia 3 1 25 27 25 20 25 17 25 21 the brazilians who are ranked no
3364108 i think theres a lot of water to go under the bridge in this tournament yet
3364109 were going to go away from this and take a lot of positive out of what we did and the way we finished the game and really attack germany because three points there can put us in a very very good position for the rest of the tournament
3364110 its definitely something weve identified as a group that needs to be addressed and needs to change
3364111 the fact that we can turn it up shows how good we can be its frustrating as a group to know that its there and for us not to do it for the full 70 minutes is something we really need to focus in on
3364112 in the second half although the u s team scored a goal and tied with us our team numbers show very good
3364113 i do still think we have hope of winning a medal
3364114 japan scored first when kaori chiba deflected a long pass by sakae morimoto 12 minutes into the match
3364115 americans usually see individuals chinese and other asians see contexts
3364116 americans are more likely to see categories asians are more likely to see relationships
3364117 the ceremony drew from chinas long history but surely the most striking features were the images of thousands of chinese moving as one drumming as one dancing as one sprinting on precise formations without ever stumbling or colliding weve seen displays of mass conformity before but this was collectivism of the present a high tech vision of the harmonious society performed in the context of chinas miraculous growth
3364118 when i think about pickles i just want to throw up and run away
3364119 obviously its a long way away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s then trying to play great doubles
3364120 its an honour to compete in the olympics its been great
3364121 im playing for a medal but i have to get there first that will be the ultimate goal for me
3364122 we decided to respect the decision by the association taking into account that the recovery of her injury is not going well
3364123 the chinese fight when they are down and never give you anything so it was nice to turn the tables
3364124 robertson and emms won the silver medal in athens four years ago and said they have only one goal here in beijing
3364125 we only came here for the gold we won silver last time so we only want to win the gold
3364126 robertson scored the winning point with a cross court smash and pumped his first before embracing emms it was a setback for the host nation which is hoping to dominate the olympic badminton tournament after wining three of five golds in athens

3364147 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscar
3364148 no changes or cuts to the film will be made tropic thunder is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3364149 look if it makes you people happy tom cruise came to the premiere dressed like a retard okay take a look at his goddamn sneakers thats short bus if i ever saw it stuff that in your wheel locks and drool on it
3364150 one more painful reminder that progress in confronting the drug problem comes at tremendous sacrifice
3364151 the american government has a long history of arming rebel groups in poor countries where they feel a change in government would be profitable to its corporations
3364152 even after you modify chinas growth rate down its still showing very strong and solid growth forecasts in the coming years
3364153 the upside should be better than the downside at the moment and we dont think we have much further to go
3364154 when i was here a year ago you had a stock market which was booming and you had the currency appreciating
3364155 when one region one asset class one type of customer are conservative the others may be growing so you get a nice mix and youre still able to grow your business
3364156 personally i would not describe it as a bear market in commodities because i believe global demand will still put upward pressure on the prices particularly growth in emerging markets such as asia where theres a lot of consumer demand
3364157 we have checked those and there are no reports of any impact to any of the pipelines

3364160 she retracted within two days of the complaint the reason she didnt go through with the video is because she didnt want it to go too far
3364161 what you did is falsely accuse a man who had done you no harm at all of a very serious sexual offence
3364162 there was a comparatively long period when the man was at risk of being arrested you told lie after lie after lie
3364163 in december you were still telling lies saying something must have happened
3364164 you actually went to a hotel with the man when you were confronted with that you admitted what you had done

3364185 penn made the decision that he wants to fight gsp and i tell you what as a fan i want to see that fight
3364186 its a risky move and some people have criticized me for it but i still want to get another fight in before the years end and i want to fight someone tough
3364187 it was a stupid stupid stupid stupid fight on my behalf and i take the full blame 100 percent for it ill take it right on the forehead like i took those hundred elbows from maia
3364188 that is why the people are happy that u s forces are doing this
3364189 they have asked for our assistance and we have been able to provide it
3364190 and the reason we are able to provide it is because we have this great cooperation with the afghan army the police our british allies and of course our troops are out here doing a fantastic job as well
3364191 we have worked with the u s before at the ali khail school when i first got here in may
3364192 enjoying working together once again supporting each other and the afghan national security forces to make things a bit safer
3364193 we are just the outer piece and they are doing the real hard work of making sure that anyone who gets into the clinic to be seen incidentally by afghan doctors are secure
3364194 we go to the shuras meetings to talk to the elders about the health problems of the men women and children of the community
3364195 we allow them to take care of their people we provide the medications and advice on prescribing and then dispersing them
3364196 the primary thing we need built in our area is a clinic
3364197 and now we are happy that the u s forces will build a clinic in the village for us and they are already starting to work on it
3364198 what bothers my sister so much is her son was left dying on the street and two children were left tending her son that cuts her to the core she feels so much responsibility for those boys
3364199 when you hit somebody and they land on your hood and windshield the first reaction is you get out and say are you hurt
3364200 there is absolutely no justification for him not stopping and helping he should have stopped and rendered assistance
3364201 i want this family to understand this was not somebody wanting to get away with it
3364202 its so huge the void and the extreme hurt in our family its almost unbearable the pain

3364205 it came out of the air in a nosedive and just exploded
3364206 there was no fire no nothing it just hit the ground so hard
3364207 i thought we were pretty lightweight in wide areas and deans a very capable player in the wide area so i have brought him in to have a good look at him in training and because we are not blessed with a huge amount of wide players
3364208 michael is a great pro he has had a horrendous past in terms of his nasty injury
3364209 im delighted he is back fit and healthy and his return added further strength as far as numbers are concerned to the defence
3364210 keith is reasonably hopeful of being able to play in the scotland game but of course it is of prime importance that we have him ready to face slovakia
3364211 i spoke to the coaching staff at celtic to see how he has doing since moving to the club
3364212 unfortunately pat has been struggling with a hamstring injury since he signed and he only played his first game last tuesday night
3364213 fitness wise he is somewhere off the mark and it was decided that he would be better off staying at his club and getting some work in to improve his fitness
3364214 this will be a great test for the side and no disrespect to a lesser team in the rankings this is a great game for the supporters players and having the old british championship pride in there is tremendous
3364215 its one of those friendlies that isnt a friendly and the players will be treating it that way
3364216 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that
3364217 when i told chief executive martin bain on sunday that i wanted to leave i did so with sadness
3364218 the rangers supporters have been fantastic to me but i am young and want to play at the highest level
3364219 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club
3364220 the club has received a substantial uplift in fee and we will now reinvest in the team
3364221 roy rang me to see how things were going and asked me if he was going to be number one
3364222 no one is number one in my eyes in any position because it is performance level related and confidence is also a factor among other things
3364223 how could i change the situation after the way that maik taylor has played
3364224 the way he is on and off the pitch is a managers dream and roy thought it would be a little bit hard for him to be travelling around europe maybe being number two three goalkeeper
3364225 weve agreed that should there be an injury suspension a loss of confidence or form between the goalkeepers we have got then roy is available
3364226 i have had the pleasure of working with alfie wylie and steve beaglehole for five days out of seven at the milk cup so i know a lot of the boys quite well
3364227 i was very impressed with manchester city player ryan mcgivern i watched him closely he is a good young professional with the right attitude and he is a very good player
3364228 adam chapman at sheffield united is also progressing nicely although he still has a lot of work to do
3364229 andrew little keeps telling me that rangers are trying to convert him into a centre half but for me hes as good a centre forward as you will get at that age
3364230 those players can make the step up but if all my senior players are fit i would like those players to stay within their own age groups
3364231 i dont see michaels exclusion as being long term and i know that nigel will continue to be actively looking at local talent
3364232 not one board member or myself have been contacted about this
3364233 i think you can read between the lines on that one
3364234 the attorney generals office has told us not to give out information
3364235 i dont know of any issues that have come up
3364236 additionally this office is not equipped to conduct investigations grand jury or otherwise
3364237 we employ no investigators rather we rely on police agencies to provide our investigative services
3364238 the das not going to convene a grand jury unless he has something
3364239 its a sad day for this county when the district attorney wont meet with a citizen group
3364240 it seems the district attorney in franklin county is more than willing to investigate wind companies
3364241 i said we had evidence of wrongdoing in steuben county including members of the legislature which is something entirely different
3364242 ok so the other two are hot big deal my man is freakin ben hes eeevil or is he pay up
3364243 we look forward to continuing to work with the town of prattsburgh and its residents and appreciate the strong support the project has received
3364244 thats totally out of the question we dont make enough from the antennas on that tower to make it worthwhile
3364245 he has a very radical view of whats a family
3364246 i really felt that as chief justice i had to have the broad shoulders because i knew there would be substantial controversy about it
3364247 most people thought his legacy would be the modernization of the courts
3364248 well that was a little scarier than it had to be
3364249 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3364250 there is love of course and then theres life its enemy
3364251 japanese players train notoriously hard but this is a longer season than hes used to
3364252 there is more travel in the major leagues and farther travel its more grueling than in japan where the cities are closer together and you take high speed trains between cities your body wears down
3364253 throw in the fact that theres been a lot of attention and hype surrounding him all season long and you can see how he might break down as stoic as japanese players are it still affects you hes going through a funk and a couple days off might help
3364254 for a guy that really played with a lot of pain and injury he did a good job johnson said
3364255 im happy with him happy with his progress he just needs to play more
3364256 im a little banged up small injuries here and there laws said
3364257 i felt i did pretty good i made some decent plays tons to work on a lot of good film to study
3364258 he just keeps making threats saying how im not going to live
3364259 i believed i was a young untouchable great singer who could do whatever he wanted whenever he wanted
3364260 i had an image of myself and when things change or life moves on thats when people struggle
3364261 for me that happened at quite a young age i had to make major decisions in my life that upset the image i had of myself i had to accept i had to lose the image of myself
3364262 just little things like that change your perspective of who you are
3364263 touring america changed me a lot i became greedy it was all about wants and needs and thats not me as a human being
3364264 thats not the kind of person i am and i didnt like the person id become
3364265 i was putting myself under a lot of pressure and allowing past failures and things like that to control the moment instead of just expressing myself like i used to be able to
3364266 id lost that especially as a performer i was half the singer i used to be
3364267 do you know that fella gollum from lord of the rings it was a really mild version of that
3364268 i kept thinking hang on a sec ive should have a good life here why am i feeling this way
3364269 im in what i believe to be one of the best bands in the country and im sat panicking about random stuff distorted thoughts
3364270 suicide became an option i became a very unhappy young man but even suicide is the act of an ego thats the final act of an ego to protect oneself from being wrong
3364271 when your bodys physically shaking and you cant keep still and youre sweating and youre sat watching your tv and your hearts like a machine gun thats when i got to the point where i was thinking theres something not right here
3364272 which is what i needed to hear so i checked in and got myself sorted for a few weeks
3364273 after that its just been constant care and attention ive been sober for two and a half years now
3364274 staying fit eating well seeing a regular therapist whenever i can whenever ive got things to talk about
3364275 stay present as opposed to living in the past or the future
3364276 you just need to look down the song titles to know that

3364330 loretta mi ha raccontato di aver sentito alla radio che una percentuale di bambini in questo paese viene allevata dai nonni non mi ricordo quantera ma mi sembrata proprio alta figli che i genitori non volevano tirare su ne abbiamo parlato io e loretta e abbiamo pensato a questo quando arriver la prossima generazione e neanche quella vorr tirare su i propri figli allora chi ci penser i loro genitori saranno gli unici nonni disponibil e neanche loro vorranno tirarli su non abbiamo saputo dare una risposta nei giorni buoni mi dico che c qualcosa che non capisco o che non metto in conto ma quei giorni sono rari certe volte mi sveglio in piena notte e mi sento sicuro come la morte che solo la seconda venuta di cristo potr fermare questo andazzoo non so a che serve stare svegli a pensarci ma mi capita
3364331 ecco un paio di anni fa io e loretta siamo andati a una conferenza a corpus christi e io mi sono ritrovato seduto vicino ad una signora la moglie di non so chi e continuava a parlare della destra che aveva fatto questaltro non sono nemmeno sicuro di avere capito qual era il punto la gente che conosco io perlopi gente comune persone semplici come si suol dire io glielho detto e lei mi ha guardato strano pensava che ne stessi parlando male ma ovviamente nel mio mondo un gran complimento e ha continuato con la sua filippica alla fine mi ha detto non mi piace la direzione in cui sta andando questo paese voglio che mia nipote sia libera di abortire e io le ho risposto guardi signora secondo me non si deve preoccupare della direzione in cui va il paese per come la vedo io non c il minimo dubbio che sua nipote potr abortire anzi le dir non solo sar libera di abortire ma sar anche libera di mandarla al creatore e in pratica il discorso finito l
3364332 io gli ho risposto che una volta un avvocato mi aveva detto che alluniversit cercano di insegnarti a non pensare a cosa giusto e a cosa sbagliato ma solo a seguire la legge e che per questo discorso non mi convinceva tanto lui ci ha pensato un po ha annuito e ha detto che pi o meno era daccordo con quellavvocato che se uno non segue la legge il giusto e lo sbagliato non lo possono salvare e a me questo sembra una cosa sensata ma non basta a farmi cambiare idea alla fome gli ho chiseto se sapeva chi era mammona e lui mammona

3364339 full time education in the home by a parent or guardian who does not necessarily possess a teaching credential
3364340 we will conclude that 1 california statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education and 2 the statutory permission to home school may constitutionally be overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who has been declared dependent
3364341 primarily based on its view that parents have an absolute constitutional right to home school their children
3364342 1 california statutory law does not permit home schooling and 2 this prohibition does not violate the u s constitution
3364343 1 additional california statutes that might bear upon the issue and 2 potentially applicable provisions of the california constitution
3364344 it is important to recognize that it is not for us to consider as a matter of policy whether home schooling should be permitted in california that job is for the legislature it is not the duty of the courts to make the law we endeavor to interpret it
3364345 our first task interpreting the law of california is made more difficult in this case by legislative inaction as we will discuss at length below home schooling was initially expressly permitted in california when the compulsory education law was enacted in 1903 in 1929 however home schooling was amended out of the law and children who were not educated in pubic or private schools could be taught privately only by a credentialed tutor case law in 1953 and 1961 confirmed this interpretation and specifically concluded that a home school could not be considered a private school while the legislature could have amended the statutes in response to these cases to expressly provide that a home school could be a private school it did not do so thus as of that time given the history of the statutes and the legislatures implied concurrence in the case law interpreting them the conclusion that home schooling was not permitted in california would seem to follow
3364346 although the legislature did not amend the statutory scheme so as to expressly permit home schooling more recent enactments demonstrate an apparent acceptance by the legislature of the proposition that home schooling is taking place in california with home schools allowed as private schools recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california home school their children by declaring their homes to be private schools moreover several statutory enactments indicate a legislative approval of home schooling by exempting home schools from requirements otherwise applicable to private schools we are therefore confronted with 1 compulsory education statutes which were apparently intended to eliminate the permission previously granted to home school and 2 later enactments which reflect the legislatures understanding that the compulsory education statutes permit home schooling as a species of private school education under these circumstances it is our view that the proper course of action is to interpret the earlier statutes in light of the later ones and to recognize as controlling the legislatures apparent acceptance of the proposition that home schools are permissible in california when conducted as private schools
3364347 it is clear that some form of home schooling may be permissible under these statutes when the independent study is under the general supervision of a credentialed employee of the school district or county office of education
3364348 it cannot reasonably be argued that home schooling conducted by a parent who is not a certified teacher satisfies the private tutor exemption from the compulsory education law
3364349 statutory language is ambiguous on the question of a home school as a private school
3364350 has acted as though home schooling is in fact permitted in california
3364351 we find it significant that education and enforcement officials at both the state and local levels agree that home schools may constitute private schools
3364352 it is estimated that there are 166 000 children being home schooled in california it is a growing practice across the nation the legislature is aware that home schooling parents file affidavits as private schools and has passed laws based on that awareness the department of education has not challenged the practice and the lausd has not asserted that the children of such parents are truant
3364353 we conclude that an order requiring a dependent child to attend school outside the home in order to protect that childs safety is not an unconstitutional violation of the parents right to direct the education of their children
3364354 specifically it is undisputed that a dependency court has the statutory authority to order that a dependent child attend school if within the best interests of the childs safety it is argued that this restriction is an unconstitutional violation of parents right to direct the education of their children we conclude that the restriction is constitutional
3364355 in this case the dependency court declined to consider whether sending jonathan and mary grace to public or traditional private school was necessary y to preserve their safety because it believed that parents posses an absolute constitutional right to home school this is incorrect no such absolute right to home school exists
3364356 the statutory permission to homeschool may constitutionally be overridden in order to protect the safety of a child who has been declared dependent

3364420 the concern here is that at a minimum this is going to add volatility to the region and polarize the uighur and chinese communities
3364421 there is also a fear the government will launch a widespread indiscriminate repressive campaign targeted far beyond the groups advocating use of violence
3364422 we can see that the attackers are merciless fugitives so the government should be on high alert
3364423 because they cannot carry out such attacks in their most desirable cities like beijing they have to turn to local locations
3364424 their methods are quite similar to some other international terrorist attacks

3364448 we expect sales to be lower than last year and prices to stabilize and maybe fall slightly
3364449 this might be fairly pessimistic as we are yet to see what effect the offering of mortgages by turkish banks to foreigners will have on the market

3364616 en econom a lo m s importante es la confianza y si zapatero no transmite confianza en lo econ mico y su equipo econ mico no le transmite confianza al propio zapatero alguien tendr que hacer algo para que la crisis sea un poco m s leve a partir del mes de septiembre
3364617 le pedimos para las pr ximas 48 horas a zapatero que adopte medidas que de verdad sirvan para que la macroeconom a espa ola sufra un poco menos durante los pr ximos meses y en particular le pedimos que adopte medidas en relaci n al sostenimiento del empleo y con el pago de las hipotecas porque los espa oles han invertido en vivienda y ven como cada d a van empobreci ndose
3364618 pasamos por un momento complicado desde el punto de vista econ mico que hace que las comunidades aut nomas no sepan c mo elaborar el presupuesto del a o que viene y nadie les est dando una pista de por d nde pueden ir los presupuestos del estado por tanto los presupuestos auton micos y municipales del a o que viene
3364619 hay un proceso paralelo abierto con catalu a por la aplicaci n del estatuto y por tanto un incumplimiento legal por parte del gobierno de zapatero que no ha cumplido el plazo del estatuto de catalu a

3364621 una respuesta del presidente del gobierno al parlamento de espa a y a todos los espa oles ya que en los ltimos d as est creciendo la sensaci n que espa a tiene un gobierno de coalici n ya que en el gobierno de espa a no hay s lo socialistas sino que tambi n hay nacionalistas catalanes del psoe uno es el psoe de zapatero y otro el psoe de montilla
3364622 no tenemos un gobierno monocolor tenemos un gobierno de coalici n de socialistas espa oles con socialistas catalanes
3364623 es obligaci n del presidente del gobierno aclarar las condiciones de esa coalici n las posibilidades que hay de que esa coalici n se rompa y cu l es el precio que el partido mayoritario de la coalici n est pagando al partido minoritario de la misma
3364624 cuando el psc le dice al psoe que o le hace caso en la demanda de financiaci n o no votar los pge del a o que viene el psc se est comportando como un partido minoritario en una coalici n de gobierno
3364625 si tenemos un gobierno de coalici n en espa a si zapatero no est gobernando tenemos que saber todos quien es su compa ero de viaje y que precio paga por esa compa a
3364626 los espa oles tienen derecho a saber si con el dinero de sus impuestos se va a pagar la propuesta de financiaci n de los socialistas catalanes
3364627 los espa oles tienen derecho a saber lo que se est jugando por debajo de la mesa cuando los reproches que se cruzan el gobierno socialista de madrid y el gobierno socialista de barcelona son tan subidos de tono quiere decir que algo est ocurriendo detr s de la cortina y el resto de espa oles no nos estamos enterando

3364637 en catalu a hace falta una financiaci n justa es verdad que en materia de financiaci n tiene retrasos importantes relativos a infraestructuras tener una posici n conjunta con el resto de los partidos catalanes al margen del estatut yo creo que es la postura coherente del ppc
3364638 brillan por su ausencia medidas que de verdad est n produciendo aut nticos efectos en la econom a llevamos desde la legislatura pasada sin hacer pr cticamente nada y cuando viene encima una situaci n de crisis como ya se apuntaba desde hace pr cticamente un a o el gobierno no lo reconoce como vulgarmente se dice nos han cogido con los deberes sin hacer
3364639 es muy dif cil poder afirmar que se est n haciendo las cosas bien o que se est n tomando medidas que de verdad vayan encaminadas a frenar la escalada de incremento del paro nosotros pensamos que el gobierno puede estar haciendo alguna cosa pero eficaz ninguna

3364654 but i think a lot of it is in the sentiment i think a lot of artists overstate what theyre trying to say like i think most of the stuff that all of us sing about we could make pretty concise i just think there are a lot of bands who dwell too much on what theyre trying to get across
3364655 it seems quite absurd to be in the position weve got to because the ambition was never really to get where we are it was just to make music really and contemporary artists i listen to are never on the radio or never sell any records its very weird to be in a position where its crossed over but i think thats probably just how things happen really

3364715 when you go to the olympics you do represent your country
3364716 its very very difficult to say im shedding my nationality at the door and im just going to be a human being competing against another human being nationalism is a very very powerful force in history
3364717 by basing competition on nationality i think it became inevitable that there would be political overtones to this game
3364718 hitlers government was trying to use the olympics to publicize the virtues and accomplishments of the nazi regime
3364719 what could possibly be political about a man running in a sprint well if you look at the circumstances its an african american in nazi germany with doctrines of racial superiority yes its much more than sports
3364720 what jesse owens did is strike a great blow for human equality and racial equality if we didnt see that then all we saw was a man running a race
3364721 both the soviet union and the u s viewed the olympic games as a kind of symbol of confrontation between the two countries somehow if we won more medals than the russians we were proving that our system was better than the russians and vice versa
3364722 cheated out of the gold medal by some very very strange and politicized call
3364723 i remember being outraged by that and frankly its been 36 years since that happened and im still outraged by it
3364724 that is an indication that during the cold war feelings of nationalism in the olympics ran very very deep
3364725 things were much more clear cut during the cold war we had an enemy we were their enemy and everybody knew the score i dont think that will be the case today our greatest enemy is al qaida politically at this point and theyre obviously not sending a team to the olympics
3364726 im sure millions and millions of people will watch it but i dont think its going to be the same as it was when the u s played the soviets

3364734 part of the fun of going to a baseball game is catching a foul ball but that also creates a rash of injuries
3364735 assumes all risk and danger incidental to the sport of baseball
3364736 especially if you are sitting behind the first base and third base sides the unprotected areas if im a parent im going to have my child sitting next to me away from the batter
3364737 when you see how many foul balls go into the stands its pretty frightening
3364738 i go to minor league games and im amazed at how many parents bring their children to field level and ignore them youre asking for it pay attention but really parents shouldnt let their kids sit so close to the field the ball comes in at 100 mph and theres little to no time to react

3364742 even though refinancing borrowers who take out a one year adjustable rate mortgage today would save about three quarters of a percentage point in rate relative to a five year arm or 15 year fixed rate mortgage the concerns about inflationary pressures leading to future interest rate increases may be causing borrowers to choose the safety and certainty of fixed rates
3364743 teaser rates on arms have largely disappeared during the second quarter the initial interest rate on one year arms averaged three tenths of a percentage point higher than the fully indexed rate without an extra discount arms just arent attracting many borrowers in todays market

3364883 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3364884 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3364885 is about to make one of the most important decisions of this campaign choosing a running mate
3364886 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3364887 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3364888 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3364889 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3364890 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3364891 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3364892 these battleground states are good reflections of the nation as a whole
3364893 the youth vote both religious and non religious are likely to show the same patterns at the national level if they religious youth can have an impact nationally they will have an impact in the battleground states
3364894 the abandoning of politics as usual an opportunity for the underrepresented to have a voice
3364895 obama is the face of the christian youth generation moreso than anybody else
3364896 a vast majority of my friends believe mccain is the face of the christian youth vote today
3364897 upholds the christian values and he acknowledges that god should be kept in public places
3364898 young religious voters are looking for a president who will keep our nation safe while expanding economic opportunity and promoting our common values in this election young religious voters will see that john mccain has the leadership values and vision we need in our next president
3364899 our campaign is reaching out to young people of all faiths including evangelicals by holding house parties hosting events with key supporters and even holding rock concerts faith has been an important part of senator obamas life and he shares the commitment that millions of young evangelicals and people of all faith have to changing the world around them
3364900 a lot of people who will vote for mccain because of his view on israel and a lot of people will vote for obama because of his view of change and his objectivity to tackle foreign policy issues
3364901 because of the nature of the contest this time around both parties having highly contesting races
3364902 in touch with issues that matter to young people and he views them as beneficiaries to todays policies
3364903 what i am when i hear him is inspired and i dont get that from other politicians
3364904 mccain has a stronger allegiance and better stance on israel
3364905 there is more to electing the next president of the united states than being a good speaker
3364906 turnout is critical and the only votes that count are the votes that are cast
3364907 a new rasmussen poll of iowa shows that barack obamas lead is starting to slip
3364908 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
3364909 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3364910 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line
3364911 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3364912 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3364913 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3364914 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3364915 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
3364916 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
3364917 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
3364918 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
3364919 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
3364920 my experience as a missionary teacher in africa opened my eyes to this simple fact without access to energy life is brutal and short
3364921 environmentalists will be forced to compromise next year and support the development of clean coal nuclear power and other alternative fuels
3364922 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3364923 im having a belvedere in your honour the mountains are fantastic fabulous colours in the high desert will say hi at pasquals for you
3364924 i know there is a little mini panic going on in the ranks of not a few democrats and the chattering classes but with o in hawaii the nation on vacation the tv full of the olympics phelps romping in the pool and georgia on my mind i just want to say hey its august chill
3364925 the unreal is the paris britney obama glam rock nonsense the latest example of which is
3364926 the more team mccain does this as much as it obviously gets their ya yas out the more they demean their candidate
3364927 this country faces immense issues and it is not a time for insipid parodies and you know what the american people understand it and they want more from the men who are asking for their vote to be president of the united states so the mccain frat boys can act out as much as they want
3364928 the unreal is thinking that obama has peaked in the high 40s in virtually all the polls but not understanding that it is mccain who may have peaked in the low 40s where he has been stuck in virtually all the polls
3364929 what is real is race the industrial states and commander in chief
3364930 this election brings us into new territory the country has never gone through this before
3364931 you ask americans where georgia is and they think it is somewhere near atlanta
3364932 so the handwringers are wailing that we are only slightly up in august but guess what we are up in august and we will still peak in late october
3364933 hey you got sms in australia we want to text you on the vp the moment barack makes his decision as we told our troops
3364934 thanks for giving me an excuse to sip the belvedere love taos and santa fe chill baby
3364935 they can buy a locomotive anyplace in the world they can buy it anyplace in the world but they buy it here because its the most fuel efficient and its the most environmentally sound and it requires the least maintenance
3364936 i want you and every american to tell the congress that when we start anew in january of 2009 lets sit down together republican and democrat libertarian vegetarian whoever it is lets sit down together and start working on these problems together and put our country first
3364937 now if youd just raise your hand we have some people with a microphone or if youd like to go back to work whichever
3364938 where did the internet come from besides al gore and by the way i have great respect for vice president gore
3364939 eighty four percent of the american people think that the countrys on the wrong track congress has a 9 percent approval rating now you get down to 9 percent youre down to paid staffers and blood relatives you cant get much lower than that
3364940 um call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking and get him to work
3364941 who will be the next president of the united states
3364942 the most productive and most competitive worker in the world resides in the united states of america
3364943 drilling offshore isnt the answer either but its a bridge its an important bridge to exploit our own oil and natural gas reserves while were making this transition that we must make to energy independence
3364944 i liked what he had to say today i want to hear more of what hes going to do to solve our issues
3364945 its a very important thing to do in life vote for someone thats going to run your future
3364946 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3364947 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3364948 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3364949 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3364950 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3364951 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3364952 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
3364953 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
3364954 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3364955 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3364956 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3364957 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3364958 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3364959 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3364960 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3364961 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3364962 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3364963 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
3364964 could ralph naders entrance and exit have helped al gore the impact of decoy dynamics on consumer choice
3364965 we found that the entrance and exit of a third option the nader effect can profoundly impact consumers preference
3364966 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favorite even if they werent before
3364967 we also call this effect the phantom decoy effect because like pre announced software that is never released these desirable options that become unavailable may never actually exist
3364968 the increase in affinity that a product may receive when a decoy option real or not is removed can mark a significant change in consumer choice
3364969 in terms of elections even a 5 percent increase in preference makes a huge difference at the ballot box
3364970 one can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it
3364971 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3364972 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3364973 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3364974 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3364975 despite the difficulties in a separation we do believe the company is shopping the iden business
3364976 however at this point we dont know what assets are included in the proposed sale the ebitda it generates or the debt that goes with it making an analysis of a transaction difficult
3364977 every option is on the table and every option will continue to be considered
3364978 we thought our climb was over but couldnt go down our ascent route
3364979 alpinism is not just death tragedy survival and heroism we hope our climb will serve as a reminder that mountaineers like us and many others climb mountains to live to enjoy to grow and to accept the verdicts of life and sometimes also of fate without arguing or lacking respect toward those who share the same value the value of life
3364980 this year a passing will be impossible for a small boat as you can see on the ice situation map end of july 2008
3364981 arctic ice has diminished but theres more ice in antarctica now truth is about 2 3rd of total north pole ice always melts by the end of the northern summer this summer it got down to about 1 4 of the winter amount it is much less alarming if you consider that the total between the 2 poles only represents about a 5 reduction from normal
3364982 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3364983 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3364984 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
3364985 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
3364986 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3364987 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3364988 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3364989 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3364990 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3364991 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3364992 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3364993 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3364994 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3364995 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3364996 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3364997 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3364998 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3364999 our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity later in this century and in the next on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century
3365000 it doesnt matter if global warming is true or not we all want cleaner air
3365001 it doesnt matter if iraq had weapons of mass destruction saddam was a cruel and ruthless dictator who oppressed and murdered his people
3365002 once they are gone youll go back to sucking down the equivalent of a cigarette drag every time you breathe outdoors
3365003 it is all just mist does anybody think that china would ever consider cooking the books on aug 10 ap measured 604 micrograms m 3 the bbc measured 278 in another location and beijings air quality index which is supposed to be the highest of many different readings measured 82
3365004 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3365005 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3365006 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3365007 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3365008 anyone whos paid attention knows that obama makes many more gaffes than mccain
3365009 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3365010 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3365011 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
3365012 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
3365013 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
3365014 historically presidential nominations were decided at the party conventions and as a result the vice presidential running mates were also selected at the conventions gallups jeff jones notes
3365015 that made it difficult to disentangle the effect of naming a vice presidential running mate on a candidates support from the
3365016 the small window of time after the announcement of a presidential candidates running mate but before the convention has taken place
3365017 similar to the pattern seen with clinton in 1996 support for gore held steady during bushs vice presidential selection phase at 41 percent
3365018 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3365019 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3365020 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3365021 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3365022 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3365023 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3365024 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3365025 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3365026 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3365027 tortures avec actes de barbarie par personne d positaire de lautorit publique
3365028 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3365029 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3365030 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3365031 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3365032 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3365033 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3365034 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3365035 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3365036 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3365037 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3365038 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3365039 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3365040 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3365041 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3365042 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3365043 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3365044 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3365045 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3365046 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3365047 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3365048 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3365049 my goal for upper arlington is for obama to win to get 51 percent
3365050 we had people write checks saying im sick of seeing their signs
3365051 in this community theres probably a lot of people who are still waiting for obama to start to make some specifics where people can hang their hats and say yeah this is the change that were looking for
3365052 you dont want to step outside the boundaries and we did
3365053 we wanted to reach out to those people who might have shied away from confrontation with their neighbors or family members
3365054 there are good muslims and bad muslims that i have to admit just like there are good and bad jews
3365055 no this was their place first they could take the hot weather and some of them went far in this world theyre not lazy
3365056 i know hes smart i dont think hes a dummy like bush
3365057 im fine i have to go for blood work again they keep me waiting for an hour im all sunburned like a berry i get in the water and i forget to get out i get in conversations
3365058 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3365059 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3365060 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3365061 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3365062 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3365063 just so you all know we did set a record
3365064 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3365065 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3365066 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3365067 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3365068 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3365069 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3365070 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3365071 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3365072 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3365073 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3365074 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3365075 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3365076 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3365077 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3365078 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3365079 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3365080 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3365081 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3365082 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3365083 theres no more important voter in this media market than the hispanic swing vote
3365084 i think people like me feel proud of being in a thinking process rather than just going with one party
3365085 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3365086 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3365087 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3365088 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3365089 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3365090 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3365091 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3365092 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3365093 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3365094 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3365095 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3365096 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3365097 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3365098 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3365099 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3365100 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3365101 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3365102 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
3365103 are you better off now than you were four years ago
3365104 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
3365105 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
3365106 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
3365107 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3365108 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3365109 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presence that draws you in
3365110 al gore is one of the few public figures challenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
3365111 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3365112 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3365113 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3365114 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3365115 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3365116 their tax plan operates under the old theory that the best way to feed the birds is to give more oats to the horse
3365117 i did something thats not normal for politicians but its normal for people
3365118 se trata de que los que usan software libre son consumidores y productores al mismo tiempo
3365119 se debe entender como un proceso de generaci n de programas que funcionen desde el principio
3365120 la universidad de granada crea su oficina de software libre
3365121 es pr cticamente imposible encontrar un solo suspenso en los expedientes que se presentan para homologar el t tulo con uno oficial
3365122 en conclusi n no podemos pagar justos por pecadores y como alguien ha repetido en este blog no se puede generalizar que no todas las universidades privadas son iguales
3365123 cientos de alumnos logran t tulos irregulares avalados por la universidad de gales
3365124 despu s de 4 a os estudiando como un carb n
3365125 que profesores pasados de vuelta viejos sin experiencia en el mundo de la empresa
3365126 eleg cesine por que ofrec an pr cticas remuneradas a partir de segundo a o de carrera y garantizas
3365127 he estado trabajando de becario en christian salvensen gerposa y banca privada del banco santander
3365128 donde te da clase un funcionario que para el no eres mas que un simple numero y que no le interesas lo mas minimo
3365129 es que acaso es bueno un profesor que suspende al 80 de los alumnos
3365130 amigos m os ac rrimos 100 a la educaci n publica han llegado a decir que si hubiese arquitectura en cesine se quitar an de la universidad de cantabria y cursar an en cesine la carrera
3365131 esta vez el rector de la universidad de cantabria ha ido mas lejos
3365132 yo estoy orgulloso si orgulloso de haber estudiado en cesine y lo volveria hacer y como yo muchos compa eros mios
3365133 y aun siendo respetuoso y cometido para evitar acciones legales por parte de la uc
3365134 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
3365135 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
3365136 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
3365137 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
3365138 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
3365139 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3365140 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3365141 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3365142 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3365143 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3365144 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3365145 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3365146 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3365147 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3365148 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3365149 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3365150 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3365151 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3365152 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3365153 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3365154 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3365155 i think it was one of those memos that was written looked at by the candidate and wisely discarded
3365156 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3365157 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters and then produces a strategy that all through the summer and into the fall and almost up to iowa is cautious calculating triangulating and is basically a replica of president clintons 1996 reelection strategy when he had no competitive primaries i mean its undeniable that she ran on inevitability she ran as the candidate of the establishment she ran as a quasi incumbent in a year of change it was a terrible mistake so if mark penn understood what the targets were in march maybe they should have come up with a strategy that would have reached those targets
3365158 campaign it seems from these memos to have been at least as focused on the staff going after each other as they were on going after the nomination and getting past barack obama
3365159 by the way one thing we shouldnt ignore in all of this they can all stand around pointing fingers at each other theyre not pointing fingers at the one person who deserves the most blame for their defeat and that is barack obama
3365160 he was an extraordinary candidate who resonated with what america feels and felt and what democrats felt as he went through those primaries
3365161 theres a certain strength in the sense of centeredness and almost the serenity that the obama campaign has displayed
3365162 they have a strategy theyve executed it consistently they dont get thrown off by day to day polls i remember last september there were all these people who were saying obama is behind clinton hes got to go out and hes got to attack her hes got to run negative ads and some of his own people and fundraising people said that and he held a conference call and he said im not doing that i know what the strategy is i know what i want to say i know how to reach people now ill tell you something youre a lot better off in a campaign with a strategy consistently adhered to than with 20 people debating ten competing strategies moving day to day
3365163 i think its ugly and i think if hillary clinton had done that she would have permanently besmirched her reputation her legacy and her place in american politics
3365164 barry and his 300 advisors are no match for putin hed spin the junior senator like a top and play him like a fiddle
3365165 barack obama while on vacation still managed to handle the crisis between russia and georgia better than trigger happy mccain john mccain was ready to wage war with russia because he thought that they attacked atlanta if he had any soldiers in his army after his brilliant surge in iraq he could send them to fight russia
3365166 it took the race card to defeat the clintons and they resent the hell out of it
3365167 hillary fought a tough battle made mistakes that cost the nomination
3365168 it was written well before he went into politics and it was not ghost written
3365169 why are people still arguing about hillary and obama this entire election will boil down to one factor race like bob kerrey said if obama was a tall skinny white guy named paul jones the election is a different story
3365170 is there anything obama can learn from this story and these memos
3365171 its interesting if somebody produces a memo that says we need to go after these invisibles lower income voters women blue collar voters
3365172 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3365173 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3365174 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3365175 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3365176 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3365177 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3365178 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3365179 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3365180 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3365181 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3365182 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3365183 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3365184 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3365185 no tuvimos nuestro mejor d a y casi tenemos un traspi s
3365186 ja dei rike har da godt tenar lite og leve flott
3365187 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3365188 really its an unlighted area and were still under investigation but for some reason the pickup truck went left of center and struck the semi truck head on
3365189 hopefully youre so satisfied from the cookies that youre not going to want to go and eat anything else until your sensible dinner
3365190 if you ate a few chips ahoy or a few mrs fields and you didnt go overboard and then you ate a reasonable dinner and kept your calories under control technically its very similar to the cookie diets
3365191 however the cookie diets are either fortified with a little bit of fiber or protein or some vitamins and minerals to keep you full and add a little extra nutrition
3365192 better to eat real food much better to eat real food
3365193 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
3365194 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
3365195 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
3365196 kids today have been given everything they want and dont have to work for it they have no respect for authority
3365197 theyll make remarks right to the face of the mall cops i get to the point where i want to do something
3365198 but the police say we cant that we just have to stand there
3365199 the older people just dont see obama in these glowing terms
3365200 for older voters a lot of the reservations really have to do with this experience factor while younger voters see in obama something much closer to themselves
3365201 kids want to think for themselves they dont care what mom and dad say
3365202 this was a republican stronghold but its changing very quickly because its mom and dad youre republican so i aint ever going to be one of them
3365203 an awful lot of my friends didnt come back or didnt come back in the best mental condition i felt that id let them down
3365204 its kind of a tried and true american versus an unknown
3365205 there was never a lot of discussion about the issues we work on and he wasnt working with older communities to get out their vote
3365206 hes pretty much unknown on these issues as a result and has a lot of work to do
3365207 i like change i know a lot of people fear it but how do you move on in an organization or business without it
3365208 when it comes to constitutional law it doesnt matter how i morally think
3365209 if were all protected whether i like it or not is irrelevant
3365210 when i grew up you were a republican or democrat and neither shall be the other now not everything needs to be liberal or conservative youve got an opportunity to actually sit back and think
3365211 i mean come on if youre going to nitpick everyone who wants to be president youre going to run out of everyone and then youll have to come to me
3365212 love spent 11 days in the hospital suffered swelling of his intestinal tract and continues to have difficulties moving
3365213 in the decades of the 1980s there was a very rapid reduction in poverty
3365214 the decade of the nineties and the beginning of the two thousands the last 15 years has been a little slower but theres still been a perceptible decline
3365215 we are not including people who do not have access to running water sanitation schooling health and education they may well not have any of these things yet still not be considered poor because they earn enough to have the minimum calorie requirement
3365216 this is the tragedy of indian policy the government is sitting there paying its teachers and they dont turn up to school
3365217 what is happening is that as the country prospers the willingness of educated and skilled people to stay in the villages is going down
3365218 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
3365219 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
3365220 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
3365221 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
3365222 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
3365223 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
3365224 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
3365225 perfuming the garbage has helped residents are complaining less this will continue till we find a long term solution
3365226 acting white but if obama has been raised by a white grandmother and white grandparents is he acting or are his actions authentic

3365259 beliau menyapa kami siap dengan senyuman lagi tetapi apabila tuduhan ini dibuat ke atas bos anwar kami amat terkejut

3365306 spammers are moving en masse to the web and distributing malware on a scale not seen before criminals are not bothering to set up their own sites they are infecting legitimate sites with malicious code we can no longer rely on traditional url filtering lists because the safe sites may no longer warrant that trust the use of webmail accounts to send spam makes ip reputation or message header inspection less effective because the spam is generated using gmail yahoo and hotmail so the messages will appear to come from legitimate sources in our view the use of botnets to launch mass website attacks is the most concerning issue to arise so far in 2008
3365307 we are now in the situation where spam accounts for almost 90 percent of all email and increasingly contains links to infected sites

3365366 toni kroos hat zuletzt im pokalspiel gegen rot wei erfurt am vergangenen sonntag sein potenzial gezeigt und ich bin berzeugt davon dass er unserer mannschaft weiterhelfen kann f r seine pers nliche entwicklung ist die nominierung zur u 21 eine neue erfahrung von der er sicher profitieren wird
3365367 ich habe nach der sommerpause bis auf die verletzung unseres torh ters manuel neuer nur positive r ckmeldungen bekommen das zeigt dass die jungs auch in der saisonvorbereitung gut gearbeitet haben ich hoffe dass die mannschaft an die leistungen ankn pfen kann die sie in der vergangenen saison gezeigt hat
3365368 moldawien hat einen kleinen vorteil weil sie bereits mitten in der saison sind aber wir haben bereits im hinspiel gezeigt dass wir die bessere mannschaft sind und wollen die partie ohne wenn und aber gewinnen

3365371 eine intensive betreuung und intensive schulungen gew hrleisten die schnelle integration unserer mitarbeiter das ist auch bei branchenfremden die ausreichend talent und motivation mitbringen kein problem
3365372 the demand for mini notebooks will be driven by several factors by their small form factor and small screen their light weight their price their ease of use and their basic but sufficient pc functionality
3365373 mini notebooks are likely to attract a variety of users with different usage scenarios content consumption internet browsing e mail instant messaging im keeping in touch with friends and family storing and sharing pictures and so on potential users are likely to include both first time buyers seeking a low cost introductory pc as well as experienced users seeking a low cost second or third pc for themselves or a relative
3365374 mini notebooks create opportunities to reach some new pc buyers and expand within existing buyers across all regions
3365375 considering the majority of mini notebooks will be sold to consumers pc vendors will need to pay increasing attention to the design and ease of use of mini notebooks these will be two crucial factors in this segment
3365376 for consumer mini notebooks to succeed they need to be positioned differently than standard notebooks and pc vendors will need to decide if the existing channels to market are appropriate and possibly look for new channels such as telecom gadget shops and so on
3365377 pc vendors will have to convince retailers to take on those products as they are still emerging products and potentially present some risk from an inventory point of view
3365378 unsere experten kommen zum kunden ins gesch ft und nehmen die vorhandene lichttechnik genau unter die lupe in der regel kommen bei dieser berpr fung deutliche einspar m glichkeiten zum vorschein
3365379 durch unsere leistungsstarke batwing lichttechnik mit speziellen reflektoren ben tigen wir zum beispiel oft 40 50 weniger leuchten als blich um im verkaufsraum ein insgesamt besseres lichtergebnis zu erzielen das bedeutet sowohl niedrigere investitionskosten als auch geringere strom und wartungskosten siehe rechenbeispiel sowie eine deutlich reduzierte w rmebelastung durch die verkaufsf rdernde inszenierung der waren steigt in der regel auch der umsatz
3365380 angesichts der heutigen belastungen der autofahrer und der zus tzlichen b rde hoher kraftstoffpreise ist eine pkw maut das falsche instrument und kommt auch noch zur unzeit der vorschlag sollte dahin verschwinden wo er herkommt im sommerloch
3365381 mobilit t ist ein grundpfeiler unserer gesellschaft der durch eine pkw maut ber geb hr besch digt w rde
3365382 gro e skepsis ist auch angebracht wenn man sich wie die bauindustrie von der pkw maut eine verst rkung der ffentlichen stra enbauinvestitionen verspricht
3365383 es besteht die gefahr dass die belastung steigt und die investitionsl cke bleibt
3365384 wir werden weiter auf die bauindustrie zugehen und gerne gemeinsam in den parlamentsberatungen zum bundeshaushalt 2009 f r mehr infrastrukturinvestitionen eintreten
3365385 auf diese weise kann die redaktion schwerpunkte in der berichterstattung setzen
3365386 ein besonderes highlight mit gro em romantik faktor und ideal als liebesnest ist die dreist ckige
3365387 als partner der gamearea m chten wir den gemeinsamen auftritt auf der gc nutzen um noch einmal gezielt auf diesen preis hinzuweisen den wir gemeinsam mit der europ ischen kommission ausgelobt haben
3365388 die geplanten neuregelungen verunsichern eine junge und sensible branche und schaden auch direkt den interessen der anbieter
3365389 eine sinnvolle abgrenzung von telemediendiensten und rundfunk muss ber weitere qualitative kriterien und nicht nur ber die anzahl der potentiellen nutzer erfolgen sonst ist die existenz der branche massiv gef hrdet was in letzter konsequenz zu einem verlust an inl ndischen anbietern bzw einem abwandern der bereits vorhandenen anbieter aus deutschland f hren d rfte dies w re untragbar
3365390 das w rde auch dazu f hren dass die landesmedienanstalten im falle einer trennscharfen abgrenzung ihre medienkompetenz im digitalen zeitalter unter beweis stellen k nnten
3365391 standard mais les ch vres les lamas et les lapins produisent galement de la laine les caract ristiques principales de la laine sont sa propri t isolante et absorbante dhumidit cest donc une excellente
3365392 das ist wie ein finale der ausgang k nnte f r den verlauf der saison entscheidend sein
3365393 der einzug in die gruppenphase ist nicht nur sportlich wichtig sondern auch wirtschaftlich
3365394 atl tico hat eine gute mannschaft aber es k nnte f r uns ein vorteil sein dass wir in der vorbereitung etwas weiter sind als die spanier wir wollen uns eine gute ausgangsbasis f r das r ckspiel in zwei wochen schaffen
3365395 die chancen stehen 50 zu 50 wir wollen in gelsenkirchen unser tor sauber halten und versuchen selbst einen treffer zu landen

3365399 i would really enjoy a wheelbarrow full of ham right now eh who am i kidding when wouldnt i enjoy a wheelbarrow full of ham
3365400 i agree with one exception crts i replaced two home crts with two nice lcd screens and wasnt sure what to do with them assuming no one would want them i looked up recycling them which turned out to be pretty expensive
3365401 3 bins of random computer stuff come and get it you have to take all of it if you want any of it
3365402 the low hanging fruit may be gone but theres still a lot out there
3365403 back in the day who would have thought that a random group of letters dot com would be worth something
3365404 well to that company that has the corresponding name its worth a lot
3365405 dot com is always going to be the blue chip standard
3365406 all of this new property is going to be wasteland because its not going to be recognizable to the public
3365407 ich glaube dass ich mehr gewollt habe als ich kann
3365408 ich glaube da ist ber die 100 meter erst einmal nicht so viel zu erwarten
3365409 ich war dabei es war der aufregendste tag meines lebens
3365410 wir ahnten dass solche daten im umlauf sind jetzt haben wir es schwarz auf wei
3365411 uns sind die ersten f lle bekannt in denen von konten der betroffenen verbraucher abgebucht wurde obwohl diese unmissverst ndlich jegliche teilnahme an einem gl cksspiel ablehnten
3365412 beide haben uns ihre kooperation zugesichert um schnellstm gliche kl rung zu erreichen
3365413 so now well get to hear from the apple fanboys about how apple is protecting us from the apple
3365414 to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint
3365415 is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint
3365416 just to line up the airlift sorties wouldve taken weeks
3365417 the rainfall received recently has laid the foundation for continuing inflows at a good level if average or above average winter and spring rains continue
3365418 my idea was basically to recognise the fact that ballarat is a vibrant city that functions for many hours of the day and and to encourage people to come into the city by freeing up car parking
3365419 typically after normal business hours this will create 115 new parking spaces in the centre of town and that has got to be a positive for the community
3365420 were very disappointed in the offer as its nowhere near what we are seeking
3365421 obviously it just reflects on how poorly the government and the management of ambulance victoria view paramedics as professionals
3365422 no industrial action has been decided on at this stage
3365423 there is still a long way to go with negotiations
3365424 most of the mental illness tends to be chronic and we know with good effective treatment people can improve quickly
3365425 we have around 1400 patients on our case management list which are jointly managed with the general practitioners out there
3365426 every patient has a gp and we will now work with them rather than just caring for them and suddenly discharging them
3365427 by far the most common form of mental illness in society is depression and anxiety disorders the patients this will have the most impact on are those with severe disorders
3365428 the government will benefit from the surplus value available cash from high oil revenues to support the ration card items and import of fuel and electricity sector and the development of air transport fleet according to the statement regarding the use of the supplementary budget
3365429 there is the potential problem of low oil prices and the government have a duty to protect people by providing financial reserve otherwise the country will collapse and peoples lives
3365430 the government announced the recruitment of the supplementary budget in the establishment of strategic projects as called for parliamentary blocs and iraqi forces improving government performance in providing services of direct prejudice the lives amp 1575
3365431 i advised cr hayes that i had concluded my enquiries into the matter and i would at this time be taking no further action in regards to the service request
3365432 a case for the breach of s 76b 1 b of the local government act is not supported by the evidence provided
3365433 there has been a number of sightings by people across the state from bendigo to ballarat and narre warren but so far they have been discounted
3365434 see thats done that was easy why dont you throw in a quick load of laundry
3365435 our goal is to make business ownership a real possibility for ambitious young canadians under this program where no previous baking or retail experience is required a young individual could be leasing their own business within a year and potentially move on to become a bakery owner within 1 2 years
3365436 by helping to fund these applicants into their own business the cobs bread manage to own program makes franchising a viable first career option for young canadians
3365437 we have trialled the program and our first candidate kevin ker is set to take ownership after leasing our lakshore location for the past 21 months
3365438 cobs has given me the opportunity to fulfil my dreams of owning and operating my own business through this leasing program they have made it possible for the right people to make their dreams a reality
3365439 theres risk as is with any business venture but the most important thing is that all the tools you need to succeed are available and its up to you whether you make them work for you

3365489 whats critical here is that early weight loss may provide lasting benefits for risk factor control that in turn can reduce diabetes related complications and mortality
3365490 weve known for a long time that weight loss is an important component in diabetes treatment and prevention now it appears there may be a critical window of opportunity following diagnosis in which some lasting gains can be achieved if people are willing to take immediate steps toward lifestyle changes
3365491 these findings suggest that even in the face of weight regain losing weight can have long lasting benefits in type 2 diabetes
3365492 the therapeutic advantage achieved through weight loss is exceedingly important given the close connection between glycemic and blood pressure control and cardiovascular outcomes
3365493 we dont know if the initial weight loss increases the bodys sensitivity to insulin or if the sustained lifestyle changes are the reason for the long term health benefits what we do know is that losing weight reduces the risk factors that often lead to heart disease blindness nerve and kidney damage amputations and death

3365500 we gave ourselves 60 days to get the final agreement and terms completed however the excitement from all parties gave this initiative top priority the opportunity to partner with wi technology and participate in this project is absolutely a huge opportunity for the freedom financial holdings shareholders we believe the technical and economic viability of this breakthrough technology has the potential to significantly increase and change the production of heavy oil resources
3365501 the first oil production leases contain approximately 1500 acres with oil reserves that are estimated to be over 800 million usd after first witnessing the conversion process of old hard asphalt separate back into its original form with sand and gravel at the bottom and pure oil at the top we at freedom financial holdings and wi technology believe this proprietary heavy oil conversion technology could potentially change part of the processes involved with domestic oil production
3365502 final negotiations with the drilling company should be completed over the next few days once this agreement is consummated we hope to be producing oil within 60 90 days the most exciting point concerning this whole initiative is that we know where the oil is this is not exploration but production samples of oil from the first lease have been evaluated and first indications show that we have very good grade of oil the missouri department of natural resources estimates missouri has between 35 billion and 42 billion in heavy oil reserves

3365507 morale is not what the people are making it out to be
3365508 were talking about strikes from helicopter gunships which could not have mistaken these places for anything else
3365509 if their plan to totally destroy georgian statehood fails at this stage they want to make us bleed economically
3365510 the international community has to make the russians leave georgia
3365511 theres an element of disorganisation in the military that may become a factor as the
3365512 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities
3365513 the caricatures of people with intellectual disabilities are you know almost hateful and we want this to be the beginning of the end we want this to be the end of hollywood treating this population as the butt of jokes
3365514 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3365515 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3365516 thats the great thing you know if i want to protest something because it offends me thats my right as an american and its also any artists right to say and do whatever they want to do
3365517 i dont think well go for the one size fits all approach
3365518 well assess individual partners country by country in terms of their capability as well as the value that they offer us
3365519 ma qual il senso di tutto ci il motivo per cui ognuno di noi si alza la mattina per cui io mi alzo la mattina giorno dopo giorno e affronto tutto ci che mi accade nessuno riuscito mai a trovarmi questa risposta a risolvere questo mio quesito perch alla fine non esiste nulla di universale tutto si basa sul principio di relativit sul fatto che una singola cosa per me pu essere nulla ma per unaltra persona pu essere tanto in tutto il tempo in cui ho vissuto ho capito una cosa che si vive una volta sola che quello che ti scappa oggi difficilmente torner uguale unaltra volta si vero la vita una ruota tutto ti si ripresenta davanti prima o poi ma sempre in modo diverso e quando si ripresenta perde quel qualcosa di speciale che lo ha reso unico la prima volta diventando simile ad un film gi visto perci una delle cose che mi ripropongo da questa estate di cogliere le occasioni al volo e di mettere i miei sentimenti e i miei pensieri davanti a tutto anche se a volte pur di non rovinare tutto preferisco tacere e implodere tutto ci che vorrei dire trackbacks the trackback url for this entry is
3365520 almost a quarter of firms are reporting poor or very poor conditions
3365521 this is an economy that has slowed very very rapidly it is weakening much faster than expected in the face of tighter financial conditions further falls in equity markets high oil prices and very weak confidence levels it is not a very nice survey
3365522 now was a good time to buy a major household item
3365523 we havent been immune from the global credit crunch which started with the subprime mortgage issue in the united states and has gone on to infect global credit markets and obviously we havent been immune from the impact of increased oil prices either
3365524 were also seeing a slowing as a consequence of eight interest rate increases in the last three years
3365525 the key to value in telstras 2008 financial year result is the sustainability of top line growth rates through the 2009 financial year and 2010 financial year
3365526 if the top line can be sustained at well above 3 per annum as network transformation is achieved the build up in earnings will be greater than the current market consensus

3365532 photovoltaics have their place but it doesnt make commercial sense on a utility scale
3365533 ours is a much lower cost per megawatt with thermal solar and because thermal solar allows heat storage we can produce power into the evening and in the early morning
3365534 the desert type conditions almost no cloud cover and a large amount of solar radiation make a strong case for solar in australia
3365535 if youd have spoken to me in 2007 id have said the rate was more like a third of customers
3365536 clearly customers like the certainty of subscription pricing and weve also seen that when they take caps they aggressively shift their traffic off fixed networks dominated by telstra onto the mobile so thats a good thing
3365537 its definitely not the case that we see the margin as less important than market share but it is the case that when we accelerate acquisition activity or launch a major new product because we expense that upfront it does have the impact of reducing our margins
3365538 everybody has to understand that if you have such a start with 700 retailers in such a short period you cannot deal on a personal basis with the problem of everybody in the first period particularly the first days when people had a lot of questions and they didnt remember how to deal with the terminals
3365539 now that we know where all the problems are the network has been stabilised and there are no major issues
3365540 very much more comfortable with the technology fix they have put in place

3365544 cost was the driving factor in our decision to deploy the ibm system z9 ec
3365545 weve cut our operating costs significantly while ensuring that the z9 has sufficient processor capability to support winn dixie for years to come the use of the mainframe is integral to our success as we continue getting better all the time

3365549 as i recall the stove worked great everclear certainly is flammable
3365550 its certainly hard not to be spooked by the currency
3365551 this reflects a very big change in expectations in domestic money markets from the rba
3365552 and commodity prices moving lower that removes a relative support for the aussie
3365553 economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
3365554 both the kiwi and the aussie are probably most vulnerable especially against the correlation that they exhibit against the commodity side
3365555 those are probably going to see the more pronounced retracement
3365556 bhp and rio have both been quite strong its mostly that move in bhp and rio thats pushed the market into positive territory today
3365557 bhp has also come off quite a lot in the last few days so a few people are trying to pick the bottom on it

3365589 our new zealand businesses have been affected throughout the period by the economic slowdown with a number of our major advertisers cutting back advertising plans
3365590 when i heard about it i felt really hurt inside
3365591 i cannot believe a writer could write something like that its the not the way that we want to be portrayed we have feelings we dont like the word retard we are people were just like any other people out there we want to be ourselves and not be discriminated against
3365592 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive
3365593 no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3365594 if you want to pick on people as the old playground saying goes pick on people your own size
3365595 this population struggles too much with the basics to have to struggle against hollywood were sending a message that this hate speech is no longer acceptable
3365596 its hard to tell that the world we live in is either a reality or a dream
3365597 wilfully blind as to the truth or falsity of the imputations
3365598 our response has been quite positive were pleased that the accc has identified the use of restrictive covenants and other restrictive mechanisms as broadly anti competitive
3365599 they effectively limit the ability of a new entrant going into that sector but we would have liked to see the accc go a little bit further and eliminate the use of restrictive covenants in future developments
3365600 further to that they need to unwind existing restrictive covenants all theyve done is merely identified that lease deals can be anti competitive
3365601 if the use of restrictive covenants is phased out safeway will no longer be able to draw up a contract with the new owner to impede new entrants into the centre
3365602 anywhere there are 15 000 to 20 000 people an aldi store can operate

3365607 we supply bikes to most other international cycling teams as well as the australian team so we have athletes regularly visiting our facility to see our designs and to have their individual bikes customised
3365608 this will make it more convenient for them than our current heidelberg heights location we also wanted a location in a prestige estate
3365609 there is definitely pressure on at the moment for organisations to be looking at where their call centres are located and we are seeing a number of particularly larger operators reassessing their options
3365610 when we looked at the limited availability of space where we were accessibility issues and the costs east bentleigh made the most sense
3365611 were also now looking at taking an additional 2600 square metres which just wouldnt be possible in the city
3365612 the suburbs offer appreciably lower rentals in some cases and higher car parking ratios which can significantly add to a more positive bottom line
3365613 the predominant driver is to secure a more stable workforce with such low levels of unemployment making competition for labour in cbd areas intense and the industry itself growing by at least 10 per annum

3365622 the goal of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been ensured
3365623 whenever hotbeds of resistance and other aggressive plans emerge make the decision and eliminate them
3365624 if you receive the order to cease fire this would not mean that we would stop all operations including reconnaissance operations
3365625 it means an end to military action if there is no retaliation there is always a gap between rhetoric and reality the way i read it is that military hostilities are about to end traditionally we will see a few skirmishes but frontal attacks and positioning will end
3365626 the relationship between forces on both sides will be decided later on
3365627 this takes time it will not be done overnight luckily there were no hostilities in that area
3365628 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intent in georgia and the region
3365629 these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize relations with the united states and europe
3365630 if the united states and europe dont stop russia i think this is the end of what we thought of as the post soviet era
3365631 the russians feel they have been treated like dirt by the world for the last 20 years now theyre back
3365632 the combination is that the overall means with which weve dealt with the russians over the last two years have painted them into a corner so that its difficult for them not to see us as hostile
3365633 not exactly the greatest hand of cards to have to play

3365641 saya amat tidak bersetuju kerana telah terbukti seperti apa yang berlaku di universiti universiti lain setiap kaum tertentu hanya akan bergaul dengan kaum mereka sendiri
3365642 ini bukan persaingan yang sihat keadaan ini lebih bahaya jika wujudnya perasaan mementingkan kaum sendiri walaupun belajar dalam satu institusi
3365643 i absolutely disagree with this view because it is proven that each race will only mingle among themselves as it is happening in other campuses
3365644 this is not healthy competition this situation is more dangerous if there sentiments of racial self preservation exists even when studying within the same institution

3365648 great article and a reflection on how the software testing function would be influenced in an agile environment
3365649 you only need to unit test tdd testing is sufficient

3365658 she was so down to earth and was really changed by yoga
3365659 even though we had different struggles i thought if it worked for liz it could work for me
3365660 i was always very judgmental bou yoga and thought there was a real woo woo aspect to it i never thought it would ever become my primary workout so i was so surprised by how hard it was
3365661 i didnt have the upper body and core strength to do many of the poses
3365662 i had frustrating moments but i still felt good when i left and kept coming back
3365663 even at my least fit i never felt like i didnt belong there
3365664 the first class warms me and then i can play during the second class because im more open
3365665 i dont just have one bicep bump i have definition in my arms

3365670 we track what you said you were going to do to what you actually did and that has never happened before
3365671 you got to the hotel and went for a 125 room instead of the 100 room you booked in the past companies would have no way of knowing that
3365672 corporate data managers are seeking data independent of their travel agency
3365673 if people are educated they want to make the right choices
3365674 they do push back particularly sales people who say i generate x millions of dollars and you squeeze me for 75
3365675 they are testing to see if a trip is really necessary
3365676 were finding lots of companies are lowering that to 1
3365677 we give them tools to take it as far as they want to go
3365678 i dont need a million people to see my things just the right people who have hopefully good taste to buy my things
3365679 youre always taking a risk with sellers from sites like these
3365680 unless there are guarantees or some seller ratings like the ones ebay has accumulated over time there will always be some bad experiences
3365681 they lost focus all their money comes from sellers buyers are what drive the market but you need quality and protection for the sellers or else they dont even want to deal with the buyers
3365682 dont touch them but dont run them off they keep the rabbits out
3365683 yes my husband really does love me and wants me to live with him

3365685 hey the guy who did the voice of chef on south park died the day after one of the black guys from oceans eleven passed away
3365686 weve always ended up doing everything together whether it was deploying or spending time at home
3365687 when we were younger times were tough with the moving but me and nick stuck together through it all
3365688 during my childhood i didnt always have friends but i always had my brother
3365689 when my brother was talking about the marine corps i knew it was time for me to join
3365690 i always knew i was going to join i just didnt know when
3365691 i always wanted to be able to say im a marine
3365692 when my brother and i fought in pugil sticks it was not like fighting just any person because it was a grudge match
3365693 i remember during the pft nick gave me a high five during the run portion
3365694 it made me laugh and i got my butt chewed by my drill instructor for smiling
3365695 how brothers are back at home are a lot different than how we are
3365696 we constantly are there to look out for each other and because of this deployment it has made us really close
3365697 the dennard brothers display a great positive energy for the other marines in the company and are highly respected amongst their peers
3365698 as brothers they are always looking out for their other brothers their fellow marines and sailors
3365699 it was like he and i were going on a little trip to a far away place
3365700 the only difference is that im worried that something might happen to him if we receive contact
3365701 maureen murphy was a true public servant and a pioneer within the illinois republican party
3365702 maureens contributions to the conservative movement in illinois will have lasting impact
3365703 as an elected official county party chairman and state central committeeman maureen served not only the republican party but the people of this state with the utmost honor and distinction
3365704 our thoughts and prayers are with maureens family during this difficult time
3365705 she didnt wear her faith on her sleeve but believe me she practiced her faith in her life
3365706 the congressman got up and said to the audience maureen murphy is like a pink flamingo in the barnyard of cook county politics
3365707 and she was colorful and she did stand out and she did try to do her very best given the circumstances of what the political landscape was
3365708 i took it as a compliment why wouldnt you want to be compared to john wayne he was always on the side of good vs evil in the eternal struggle hed ride into town and be on the side of truth and justice and fair play he was a great american hero and i dont care how they try to pitch that im taking that as a compliment my wife saw that picture and she loved it
3365709 i dare say that in this cultural climate if chicago were able to spend as much as new trier spends on each student black males still would underperform what is needed is not so much a change in the school funding formula but a fundamental change in attitudes about family and society
3365710 she was always very clear about her interests and her fight for the sanctity of life that was a big issue for her
3365711 a pink flamingo in the barnyard of cook county politics
3365712 i think what i would emphasize most about her is that no matter where she stood you knew exactly where she stood
3365713 she let you know exactly how she felt about a topic
3365714 if its more than a handful we dont need them
3365715 a sense of intrisic superiority is always the english vice

3365720 icleis partnership with the carbon disclosure project underscores how crucial standards quantification methods and voluntary reporting are to local climate action
3365721 this project provides the opportunity for transparency and is essential in the emerging national and global policy dialogue as the priorities of local governments to achieve swift and deep reductions are identified and advanced by local government leaders
3365722 the city of new york joins the worlds leading corporations in providing a complete accurate accounting of its carbon emissions the strategies it is employing to mitigate those emissions and the results of its efforts through the carbon disclosure project and iclei this partnership between the worlds major corporations and increasingly its cities highlights the importance of the cooperative action needed to successfully counter climate change working together and with the best data we can manage this problem and leave our children and grandchildren a healthier and more sustainable planet

3365855 people were probably saying to themselves here is memphis the buckle on the bible belt and isaac hayes is coming out onstage dressed as black moses
3365856 if you notice that album opened out with flaps kind of like a crucifix that was seen as pretty heavy for those times and that was the mystique about him wearing those chains
3365857 the first few shows i did with him he didnt wear the chains
3365858 but then he started wearing them and i think it represented to him the coming freedom of the black man
3365859 his music represented an identity of what it meant to be black
3365860 it was exciting in a kind of strength of course it all coincided with the civil rights movement and for a musician his was a different image coming out there onstage with no shirt and those chains man it was a whole other world
3365861 i remember we had been on the road and he came offstage and people were howling and grabbing for him and one of the musicians said man you are the black moses people will follow you anywhere it was really radical
3365862 so everything you hear on his albums he had hummed to himself first
3365863 the chance of somebody in essence absconding is by and large eliminated because they have their money invested in their freedom as well

3365962 the suggestion that the mersey venture is a separate and differently governed undertaking resembles the untenable proposition that a train rather than a hotel is separate from its railway undertaking
3365963 that mersey seafoods also is subject to federal legislation governing navigation and shipping is the double aspect doctrine at work under our system of cooperative federalism
3365964 but would instead amount to a direct and major intrusion

3366086 the mindless slaughter is being conducted by a russian military that seeks to reassert itself not only in the former soviet union but also to extend its reach throughout what used to be the former soviet union in an attempt to fold back into the russian empire those countries that have broken away from it most notably georgia
3366087 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3366088 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia

3366100 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
3366101 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
3366102 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface

3366104 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails

3366126 these scams are despicable and prey on the trust of honest hardworking people

3366128 we have reported these incidents to the police and we hope that sheffielders will soon see the back of these predators
3366129 this is sickening to treat other human beings like that is simply appalling i hope action is taken to remove this sign immediately we must never see anything like this again
3366130 landlords should play a positive role in helping migrants feel welcome in the area instead of playing into the hands of racists

3366143 i think people might think this is something to do with criminality damian gordon was not known to the police
3366144 he was a married man with a young son there is no evidence to suggest this was a targeted attack
3366145 we believe there may have been precursor incidents that led to some bad feeling between people from bradford and people from manchester

3366331 one thousand years after the formidable war machines of the user cultures devoured entire civilizations and rewrote planetary geography earth is in the grip of a perpetual dark age scientific endeavor is strongly discouraged while remnant technology is locked away hidden by a church determined to prevent a new armageddon this is the world to which benzamir michael mahmood must return a descendant of the tribes who fled the planet during those ages old wars he comes in pursuit of enemies from the far reaches of space the technology he brings is wondrous beyond the imaginings of those he will meet but can its potency match that of the churchs most closely guarded treasure for centuries it has lain dormant but it is about to be unearthed and the powers that will be unleashed may be beyond anyones capacity to control even a man as extraordinary as benzamir

3366343 although pelecanos pays homage to his crime writing roots uncoiling a lethal subplot involving no good charles baker that spurs a fitting if bloody resolution it is the central questions of how men can have purpose and atone for their sins that makes the turnaround an indelible read
3366344 fuller never met him bryant but re creating him has dragged her into a world of greed and power and destruction and beauty more instructive on the unsettled state of the democratic party and its current leftward drift we are witnessing a tectonic shift from the centrism that president clinton embraced and imposed on his restive followers to a more open throated liberalism now referred to as progressivism that is angry and spoiling for a fight
3366345 in my line of work you gotta keep repeating things over and over and over
3366346 theyre only as daring as their target demographic allows them to be

3366348 yes you should have an attorney but as you begin thinking about merging you should also talk to people such as an investment consultant and someone from a business valuation firm
3366349 they can help you answer questions such as should i do pure merger or a statutory merger should i just sell my assets should i close up shop and transfer my people
3366350 can be a meeting of the minds to determine whether there is enough agreement between parties to go forward
3366351 in a service firm the biggest assets are the employees the talent

3366355 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3366356 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3366357 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3366358 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3366359 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3366360 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3366361 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3366362 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3366363 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3366364 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator

3366601 gta is banned mainly because of its obscene content under the criminal law article 287 that prohibits reproduction distribution or possession of such material

3366615 ook het halen van de halve finale is een topprestatie op zich hij heeft zich goed in de kijker gespeeld is heel ver gekomen
3366616 ze zag mij niet eens staan alsof ze niet wist waar ze was zo stond ze ook op de mat ik heb haar na drie partijen alsnog op de rails moeten zetten hoe door knalhard ruzie te maken
3366617 zij heeft een harde aanpak nodig straks bij willeboordse moet ik dat anders aanpakken dan moet ik lief zijn
3366618 daar sta ik nog steeds achter maar vandaag moest ik omschakelen de situatie vroeg er om ongelooflijk eigenlijk
3366619 ze zei ik ben er helemaal klaar mee echt dat zei ze terwijl ze nog een medaille kon winnen ga dan nu maar weg heb ik geantwoord hier hebben we geen vier jaar lang keihard voor gewerkt
3366620 ze begon te huilen daarna heb ik weer de ware elisabeth gezien degene die een unieke prestatie leverde door vijf wereldbekerwedstrijden op rij te winnen daarvoor waren er alleen maar twijfels twijfels twijfels ze is z xa2 goed maar ja dat mentale
3366621 ik was gewoon op van de zenuwen hier ik blokkeerde volledig ik dacht dat ik van dat probleem af was dat bleek niet zo de olympische spelen hebben me overdonderd het was even te veel voor me
3366622 maar de tijd om door schade en schande wijs te worden heb ik eigenlijk niet ik ben 29 misschien ben ik er over vier jaar wel helemaal niet meer bij krijg ik nooit weer een kans als deze toch heb ik nog brons omdat ik net op tijd weer in mezelf ben gaan geloven of ik er blij mee ben natuurlijk
3366623 ik had een complete off day niet n fatsoenlijke actie heb ik kunnen maken vooraf klopte alles het had allemaal gekund het is het de vorm van de dag verhaal
3366624 zoals hij er nu instaat is het ajax en anders niets
3366625 het is belachelijk dat je een bijna 34 jarige speler met zon staat van dienst met jongens van zestien en zeventien jaar wilt laten meetrainen
3366626 ik weet dat kenneth niet gehaald is door marco van basten maar dat geeft hem nog niet het recht om zo met een speler om te gaan er is gekozen voor de jeugd terwijl kenneth juist terug naar amsterdam moest komen om de jonge spelers bij de hand te nemen volgens mij is dat vorig seizoen goed gegaan
3366627 maar wij zien geen andere uitweg de communicatie met ajax ligt sinds maandag stil destijds is er ook niet over een oplossing gesproken de enige boodschap was kenneth moet naar de beloften
3366628 weet ik niet er zijn raardere dingen in het voetbal gebeurd van basten zei dat hij vond dat kenneth hard gewerkt had en een goede houding tentoonspreidde in de voorbereiding dat maakt het allemaal zo onwerkelijk
3366629 stopt hij misschien zoals hij er nu in staat is het ajax en anders niets
3366630 van basten zei dat hij vond dat kenneth hard gewerkt had en een goede houding tentoonspreidde in de voorbereiding dat maakt het allemaal zo onwerkelijk
3366631 met stan op pad was je veilig hij regelde alles en je hoefde je nooit zorgen te maken dat hij het ultieme shot zou missen
3366632 van marrakech tot belgrado van een item over speeltoestellen tot live verslag van een terreuraanslag op de kwaliteit van stan en roel kan ik altijd rekenen
3366633 camerawerk voor een nieuwsrubriek is heel divers en soms enorm inspannend een goeie samenwerking met een cameraman is dan essentieel met roel van hees en stan storimans heb je als verslaggever goud in huis beiden zijn hartstochtelijke nieuwsdieren en uitstekende technici die letterlijk op alle fronten ingezet kunnen worden

3366636 pedestrian exposure to high levels of these air toxics within parking garages is of concern because of the proximity and intensity of the vehicle activity within the semi closed environment
3366637 the less than one to one reduction in pollution is likely due to surrounding traffic influences
3366638 we didnt specifically measure air pollution coming from traffic outside the garage
3366639 our goal was to give some perspective to the concentrations recorded in the garage and we wanted some basis of comparison
3366640 we were pleasantly surprised to see that the garage concentrations were in fact lower than what was measured at a nearby outdoor site
3366641 ours is the first study that has described the concentration of vehicle related hazardous air pollutants in a parking garage
3366642 we wanted to know what those concentrations were and how they varied within and between days to better understand the health risk
3366643 our conclusion is that theyre comparable to or even less than concentrations seen in other urban settings

3366648 i leave you hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in your bosoms until there shall no longer be a doubt that all men are created free and equal

3366669 just as i was telling the marina harbourmaster that volunteer was to be taken out of the water and that her berth would then be available for visitors i was handed an envelope containing cheques totalling 1 000 from two members of the haven ports yacht club at levington
3366670 they were aware of our plight and said they valued our services
3366671 we are not out of the woods by any means but these donations do mean that we can carry out patrols throughout august and perhaps into september only pending no unforeseen circumstances
3366672 yet again it has been the public that has come to our rescue and we are sincerely grateful
3366673 we dont consider ourselves owners of the vehicles we believe we are merely custodians

3366678 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3366679 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3366680 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized

3366682 we left when the shelling started we dont have food
3366683 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3366684 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3366685 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3366686 several national pharmacy organizations are recommending that residency training be required for some entry level pharmacy positions especially in hospitals
3366687 that would extend the duration of mandated education and experience for at least some pharmacists as well as put pressure on colleges and others to develop more residencies to meet the needs of our graduates

3366739 this belgian prodigy seems a cut above with sumptuous strings and smoky soul all tailored into genuinely original funky delight
3366740 learnalilgivinanlovin is a stomping soul record that mighty stevie wonder would have been proud of
3366741 soulful falsetto tops accordion heavy tangos clattering snares fluttering strings and dubby textures laced with squelchy synths
3366742 the best cutnpaste album since the avalanches like drawing blood is a meticulously crafted mishmash that sounds thoroughly modern
3366743 makes mark ronson s musical tastes seem rather narrow minded royksopp but with added soul this is an amazing orchestral offering
3366744 considering he is essentially a one man band and a supreme drummer at that you can only marvel at the scale of the soundscapes

3366772 severe diabetes mellitus is more likely to be associated with chronic hyperglycemia high blood glucose which in turn increases the likelihood of cerebral microvascular disease and may contribute to neuronal damage brain atrophy and cognitive impairment
3366773 our findings suggest that diabetes mellitus duration and severity as measured by type of treatment and the presence of diabetes mellitus complications may be important in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment in subjects with diabetes mellitus
3366774 in contrast late onset of diabetes mellitus short duration of diabetes mellitus or well controlled diabetes mellitus may have a lesser effect

3366919 the framers of the constitution knew human nature as well as we do they had lived in dangerous days they knew the suffocating influence of orthodoxy and standardized thought they weighed the compulsions for restrained speech and thought against the abuses of liberty they chose liberty
3366920 those who won our independence believed liberty to be the secret of happiness and courage to be the secret of liberty

3366922 what a man thinks is of no concern to government

3366943 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3366944 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3366945 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3366946 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3366947 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3366948 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3366949 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3366950 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3366951 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3366952 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3366953 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud

3366994 no no he has done something wrong and hurtful and he needs to make amends before he is worthy to receive the flow
3366995 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3366996 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3366997 we left when the shelling started we dont have food
3366998 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3366999 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3367008 the inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of the
3367009 the whole question of stalingrad and the fate of 6th army is so clouded with guilt in the german mind that in holding an inquiry twenty years later it is almost impossible to find any witness who has told the whole truth

3367016 my sister is so weak that her weight is only 30 kg it shows the inhuman brutality of a so called civilised nation
3367017 central investigative agency cia of us could find a single clue against my sister but she is deprived of basic human rights as she is not allowed to get the medicines
3367018 us prides itself for its judicial system i pray she may get a fair trial
3367019 my appeal is to pakistani people my brothers and sisters that your sister has been abducted tortured and humiliated for continuous five years
3367020 it is a picture of a severely dehydrated sick person almost as if on the deathbed any one with any feelings their hearts would go out for the agony this woman has endured
3367021 i have no guns nothing just tears and cries but i am confident that 16 crore people of pakistan are hearing me and they would never leave their sister and children alone
3367022 they are both going to play a lot and they are both going to play together at times because when we put them out there together it opens up a whole new challenge for defenses trying to stop us
3367023 with both of us out there you have no idea who is getting the ball and that makes us both more dangerous
3367024 that is what made west virginia so good they had pat white steve slaton and noel devine back there thats a lot to deal with hopefully people will say the same thing about us
3367025 leaving the harbour and the historic part of the city the ekaterininskaya street brings us back to the black sea hostel not to be mistaken for the black sea hotel whose questionable reputation is the stuff of local gossip the hostel is located close to the centre and lovely administered by and english speaking staff hostel guests receive a free english map of odessa as well as advice and directions to any sights one wishes to visit most guests here are not usually tourists from abroad but are either there for russian language courses or temporary work contracts over a glass of rich red odessa wine in the evening you soon hear tales of the varied often colourful backgrounds of those with whom one is sharing a room
3367026 the harbour city of odessa is probably one of the ukraines most enigmatic a visit is an unforgettable experience particularly in spring or summer when the beautifully arranged gardens and broad alleys stretch out before you however a word of caution such a trip is only for those who know some russian or have a healthy sense of adventure
3367027 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country

3367031 sony ericsson wanted to make sure our first hsdpa handset was the perfect combination of style and function as all know hsdpa is a big leap forward in the speed of mobile functionality but as always sony ericsson does not deliver technology for its own sake
3367032 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
3367033 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
3367034 boicottermo il film prende in giro e offende le persone diversamente abili ha detto il portavoce di una delle 22 associazioni sul piede di guerra vogliamo invitare la gente a non andare al cinema

3367036 wacky packages just formed an island of subversive underground culture in the surrounding sea of junk
3367037 i didnt know they were that memorable until about 12 years ago with the internet
3367038 before that i didnt think of it as any more important than the other series

3367044 i have heard of nakorex and their good stage performance but what i witnessed was a far cry from their reputation
3367045 the little said about the performance of 5five the better i asked myself whether this was the same duo who won two awards recently when you compare their show at the 48th republic concert to what they did here the pageantry in fact they are a disgrace to some of us who voted for them during the ghana music awards if these are our future stars then god help us
3367046 it seems the event organizers did not learn from their previous mistakes
3367047 they keep bringing kkd as the mc and he talks too much making the programme boring
3367048 the key in any good clean energy relationship is having local knowledge and combining that with technical expertise and efficiency thats exactly the type of partnership clear skies and aspen energy are bringing to the greek solar industry
3367049 theres no question greece is one of the most progressive solar minded countries today their current environment of available grants and favorable feed in tariffs presented a great opportunity for clear skies we fully expect that this 150kw contract will be the first of many great solar energy opportunities in the region
3367050 our newsmaker breakfast series will provide a fresh perspective from this year
3367051 we wanted to find a way to help colorado residents participate in convention week festivities our breakfast conversations will present an exciting roster of speakers to our readers
3367052 these events will offer politicians and the public access to unique and powerful audiences the local community via the host newspapers political enthusiasts via politico and the world via yahoo news
3367053 just about every election minnesota is at or near the top for voter turnout in the nation so here we have the opportunity to add to the political discussion for a savvy civically engaged populace

3367055 biasanya saya sholat di masjid imam husein dan sholat isya di sini tapi lihatlah bagaimana ketentuan allah berlaku allah menakdirkan sayalah orang pertama yang harus menyambut anda setelah kepulangan anda ke kairo ungkapkanlah kepadaku wahai faqih apakah anda menyalahkanku atas apa yang telah terjadi
3367056 aku tahu anda tidak bermaksud buruk terhadapku tapi perbedaan pandangan diantara kita tetap ada sejak hari ini dalam kasus apapun aku tidak mempersalahkan dan membebaskan dari kesalahan siapapun yang berbuat buruk terhadapku
3367057 mudah mudahan allah akan menaikkan kamu wahai nabi ke tempat yang terpuji q
3367058 ya allah yang maha hidup dan tak pernah mati yang menghidupkan dan mematikan ampuni dosa dosa ibunda saya fatimah binti asad lapangkan kubur yang akan dimasukinya dengan syafaatku utusanmu dan para nabi sebelumku karena engkaulah yang maha pengasih dan maha pengampun
3367059 adakah mukmin sejati yang meyakini ada yang dapat memberikan pahala atas kebaikan dan menghukum atas perbuatan buruk selain dari allah
3367060 saya kenal betul dengan segala inklusifitas dan gambaran mengenai sekolah fiqih yang didirikan oleh syaikh anda imam ahmad dan saya tahu betapa luasnya teori fiqih serta mendalamnya
3367061 apa pendapat anda mengenai khalifah sayyidina ali bin abi thalib
3367062 tidak semua sufi mengenakan jubah dan pakaian kasar lihatlah apa yang saya kenakan apakah anda tidak setuju dengan penampilan saya
3367063 tetapi anda adalah ulama syariat dan mengajar di al ahzar
3367064 argumentasi tersebut justru ditujukan untuk anda karena saat imam al qusyairi melihat pengikutnya melenceng dari jalan allah ia segera mengambil langkah untuk membenahi mereka sementara apa yang dilakukan para syaikh sufi sekarang saya meminta para sufi untuk mengikuti jalur sunnah dari para leluhur kami salafi yang saleh dan terkemuka para sahabat yang zuhud generasi sebelum mereka dan generasi sesudahnya yang mengikuti langkah mereka siapapun yang menempuh jalan ini saya berikan penghargaan setinggi tingginya dan menempatkan sebagai imam agama namun bagi mereka yang melakukan pembaruan yang tidak berdasar dan menyisipkan gagasan kemusyrikan seperti filososf yunani dan pengikut budha atau yang beranggapan bahwa manusia menempati allah hulul atau menyatu dengannya ittihad atau teori yang menyatakan bahwa seluruh penampakan adalah satu adanya kesatuan wujud wahdatul wujud ataupun hal hal lain yang diperintahkan syaikh anda semuanya jelas perilaku ateis dan kafir
3367065 ibn arabi adalah salah seorang ulama terhebat yang mengenyam pendidikan di dawud al zahiri seperti ibn hazm al andalusi seorang yang pahamnya selaras dengan metodologi anda tentang hukum islam wahai penganut hanbali tetapi meskipun ibn arabi seorabg zahiri menerjemahkan hukum islam secara lahiriah metode yang ia terapkan untuk memahami hakekat adalah dengan menelisik apa yang tersembunyi mencari makna spiritual thariq al bathin guna mensucikan bathin thathhir al bathin meskipun demikian tidak seluruh pengikut mengartikan sama sama apa apa yang tersembunyi agara anda tidak keliru atau lupa ulangilah bacaan anda mengenai ibn arabi dengan pemahaman baru akan simbol simbol dan gagasannya anda akan menemukannya sangat mirip dengan al qusyairi ia telah menempuh jalan tasawuf di bawah payung al quran dan sunnah sama seperti hujjatul islam al ghazali yang mengusung perdebatan mengenai perbedaan mendasar mengenai iman dan isu isu ibadah namun menilai usaha ini kurang menguntungkan dan berfaedah ia mengajak orang untuk memahami bahwa mencintai allah adalah cara yang patut ditempuh seorang hamba allah berdasarkan keyakinan apakah anda setuju wahai faqih atau anda lebih suka melihat perselisihan di antara para ulama imam malik ra telah mengingatkan mengenai perselisihan semacam ini dan memberikan nasehat setiap kali seseorang berdebat mengenai iman maka kepercayaannya akan berkurang
3367066 ibadah bagaikan mihrab bagi hati yakni aspek bathin bukan lahirnya
3367067 anda telah berbicara dengan baik andaikan saja gurumu seperti yang anda katakan maka ia sangat jauh dari kafir tapi menurutku apa yang telah ia ucapkan tidak mendukung pandangan yang telah anda kemukakan
3367068 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians

3367082 the quest for knowledge used to begin with grand theories now it begins with massive amounts of data
3367083 scientists have always relied on hypotheses and experimentation now in the era of massive data theres a better way
3367084 the scientific method is built around testable hypotheses this is the way science has worked for hundreds of years
3367085 faced with massive data this approach to science hypothesize model test is becoming obsolete

3367116 good email delivered to the inbox is welcomed but people hate spam and are equally frustrated when valid email is unnecessarily blocked however the picture has improved significantly in recent years today all the parties involved in email marketing recognise that they have to collaborate if the industry is to combat spam and ensure that the medium achieves its potential
3367117 a growing spirit of openness has seen isps become richer sources of information which in turn enables email marketers to respond by using the sophisticated capabilities of lyris listmanager 10 everyone wins because less spam is delivered and more legitimate messages get in to the inbox
3367118 ensuring that email messages make it to the inbox continues to be a critical challenge for email marketers particularly as spam volumes increase and internet service providers isps change their guidelines for which messages get delivered

3367125 local councils can find out the number and cause of avoidable contacts which is the first step to reducing them
3367126 the fact that simple transactions are increasingly satisfied by consumer self service internet and systems means person to person contacts tend to be more complex and take longer
3367127 reducing avoidable contact gives more capacity to handle unavoidable contacts more effectively and reduce overall workload
3367128 speech technology has reached a critical turning point where it is now fundamentally changing the way that we interact with the world around us

3367130 one of the major benefits of logbook loans is that you can often get access to cash on the same day that you submit your application
3367131 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
3367132 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks
3367133 bent only played at the end of last season but tottenham paid a lot of money to sign him and two years ago he was a very important player at charlton
3367134 baldini told me he played very well so we will have to wait and see

3367145 virtual bridges offers excellent responsive support which is also key in choosing a solution that must support over 10000 users
3367146 we now have a central mechanism we can use as a tool to look for triggers in the genome that work with hox and sens to regulate the formation of neurons and blood cells
3367147 this allows us to identify other key genes downstream of hox and sens determine their role in development based on what happens with cell fate decisions and look for the causes of birth defects and disease
3367148 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3367149 island environments offer an excellent test of competing hypotheses they typically have a similar megafauna and climate to neighbouring continental landmasses but human arrival was often delayed
3367150 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction
3367151 the skeletal remains provide key evidence of tasmanias final megafauna in the dim if not too distant past
3367152 we have a long history of enhancing call centre productivity with sophisticated contact centre applications direct integration with mitel is a further demonstration of the openness of our technology and our ongoing commitment to offering the most flexible options to our customers
3367153 with advanced advertising cable operators can provide a unique value proposition to advertisers who want to target the subscribers who best fit their product or service this is accomplished by unlocking the many sources of audience qualification information that exist or are emerging across cable operators systems and subscriber bases as well the ability cable operators have to identify specific viewing preferences and habits and to track viewing behaviour on a granular basis is critical to the success of advanced advertising
3367154 based on their internet advertising experience advertisers are also increasingly looking for tv advertising to support a more rapid automated campaign creation and execution process along with accurate reporting of the campaign results
3367155 gizmo is a relatively young company and the capability of inspirationcompact to expand and adapt to our growth surpassed all our expectations the solution let us pinpoint the areas needed for agent training and even helped managers outside of our contact center identify areas they could improve
3367156 the results of the survey so far show that although most companies understand the importance of having business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place there seems to be a knowledge gap when it comes to understanding the technologies that are currently available to deliver reliable and fast recovery in the event of a system failure these days it is not enough to blindly trust that backups are being completed properly businesses and the regulatory environment in which we all exist demand fast and reliable recovery time objectives for it systems such is the pace at which a modern company transacts business these days that those who are without their it for any great length of time are losing serious money customers are also becoming a lot more aware of the information that companies hold and are getting less and less forgiving about delivery disruption let alone the thought of their sensitive data being transported in a an unencrypted and readable format
3367157 this change in causes of data loss can possibly be attributed to improvements in software and hardware resiliency in the last two years which has reduced the number of hardware and software failures affecting computers changing the way these threats need to be addressed in business continuity and disaster recovery plans moving forward
3367158 is that the founders of these disciplines envisioned the same thing that you have this broad dispersal of all of the organisms that each happened to be studying and that they would colonize the surface of the earth depending on whether the environment was suitable for them
3367159 before now all biologists could do was look at the biodiversity of microbes that could be cultured in a petri dish we now know that the vast majority of microbial life cannot be kept in captivity now we have the ability to grab dna from the environment and try to characterize different species or taxonomic groups using genetic material allowing our field to blast off
3367160 we are just beginning to scratch the surface of what these patterns look like
3367161 was that the diversity gradient more correlated with temperature than primary productivity
3367162 sackler colloquium in the light of evolution biodiversity and extinction
3367163 from our study we saw that environmental selection seemed to play a larger role and was more important for microbes than the plants
3367164 you have to be careful about the conclusions that you make
3367165 so on a 2 000 meter elevation gradient for example the spatial scale relative to the body size of a plant is much much larger when you consider what the universe looks like to a microbe
3367166 diversity patterns on mountainsides have been studied mostly on plants and animals for hundreds of years
3367167 yet microbes are the most diverse set of organisms on earth and they are really important for how ecosystems work our study establishes the first elevation gradient pattern for microbes we found that yes microbes do have a diversity pattern that is similar to what has been studied for plants and animals but the pattern is different than what you see for plants in the rockies and there is much to be done to understand why microbes might have a different biodiversity pattern
3367168 anyone who is starting up a distribution company or any other company for that matter will know what its like to get things going and constantly have issues that threaten the survival of the business my vision of being a distributor with bite was being seriously undermined by a lack of appropriate it infrastructure
3367169 realising that i had to set up an it system that was both scalable and robust enough to cope with massive data needs with a limited budget gave me a big headache
3367170 a supplier needed to convince me that they could deliver what they promised i knew intercept were on my wavelength when they explained how the system was setup when it could be delivered and the simple cost per user per month pricing model i liked the aggressive approach to getting things done thats something i can relate to

3367175 universities that want to lure the best students will need to invest heavily to implement an it infrastructure that will meet the expectations of this group and maintain their competitive edge in the race for securing higher student intake to meet this 150m price tag it is inevitable that universities will be looking to the government uk plc and possibly students to put their hands in their pockets
3367176 this survey is deliberately targeted at an age group that is being asked to choose its education and career path whilst this science statistic should worry uk plc and the governments of today and tomorrow the message is clear if we can educate them on the correlation between science and the gadgets they cant live without and spark their interest before choosing their gcse options we can influence the future of british industry

3367196 the vision we have is to great veterans that are just coming back from iraq or from conflict areas

3367198 we dont just veg out and say prayers all day
3367199 the idea of the center is not only to help sailors and marines in distress but to promote good stress management and promote psychological health so it starts when people come into boot camp and lasts all of the way until they graduate from war college
3367200 the idea is that we get past the concept of just dealing with things when they are in crisis and hopefully promote a system of addressing stress and addressing our ability to cope with it so we rarely get into a crisis mode
3367201 combat stress of course is the stress that occurs when you are in combat the extreme set of circumstances when your life is in danger and when you have to make life and death decisions quickly and when you are under extreme pressure

3367303 the accidental mayor came into office making all kinds of wild promises about fiscal responsibility but hes now proposing an incredibly irresponsible budget that threatens public safety
3367304 how can the accidental mayor honestly claim that public safety is his top priority when he proposes a budget that will lead to renewed jail overcrowding and force the early release of criminals
3367305 if this proposal is approved its only a matter of time before the federal courts once again seize control of the jail
3367306 whats the point of spending more money to put additional police officers on the streets when under the mayors plan the people they arrest will only have to be released back into our neighborhoods because of an underfunded jail and court system
3367307 this is nothing more than an attempt to force the privatization of the jail by handcuffing the sheriff and the court system i suspect all of the criminals in our community are applauding this budget it seems that the mayors only answer to solving problems is to outsource whether the jail or the mayors action center maybe he should consider privatizing the mayors office since he obviously isnt up to running the city on his own
3367308 the mayor campaigned on a promise of not cutting public safety funding but if the jail and the courts arent part of the public safety system what is what makes a neighborhood safer than keeping criminals in jail where they belong
3367309 this is a short sighted and dangerous plan for indianapolis
3367310 this is another example of having a mayor who would rather turn back the clock instead of moving our city forward
3367311 this is what happens when you elect someone who cant articulate a vision for our city other than chinatown and cricket
3367312 steve buyer has been in congress for sixteen years and hes trying to avoid facing the voters in public we dont need secrecy here we need public debates
3367313 buyer wants to negotiate changes to the format so he can avoid facing the voters
3367314 i trust the hendricks county farm bureau to set a fair and reasonable debate format i trust it will be open to the public i dont need to argue over format details ill be there
3367315 we should be having debates that are open to the voters open to the press and near enough that people dont have to drive for hours to attend thats the spirit of american democracy that i believe we should follow
3367316 steve buyer seems to think that hes entitled to this job and that he doesnt have to be bothered to meet the people to be held accountable for what he has or has not done and to share his vision for our district and our country i think thats not right i believe that politicians work for the people and not the other way around
3367317 its important that we go out and meet the voters they shouldnt have to travel to meet us its a matter of principle we arent entitled to this job we report to the citizens of this district and should be accountable to them
3367318 im receiving invitations to debate from people who want to know how their congressman is going to solve the problems facing our country were facing a lot of serious issues these days im meeting voters all the time who are worried about the price of oil the state our economy and housing and frustrated by the treatment of our veterans they deserve an honest and open format to hear the candidates respond to questions
3367319 when i served in iraq every camera in the world was pointed at abu ghraib and two things happened as a result practices at abu ghraib vastly improved but the dark activity which previously happened there went elsewhere techniques in other prison facilities included induced hypothermia smashing hands with hammers and all sorts of activities which clearly are within the bounds of torture by any reasonable humane standard
3367320 life in the spotlight must be grand but for the rest of us times are tough
3367321 obama voted to raise taxes on people making just 42 000 he promises more taxes on small business seniors your life savings your family
3367322 we sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm
3367323 a young black first term senator a man whose father was from kenya whose mother was from kansas and whose name sounds as if it might have come from the roster of guantanamo detainees has won the marathon of primaries and caucuses to become the presumptive presidential nominee of the democratic party to reach this point he had to do more than outduel the partys most powerful and resourceful political machine he also had to defy and ultimately defeat 389 years of history
3367324 go back to your locals now is the time to unite we cannot let any bias or racial thoughts get in the way if your members have any problem with racial bias tell them to get over it for all time but especially now for this election get over it we must put barack obama in the white house and if we dont we are in deep trouble
3367325 t he amazing thing isnt that there were instances of overt old style racism during the campaign its that there were so few the amazing thing is that so many americans have been willing to accept or indeed reject obama based on his qualifications and his ideas not on his race ill never forget visiting iowa in december and witnessing all white crowds file into high school gymnasiums to take the measure of a black man and ultimately decide that he was someone who expressed their hopes and dreams
3367326 it is not enough to be right but you have to be right in the right way
3367327 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3367328 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3367329 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3367330 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3367331 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3367332 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3367333 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3367348 this in another despicable example of the anti iraqi insurgency knowing no boundaries in its cruelty
3367349 to rig up a school with explosives in order to potentially kill school children sets another low for these criminals
3367350 the ops in northern iraq will continue to expand the gois capability to increase essential services and reconstruction to villages like tahwilla
3367351 i think the most important thing about the meeting is the tribal sheiks and the religious leaders who represent leaders of sadr city had an opportunity to meet and interface with key people from the goi
3367352 the meetings present a forum for people to first meet and to introduce one another
3367353 i would say that realistically probably most of the real work is done in side meetings or in less formal working group meetings after these formal meetings
3367354 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3367359 we regret that vandalism has caused further damage to the already fragmentary remains of the blue marble stone which was once the cover for the tomb of king james iii
3367360 earlier this year one of the pieces had been cracked and following an incident last sunday it has now been broken in two
3367361 the stone which used to be in the nave of the ruined abbey church has been kept on the ground floor of the bell tower for many years in order to keep it as safe as possible while still allowing visitors to see an interesting and significant piece of scottish history

3367363 were going to discuss our book understanding social action promoting human rights oup 2009 which is a collection of new essays by leading social scientists sharing insights from their discipline for the betterment of human rights scholarship and advocacy when we contracted for the book we envisioned a two part translation first between disciplines and second between scholarship and practice we hoped the books publication would mirror those phases by first collecting and editing the pieces in a volume and second creating a website to share the research insights with advocates and other practitioners for their uptake and feedback weve got a good sense of how the first phase will go assigning the chapters receiving them writing an introduction etc but were hoping to be a bit more experimental with the second phase we wondered if and how and why we might create a website to host the insights we culled from the various disciplines and then apply them to real world human rights problems the website is just an idea at this point but were looking for guidance as to how much interactivity the site should allow what audience we should aim for where it should be hosted who should run it and for how long etc over lunch well briefly describe the book project to date including the various mechanisms weve used to give coherence to the project despite the diversity of our authors academic disciplines and then open the floor to you for advice on the projects digital phase we are considering several options including a simple read only page a wiki and a mapping project depicting the field of human rights instruments exposing the gaps

3367376 we have the infrastructure in place to make this move and i believe it is an important step for us to take as we begin to execute the early phase of our strategic business plan to drive growth and market reach of our unparalleled non lethal protection devices to an increasing number of police military and civilians

3367380 you know what really grinds my gears when i cant find the droids im looking for
3367381 completely dedicated to the lord and therefore totally dedicated to man
3367382 on the other hand and this is even more important today the multiplicity of charisms and the fact that together they make up the church
3367383 if we truly believe in eternal life and if we believe that god helps us
3367384 have the courage to limit themselves and the clarity to set their priorities
3367385 the time a priest spends with the lord and therefore having time for prayer
3367386 to learn what is truly essential to learn where my presence is truly needed as a priest and where i cannot delegate to anybody and at the same time i should humbly accept that there are many things and moments that require my presence but that cannot be done because i recognize my own limitations i think that such humility will be understood by people
3367387 and with this there is something else i should understand how to delegate and call others to collaborate
3367388 a true community of brothers who should sustain and help one another
3367389 isolation in loneliness and sadness and therefore it is important we get together regularly
3367390 no priest is a priest all by himself we are a presbyterate and only in this communion with the bishop can each one carry out his service
3367391 when i was younger i was stricter i said the sacraments are the sacraments of the faith and therefore where there is no faith there is no praxis of faith and thus the sacrament cannot be conferred and i discussed this latter with my priests when i was archbishop of munich as time has gone on i have come to understand that we must follow always the example of the lord who was very open to those on the fringes of israel at that time as well he was a lord of mercy very open according to many official authorities with sinners embracing them and allowing himself to be welcomed at their dinners attracting them to communion with him
3367392 if we can perceive even a flicker of desire for communion in the church a desire also of these children who want to enter into communion with jesus i think it is fair to be more generous naturally of course one aspect of our catechesis should be to make it understood that communion first communion is not an ending event but rather demands a continual friendship with jesus a journey with jesus
3367393 in these sense naturally we should do everything possible in the context of the preparation of the sacraments in order to reach the parents as well and thus make them aware of the journey they are on with the children they should help their children to follow their own desire to enter into friendship with jesus
3367394 great joy and privilege of worshiping here in beijing china
3367395 that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion

3367398 confirms the right every california child has to a quality education and the right parents have to decide what is best for their children
3367399 recent statutes indicate that the legislature is aware that some parents in california homeschool their children by declaring their homes to be private schools
3367400 would undermine a practice that has been if not actively encouraged at least acknowledged and accepted by officials and the public for many years
3367401 the states compelling interest in educating all of its children
3367402 parents do not have an unfettered right to dictate the terms of their childrens education
3367403 i have never seen such an impressive array of people and organizations coming to the defense of homeschooling the team effort was remarkable
3367404 serving the nation by living our catholic beliefs in political life
3367405 the church claims no right to dominate the secular realm
3367406 as catholics we need to take a much tougher and more self critical look at ourselves as believers at the issues underlying todays erosion of catholic identity and at the wholesale assimilation absorption might be a better word of catholics by american culture
3367407 do not conform yourselves to this age but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that you may discern what is the will of god what is good acceptable and perfect
3367408 the catholic faith is much more than a set of principles we agree to but rather an entirely new way of life people must see that new life being lived they must see the joy that it brings they must see the union of the believer with jesus christ p 190
3367409 the teaching of vatican ii exists first and foremost in the council documents themselves no interpretation of the council has merit unless it proceeds organically from what the council actually said and then remains true to it
3367410 christ fully reveals man to himself and makes his supreme calling clear
3367411 we need to root the social dimension of our catholic faith and everything else we do in gods love which is the fuel for our mission of evangelization we cant offer catholic social action to the men and women of the world without at the same time offering them jesus christ
3367412 the catholic church is a web of relationships based on the most important relationship of all jesus christs gift of himself in the eucharist for our salvation none of us earns the gift of christs love none of us deserves the eucharist
3367413 what needs to be done by catholics today for their country

3367419 demand for video advertising is very high with a 90 percent sell out for the small amount of available inventory
3367420 that online video is a choice medium for marketers and they are increasingly talking about video advertising rather than tv or online display advertising there is untapped demand at higher priced cpms there are dollars searching for video inventory and just as importantly there is direct response a captive audience lean forward targeting and metrics that can support higher cpms than tv but advertisers just dont have enough opportunities to deploy video in online

3367427 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3367428 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3367429 claims about the powers of the unconscious are always appealing and seductive
3367430 at worst theyre outright dangerous our research suggests that unconscious thought is more susceptible to irrelevant factors such as how recently information has been seen rather than how important it is
3367431 by going through that process you get to the root of the problem
3367432 and this perhaps provides reasons that you can enter into some kind of decision analysis technique

3367458 although buying interest has picked up nicely in advance of wedding season some local buyers are now betting that they might be able to pick up even cheaper gold if they wait some more
3367459 golds failure to hold above 850 and the lack of bullish reaction by traditional safe haven assets such as gold and oil to the clash between russian and georgian forces suggest the need for cash to cover losses in other sectors will continue to outweigh geopolitical tensions in the short term

3367488 with the exception of new zealand every country we cover has begun raising policy rates and is expected to continue to do so for the rest of 2008
3367489 in recent weeks in recognition of at least the oil shock being more persistent most countries have allowed domestic fuel prices to increase even if partially

3367493 what i had seen really seen were lives lived with the intensity of art rife with metaphor raw distilled
3367494 the emotions of love and friendship youd assume would be missing or rotten in these communities existing even more so for their being sought amidst illegality fragmentation and betrayal
3367495 these were lives lived beyond ordinariness insisting on a personal story not exchangeable with any other
3367496 i was completely unaware of the scale of the aids epidemic in india before i took part in this project
3367497 i was both intellectually challenged and emotionally moved by what i saw and learned when an epidemic gains a human face and you actually meet people who are dying of this disease everything changes
3367498 we simply dont like to talk about it even to impart or receive essential life saving information
3367499 none of the doctors i met had initially been trained to face the disease what they were now was shaped by it and hiv had confronted each in a slightly different incarnation a rumour a makeshift pedagogy a death

3367505 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities

3367517 without as much information as we have today we were attempting to close the gap between shuttle retirement and the first flight of orion and ares 1 to the absolute minimum and so we were trying to push the project towards a september 2013 date internally
3367518 that was not a commitment in any sense because we knew we had not built into that any contingencies everything would have to go perfect to make that date and would probably have required some additional funding
3367519 now weve changed our planning date from september 2013 date to a september 2014 date
3367520 they took the entire matter out of context in my mind and i worked for the press tribune for four years

3367542 spammers are moving en masse to the web and distributing malware on a scale not seen before in our view the use of botnets to launch mass website attacks is the most concerning issue to arise so far in 2008 we are now in the situation where spam accounts for almost 90 percent of all email and increasingly contains links to infected sites

3367568 comecei a sentir dores durante o doutorado e passei a procurar alternativas que me dessem mais conforto a primeira tentativa foi simplesmente fixar um tubo de cola em bast o sobre o mouse e utiliz lo como um joystick que me garantiram uma empunhadura mais ergon mica

3367572 the addition of the datallegro team and its technology will take our data platform to the highest scale of data warehousing
3367573 it extends microsofts capabilities in the data warehousing space and provides microsoft a great opportunity to accelerate its data warehouse roadmap and leapfrog competitors it also reinforces microsofts leadership in business intelligence enabling companies of any size to use microsoft bi
3367574 it extends microsofts capabilities in the data warehousing space and provides microsoft a great opportunity to accelerate its data warehouse roadmap and leapfrog competitors
3367575 with this acquisition sql server will span data warehouses of all sizes from small to very large in addition it extends the significant investments microsoft has made into data warehouse scalability in sql server 2008 it also reinforces microsofts leadership in business intelligence enabling companies of any size to use microsoft bi
3367576 microsoft sql server is exceptionally well established in companies of all sectors and sizes its used as a transaction engine for many mission critical applications and as a data warehouse or datamart for bi applications performance management pm applications and analytics
3367577 but a reputation of limited scalability has been hard to shake
3367578 enterprise data warehousing has been a significant investment area for the upcoming release of sql server 2008 this acquisition only adds more options for customers and prospects with datallegro microsoft can push into a market segment where it had little penetration before and make this push with standard hardware configurations from dell bull cisco and emc
3367579 for microsoft bi in the broadest interpretation possible is a sharp tip of the spear
3367580 its a burning business issue for buyers around the globe with massive spending of 57 billion and growing planned for infrastructure tools analytics and planning applications content and presentation via the web and desktop it encompasses company specific users and innumerable participants in the extended value chain in short business intelligence meshes exceptionally well with microsofts ubiquitous software footprint today and is a catalyst to preserve and expand its presence throughout the enterprise
3367581 business intelligence meshes exceptionally well with microsofts ubiquitous software footprint today and is a catalyst to preserve and expand its presence throughout the enterprise
3367582 although we have some doubts as to whether a datallegro and microsoft combination will become the most scalable platform within the market what is not in dispute is that the company will provide a significant boost to microsoft in its bid to become a heavyweight player in enterprise data warehouse edw market
3367583 although microsoft has worked hard to improve its credentials in the enterprise market with sql server 2005 and latterly with sql server 2008 due for release before the end of the year it has never really been a serious threat in the upper end of the enterprise edw market where implementations run into the tens and hundreds of terabytes range
3367584 although microsoft is unlikely to have gained any significant market share through this acquisition it has got its hands on some important technology for improving the scalability and performance of its data platform although the majority of datallegros customers fall within the 25 100 terabyte range it did purport to have two customers with systems in excess of 250 terabytes these make impressive figures for microsoft which only has customers working in the 1 15 terabyte range and expects sql server 2008 to extend this into the 20 50 terabyte range

3367727 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3367728 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3367729 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3367730 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3367731 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3367732 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3367733 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3367734 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3367735 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3367736 the notes show tojo kept his died in the wool militarist mentality until the very end
3367737 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120 percent
3367738 we are now on a course for a humiliating peace or rather a humiliating surrender
3367739 being scared of enemy threats and easily throwing their hands up
3367740 frightened by the new type of bomb and terrified by the soviet unions entry into the war
3367741 many soldiers and the people cannot bring themselves to die until the goal is achieved
3367742 now that the diplomatic steps have been taken after the emperors judgment i have decided to refrain from making any comments about it though i have a separate view
3367743 moral responsibility for causing useless deaths even though they were meant to be sacrifice for a great cause
3367744 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3367745 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3367746 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3367747 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3367748 we have warned of the west bank government turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction
3367749 as we all know hamas is not only working in gaza
3367750 it works in the west bank too therefore i cannot act as if nothing has happened
3367751 i wish i had this training when i was there before
3367752 it helps take away the enemys advantage on us i know what i am looking for now
3367753 we give them the ability to think like the enemy
3367754 we can now see if anybody has been there and if we are being tracked
3367755 you are never going to see the world the same
3367756 we can read body language now and i know what i am looking for
3367757 however anecdotal evidence and after action reports from commanders in theater say that this training is saving lives the measure of success right now is when a marine returns from a patrol convoy or standing a post and is excited that he used the combat hunter training

3367773 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3367774 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3367775 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3367776 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3367777 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3367778 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
3367779 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall
3367780 said himself he thinks that it isnt necessarily the right moment given the olympic games for a meeting with the president

3367875 the philosophical framework we bring to government what we would describe as the reforming centre of australian politics recognising the power of markets but recognising equally the limitations of markets
3367876 as a matter of general principle we believe in using market mechanisms and incentives to design innovative approaches to long term challenges
3367877 we also believe in a compassionate society that endeavours to pick up those who have fallen down and help them back on their feet
3367878 that is why we explicitly reject hayeks view that society has no obligation to others who are unknown to us and hayeks preparedness to allow fundamental social institutions like the family to fend entirely for themselves against unrestrained market forces
3367879 that is why for example we have a different approach to industrial relations because we believe families need certain fundamental protections in the workplace

3367886 while biofuels will be responsible for a significant share of added demand for commodities in the coming years food will remain by far the primary consumer

3367899 this ground breaking discovery confirms what researchers and experts have believed for some time mitochondrial disease is not rare
3367900 we now know that 1 in 200 people carry the mutation for this horrible debilitating disease this discovery underscores the need for additional research funding to help better diagnose and treat affected individuals and to learn more about how mitochondrial dysfunction is connected to other diseases
3367901 the demonstration by dr chinnery and colleagues that at least one in 200 newborns harbor known pathogenic mitochondrial dna mutations indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction is a major underlying risk factor for human disease
3367902 this new observation augments the rapidly expanding body of evidence indicating that common mitochondrial dna lineages modulate the risk for developing a wide variety of diseases including diabetes cardiovascular disease parkinson disease alzheimer disease various cancers as well as longevity
3367903 dr chinnerys research raises many new questions none of which can be answered without additional dollars allocated for research into mitochondrial disease and dysfunction
3367904 this line of research holds great promise ultimately the investment we make may enable doctors and researchers to transform medicine benefiting not only those suffering from mitochondrial disease but the many millions of americans who suffer from the wide range of diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction

3367930 it was probably the best eight or nine points we have played against one of the best pairs in the world
3367931 it might have meant a tiny bit more being chinese in the first round in china
3367932 and the fact she beat us in the olymic final four years ago might have given us a little bit more incentive but hey its the and all that
3367933 a british rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3367934 the largest upward pressure in july came from food and non alcoholic beverages where prices rose this year but fell a year ago
3367935 within this division there were large upward effects from meat bread and cereals and vegetables
3367936 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3367937 the rise in to a series high of 4 4 percent in july was well above expectations

3367944 yet believers in man made global warming demand more and more money to combat climate change and still more drastic changes in our economic output and lifestyle the reason is that precisely that they are believers not scientists no amount of empirical evidence will overturn what has become not a scientific theory but a form of religion
3367945 it is important that the reasons why this is happening are identified and understood so that society may respond appropriately the psychological and social pressures on young people today must be clearly identified and programmes to equip young people to respond to those pressures should be introduced the resources must be provided by the state to complete this
3367946 the detail of the programme to do this is set out in the report reach out the national strategy for action on suicide prevention 2005 2014 resources must be in place so that the recommendations in this report are introduced and in accordance to the time scale set out in the document

3368037 to suggest that our nations most important wildlife law could be gutted after a mere 30 day written comment period is the height of arrogance and disrespect for wildlife science elected officials have been saying no to proposals like this for 35 years

3368047 the emotions of love and friendship youd assume would be missing or rotten in these communities existing even more so for their being sought amidst illegality fragmentation and betrayal
3368048 these were lives lived beyond ordinariness insisting on a personal story not exchangeable with any other
3368049 i was completely unaware of the scale of the aids epidemic in india before i took part in this project
3368050 i was both intellectually challenged and emotionally moved by what i saw and learned when an epidemic gains a human face and you actually meet people who are dying of this disease everything changes
3368051 we simply dont like to talk about it even to impart or receive essential life saving information
3368052 none of the doctors i met had initially been trained to face the disease what they were now was shaped by it and hiv had confronted each in a slightly different incarnation a rumour a makeshift pedagogy a death
3368053 whether it is violence addiction poverty or aids these miseries seem to take place in the state an invisible corner of india that seems to have received nothing from modernity except drugs guns and draconian laws

3368125 his leadership and participation were clear contributing factors to the overall functioning of s21 and demonstrated an intention that the staff of s21 carry out these crimes

3368146 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3368147 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3368148 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3368149 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3368150 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3368151 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around

3368158 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment

3368188 my first thought was that he had robbed a bank
3368189 there was over 71 000 dollars in that bag thats more than my husband earns in a year
3368190 i just got the e mail one day and i figured what the heck i put my name on it like the instructions said and i started sending it out
3368191 i get junk e mail all the time and really did not think it was going to work
3368192 about a week later i rode my bike down to the post office and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it there was also a yellow slip that said i had to go up to the post office counter
3368193 i went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me i had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because i could not carry it all
3368194 the money just kept coming in and i just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet barely had time for my homework
3368195 i didnt want the banks to get suspicious so i kept riding to different banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack i would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money and he was outside waiting for me one time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it but i just rode to the next bank down the street laughs
3368196 absolutely no laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions they are bound to make some mega bucks with only 25 out of pocket cost
3368197 thanks to this profitable opportunity i was approached many times before but each time i passed on it i am so glad i finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required to my astonishment i received a total of 610 470 00 in 21 weeks with money still coming in

3368201 you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life with no risk and just a little bit of effort you can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined follow the program exactly as instructed do not change it in any way it works exceedingly well as it is now remember to e mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in report 1 and moved others to 2 through 5 as instructed above one of the people you send this to may send out 100 000 or more e mails and your name will be on every one of them remember though the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach so my friend i have given you the ideas information materials and opportunity to become financially independent it is up to you now
3368202 my name is mitchell my wife jody and i live in chicago i am an accountant with a major u s
3368203 not being the gambling type it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan but conservative that i am i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that i wouldnt get enough orders to at least get my money back i was surprised when i found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders i made 319 210 00 in the first 12 weeks the nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live there simply isnt a better investment with a faster return and so big
3368204 i had received this program before i deleted it but later i wondered if i should have given it a try of course i had no idea who to contact to get another copy so i had to wait until i was e mailed again by someone else 11 months passed then it luckily came again i did not delete this one i made more than 490 000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks
3368205 it really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you i followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in my first month i made 20 560 00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was 362 840 00 life is beautiful thanx to the internet

3368233 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3368234 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my hope that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3368235 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3368236 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3368237 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3368238 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3368239 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3368240 thats totally out of the question we dont make enough from the antennas on that tower to make it worthwhile
3368241 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3368242 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3368243 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3368244 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3368245 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3368246 we took the decision to focus more on better margins

3368252 it was a thrill to coach the team and a challenge but it was a disappointing finish
3368253 we arent content with silver medals were only content with gold
3368254 ill say this its not easy to play on the home court of the team in the finals they were very good they were very tough they played like a team it was a disappointing finish to a very energizing time for our coaching staff and players everyone got better for the experience
3368255 a superb frontcourt player he has a very high iq its clear hes a great athlete his combination of a high iq and athleticism and his willingness to be taught and coached will make him a very special player
3368256 outstanding size 6 feet 5 i know hes a great shooter because i watched him make shots in practice all the time i think the extended fiba 3 point line created problems and threw him off just a little bit and i mean just a little bit when he gets accustomed to the college line hell make great contributions at oregon
3368257 he kind of reminded me a lot of russell westbrook an nba lottery pick in june he can play both on the ball and off the ball in the backcourt for ucla he has incredible quickness and is a very capable ballhandler he can make the 3 and beat people off the dribble he also is hungry to defend
3368258 he was our connector and i suspect will make very happy hell play any role do anything hes attentive to detail makes the extra pass does whatever is necessary thats why he was in our starting lineup every game
3368259 the leader of our team from the first day of tryouts until the final buzzer against argentina hes a floor general a real throwback point guard he wants to make his teammates better before doing anything else he has great ability to knock the 3 down or get to the rim and draw fouls hes a very capable scorer but puts a priority on getting his teammates involved

3368263 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3368264 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3368265 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3368266 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3368267 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3368268 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3368269 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3368270 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3368271 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3368272 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3368273 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3368274 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3368275 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3368276 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year

3368282 i am reassured after our talks that there will be more people going through the pavilions
3368283 we will be in contact with the sponsors and i hope they will be satisfied

3368285 the chinese fight when they are down and never give you anything so it was nice to turn the tables
3368286 weve waited four years for another chance we only came here for the gold
3368287 we won silver last time so we only want to win the gold
3368288 was driven by a massive 6 billion decline in the non petroleum deficit which more than offset the higher cost of imported oil
3368289 it should rebound over the next month or two thanks to the lagged impact of 140 a barrel oil but if oil continues its downward spiral then that will begin to have a strong downward impact on the deficit over the second half of the year
3368290 all things considered we suspect the deficit will continue to narrow albeit more gradually

3368292 now it looks like ive made a cryptic comment on your blog
3368293 the company is showing off a pair of reference designs showcasing its new snapdragon chipset a heap of silicon said to offer one of the best power to performance ratios in the mobile world
3368294 i thought it was going to be really bad but its actually alright
3368295 doesnt rock out as much as the rest of me
3368296 but this is a new team a new town a new league and a new challenge for me the jackalopes have the potential to be a very good team and the potential to make a run at a championship and that was important to me
3368297 talent leadership work ethic hes like a red wine whos getting better with age van drunen and i told him that the organization wants to win and odessa is a great situation for him and his family
3368298 one of the main reasons we originally moved into the x86 processor business was because we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear and we would need to have the capability to provide a complete platform that has indeed come to pass

3368301 he was flemings choice for bond so i sent him niven a copy of casino royale and the whole thing went from there
3368302 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3368303 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3368304 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3368305 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3368306 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3368307 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3368308 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3368309 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3368310 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3368311 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3368312 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3368313 who are open to doing something on the production side
3368314 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3368315 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3368316 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3368317 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3368318 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3368319 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3368320 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3368321 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3368322 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3368323 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3368324 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3368325 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3368326 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3368327 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3368328 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3368329 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3368330 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3368331 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3368332 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3368333 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3368334 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3368335 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3368336 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3368337 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3368338 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3368339 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3368340 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3368341 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3368342 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3368343 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3368344 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3368345 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3368346 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3368347 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3368348 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3368349 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3368350 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3368351 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3368352 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3368353 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3368354 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3368355 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3368356 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3368357 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3368358 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3368359 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3368360 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3368361 if we think about it as falafel we box ourselves into the middle eastern thing instead we have to think about it as a savory chickpea and herb fritter
3368362 so were not actually serving falafel were serving the anguished cry of falafel denied

3368374 a painstaking and thorough forensic examination is being carried out
3368375 house to house inquiries are continuing in the vicinity of the crime scene and the search of the scene is ongoing looking for possible weapons used in the attack
3368376 we are using chinese media outlets internet websites and community contacts to try and build up a lifestyle profile of the victims and identify the last sightings of the couple alive
3368377 they were two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get a good education
3368378 we have no known motive for this savage and brutal attack
3368379 they had both worked hard while at newcastle university and both had done extremely well graduating with good degrees
3368380 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy to recognise the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil
3368381 its her nanny she is a young moroccan woman who is qualified to look after children and works in a care centre
3368382 i am very pleased that this little girl has been identified and that she can be ruled out from her familys perspective
3368383 clearly for kate and gerry it is a disappointment but we have had many of these before and the search for madeleine will continue
3368384 with this big media attention people are stimulated and are looking with more attention on the subway and on airplanes

3368395 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3368396 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3368397 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3368398 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3368399 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3368400 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3368401 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3368402 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3368403 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3368404 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3368405 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3368406 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor

3368444 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation

3368474 the good news to the omahangu produ cers is that omahangu was declared a controlled product under the namibian agronomic board act in may this year and enjoys the same privilege as maize and wheat to the livestock farmers discussions are underway to come up with good marketing strategies which allow communal farmers to sell their livestock at good prices once this has been finalised then farming will not only be a toiling exercise but a rewarding activity as well
3368475 researchers are advocating that when there is not enough pasture for grazing farmers should de stock and re stock when the situation normalises this farming practice saves the farmers from losing their livestock and the same time prevents environmental degradation
3368476 this challenge needs a combined effort in order for us to overcome it the livestock need to be identified animal branding is one way of limiting stock theft farmers need to be vigilant and report any suspicious livestock movement to the nearest police station it is only when we are working together that we will be able to curb the stock theft problem
3368477 a lot of technologies have been generated by naro national agricultural research organisation and other research agencies but only 30 have been taken by farmers despite the efforts by naads national agricultural advisory services and local governments in reaching the farmers

3368488 it really does go to the heart of our patients confidence
3368489 when you look at these adverse events these are pretty gross errors
3368490 with something this horrific whether theyve operated on the wrong person or removed the wrong finger they shouldnt expect reimbursement
3368491 just because something defacto occurred on that list that doesnt mean that its defacto the fault of the provider
3368492 abo blood compatibility i dont have a problem with that
3368493 care providers are going to be so spooked about taking people with a red spot on their skin

3368495 you shouldnt expect to be set on fire for instance
3368496 in practice one real result is hospitals admitting these things occur and trying to keep them from happening
3368497 they were at fault and they wont convince me otherwise
3368498 as the social awareness of the country grew we adopted a new practice

3368541 being the competitor i am i always want to be on the field i never thought anything like this would happen to me when it did happen it was a heartbreaker and watching my team go in a slump a five game losing streak i kind of wanted to pull my hair out

3368557 we americans engage in foreign policy because we have to not because we want to and this is a healthy disposition it is that of a republic not an empire
3368558 the old dichotomy between realism and idealism has never really applied to the united states because we do not really accept that our national interest and our universal ideals are at odds for our nation it has always been a matter of perspective even when our interests and ideals come into tension in the short run we believe that in the long run they are indivisible
3368559 is the united states up to the challenge or as some fear and assert these days is the united states a nation in decline

3368564 they never give us anythng so it was fantastic to turn that on them for a change and come back from five points down in the third set
3368565 it was probably the best eight or nine points we have played against one of the best pairs in the world
3368566 it might have meant a tiny bit more being chinese in the first round in china
3368567 and the fact she beat us in the olymic final four years ago might have given us a little bit more incentive but hey its the olympics games and all that

3368581 wil what was it like to work with patrick stewart
3368582 the chinese government must launch an immediate and open investigation into these shootings
3368583 the roots of this tragedy lie in the decision of georgias separatist leaders in 1991 to abolish south ossetian autonomy
3368584 this turned out to be a time bomb for georgias territorial integrity
3368585 georgian president mikheil saakashvili was expecting unconditional support from the west and the west had given him reason to think he would have it

3368590 we regret that vandalism has caused further damage to the already fragmentary remains of the blue marble stone which was once the cover for the tomb of king james iii
3368591 earlier this year one of the pieces had been cracked and following an incident last sunday it has now been broken in two
3368592 the stone which used to be in the nave of the ruined abbey church has been kept on the ground floor of the bell tower for many years in order to keep it as safe as possible while still allowing visitors to see an interesting and significant piece of scottish history
3368593 the stone which was damaged is of historical value as it was the original tombstone of king james iii it was kept in the tower of the abbey
3368594 if the maker has a preference it might be the use of ritual bathing that combined bathing
3368595 while it is true that the people of the bible consumed a diet that contained liberal amounts of
3368596 im thirsty can you point me to the soda pop aisle
3368597 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3368598 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3368599 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3368600 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3368601 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3368602 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around
3368603 the era of choice the ability to choose and its transformation of contemporary life
3368604 follow me unless you have something more interesting going on
3368605 the only way were going to solve our problems in this country is if all of us come together
3368606 we are fellow americans and that shared distinction means more to me than any other association
3368607 theres no way were going back to the times of zachary taylor
3368608 its not is too much information bad its how do you manage within an environment that does provide all information and will continue to provide all information
3368609 with more choices out there if leaders want to bring issues to the attention of the public they have to bring it into our venues and speak it on our terms
3368610 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3368611 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3368612 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death
3368613 this country is an experiment and for it to have endured for this long it requires the involvement of citizens citizens making choices
3368614 where are those conversations we had like patrick henry on the steps

3368621 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3368622 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3368623 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3368624 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3368625 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3368626 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from taxes and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3368627 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3368628 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
3368629 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports
3368630 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3368631 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
3368632 the most important thing is the fact that in 36 of the states women are doing better than they were in 1997 and by better i mean as a comparison of the percentage of women in leadership posts compared with the percentage of women in the state
3368633 theres no question that americans are desperately looking for change and new ways to conduct business in this country they want a new direction they want to know that their government has not forgotten them and their lives we felt that the democratic convention was a great way to kick off the momentum for change
3368634 anything you can do to change and modernize the convention is positive one of the biggest challenges is putting up something television will cover and people will want to watch
3368635 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3368636 this has been a very instructive call talking to myself
3368637 wont a single tape of wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3368638 it would be handy to have a little cheat sheet that clearly stated refer these cases with this info
3368639 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3368640 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3368671 weve got such a bad right side tire compared to what we tested here in october
3368672 there isnt anybody i dont think who is happy with the tires weve got
3368673 i hate to say it but the best thing that goodyear does is to make that gold trophy at the end of the year a special award for the cup champion which stewart received in 2002 and 2005 that is the one thing that they always do right everything from that moment on until the end of the year its a crapshoot
3368674 today as hard as these tires seem i dont know if youll be able to wear them out
3368675 they did fall off really fast but we couldnt go out there and go real fast right out of the gate like we used to be able to do but i dont think wear is going to be an issue its just that they slide so much i dont think youll wear them out theyre so dang hard
3368676 the process that we go about to make the tire recommendations is sound and i have complete confidence in that process and the engineers that develop that process

3368691 in that regard these donations can be viewed as either short term loans or purchases into current business programs i dont want anybody who donates money now to get nothing out of it because i am the way i am if the business fails then ill just keep paying back each individual person until every 10 and 20 or more is paid back
3368692 my call for help was not arbitrary nor do i take the immense outpouring of support lightly the alternative to giving back product or cash is to create an investment group based on the total number of dollars raised and make each and every donor a member of that group the benefit then would be long term but it would exist that is something that i am very interested in looking at but cannot possibly put a percentage to until weve rounded out our drive if that is what the donors would like then that is the direction i wil go im not asking for a freebie hand out just help to get things sorted out
3368693 to what extent could improved rail travel serve as a substitute for business travel by air
3368694 where available as a sensible option rail travel is becoming more and more popular this is most obvious in relation to travel to paris or brussels where the eurostar is now the default option for the great majority of trips the availability of an expanded high speed rail network to points in the uk and continental europe that could genuinely compete in terms of time and service levels could substantially reduce demand for air travel to these destinations

3368699 time and again conservative and labour governments have discovered that when they give powers to private companies and those private companies screw up voters blame the government for giving the powers away rather than the companies for misusing them and it is much easier for governments to give powers away than to get them back

3368706 es ist v llig normal dass russland die interessen seiner b rger im inland und der russischsprachigen landsleute im ausland sch tzen will und es ist normal dass die internationale gemeinschaft die souver nit t sicherheit und territoriale integrit t georgiens sch tzen will

3368716 de jure haben sowohl abchasien als auch s dossetien weit mehr gr nde f r die anerkennung der unabh ngigkeit als es das kosovo hatte
3368717 die t rkei hat die von der weltgemeinschaft nicht anerkannte t rkische republik nordzypern russland wird zwei solche republiken haben
3368718 bedeuten dass sich diese beiden staaten de facto nie mehr in georgien eingliedern werden und dass das problem seiner territorialen integrit t nicht mehr existieren wird
3368719 wenn russland die unabh ngigkeit von abchasien und s dossetien anerkennt wird georgien der weg in die nato offen stehen und fremde truppen werden auf seinem territorium stationiert werden neben allem anderen wird georgien den terroristen separatisten und extremisten im nordkaukasus jede m gliche unterst tzung erweisen
3368720 die humanit re hilfe der stopp der humanit ren katastrophe die verdr ngung der georgischen truppen aus s dossetien all das f gte sich in den rahmen des v lkerrechts und der russischen verpflichtungen ein das kann russland jetzt kaum jemand vorwerfen
3368721 wenn aber russland auf das georgische territorium weiterhin angriffe aus bt und sich zur anerkennung von s dossetien und abchasien entschlie t k nnen wir die moralische berlegenheit verlieren die wir heute haben zumindest im postsowjetischen raum
3368722 mit seiner barbarischen aktion in s dossetien ruinierte er saakaschwili die zuverl ssigkeit seines landes er best tigte ein weiteres mal dass ossetische und abchasische v lker in georgien nicht in sicherheit leben k nnen

3368745 he has had every opportunity to turn this company around and tap the abilities of its first class employees but instead he has run it into the ground
3368746 these dismal numbers speak for themselves they are a reflection of his inability to lead his incompetence as a manager and his failure in virtually every category that can be measured we have tried every conceivable way to convince him to invest in and maximize the goodwill of his employees he has failed miserably

3368816 sein berraschender abschied ist ein gro er verlust f r uns und auch f r die bundesliga marcelinho war unser kapit n und hat auf und au erhalb des platzes viel f r den verein getan ohne marcelinho w ren wir nicht in den uefa cup gekommen er hat eine berragende saison gespielt und im jahr davor hatte er entscheidenden anteil am klassenerhalt
3368817 ich hatte den eindruck dass der spieler gerne wechseln m chte ich wollte ihm keine steine in den weg legen
3368818 ich hatte eine wundersch ne zeit der vfl war wie eine familie f r mich ich habe mich in deutschland sehr wohl gef hlt es war ein tolles erlebnis mit dem vfl die teilnahme am uefa cup zu erreichen ich w nsche dem klub alles gute
3368819 flamengo ist der gr te klub auf der welt das ist eine tolle herausforderung mit diesem verein titel zu holen gleichwohl beginnt f r mich und meine familie jetzt ein neuer lebensabschnitt
3368820 als fan als pilot und als teambesitzer mit piquet sports kann ich sagen dass in der gp2 die fahrer den unterschied ausmachen und nicht so sehr die autos
3368821 deswegen ist es meiner meinung nach keine berraschung dass viele der guten piloten die schon in der vergangenen saison stark unterwegs waren und mittlerweile einige zeit in der gp2 verbracht haben auch in diesem jahr wieder vorne mit dabei sind
3368822 die gp2 ist keine leichte angelegenheit vor allem nicht f r rookies du hast in den freien trainings und im qualifying einfach so wenig zeit abgesehen von giorgio pantano haben alvaro parente und romain grosjean wirklich beeindruckt ersterer hat seinen ersten gp2 erfolg eingefahren letzterer liegt mit pantano und bruno senna an der spitze der fahrerwertung
3368823 er zeigt ganz klar dass sein titel in der gp2 asienmeisterschaft keine eintagsfliege war in meiner deb tsaison hatte ich auch so meine probleme und war nicht vor meiner zweiten saison dazu in der lage konstant vorne mitzufahren eine der gr ten lektionen die ich in dieser zeit gelernt habe war im qualifying schon mit dem ersten satz reifen eine solide rundenzeit zu fahren dann bist du schon einmal auf der sicheren seite und kannst im zweiten anlauf wirklich die fetzen fliegen lassen
3368824 genau wie eine reihe neuer fahrer so hat auch das neue auto die dinge etwas durcheinander gebracht haupts chlich zu beginn des jahres
3368825 acht verschiedene sieger in nur neun rennen haben die konkurrenzdichte in dieser rennserie sehr sch n veranschaulicht jetzt hat sich der staub aber wieder etwas gelegt sodass man gewisse trends erkennen kann
3368826 nachdem sie im vergangenen jahr schon stark unterwegs waren reden art und isport auch in dieser saison wieder ein gewichtiges w rtchen mit und racing engineerung legt ebenfalls eine beeindruckende performance an den tag pantanos erfahrung hat dem team sehr geholfen ein schnelles und konstantes paket zu schn ren und ihm hat das im umkehrschluss dazu verholfen an die spitze der meisterschaft zu gelangen
3368827 weil ich meinem platz in der formel 1 nun so viel zeit widmen muss bin ich als teambesitzer nicht gerade sehr einnehmend das letzte was meine fahrer brauchen ist dass ich meinen eigen stress auf sie bertrage wenn ich aber freizeit habe vor allem abends dann gehe ich schon einmal in das gp2 paddock r ber die atmosph re dort ist einfach toll
3368828 ich kenne meine fahrer nicht sonderlich gut aber pastor maldonado und andreas zuber sind schnell sie liegen momentan an den positionen sechs und neun meiner meinung nach haben sie zu viele einfache fehler gemacht die sich aber mit mehr zeit im auto nach und nach abstellen lassen
3368829 die starts scheinen aber das gr te problem zu sein
3368830 das h ngt zu 90 prozent am fahrer und nicht am team deshalb m ssen wir ihnen auf diesem bereich vermutlich eine gr ere hilfestellung anbieten andi hat in letzter zeit einige tolle leistungen gezeigt aber w ren die jungs schon zu beginn des jahres ungef hr auf ihren platzierungen aus der qualifikation ins ziel gekommen dann w rden sie in der meisterschaft weiter vorne liegen
3368831 in der gp2 geht es ausschlie lich um junge fahrer und wir machen alle fehler gerade das macht doch den reiz dieser rennserie aus
3368832 ich habe den titel aufgrund von d mlichen fehlern verloren im moment ist einzig giorgio konstant unterwegs und das ist angesichts seiner erfahrung nun wirklich kein zufall toll ist bei dieser serie aber auch dass man sich nie sicher sein kann was als n chstes passieren wird

3368869 sleep apnea is a disease of the upper respiratory tract which doesnt have much to do with the lungs
3368870 weve all seen them pass by large neoplasms just to do their bronchoscopy
3368871 an ideal patient for upper airway surgery is someone who is young e g less than 40 is not very heavy body mass index less than 32 and has an apnea hypopnea index less than 40
3368872 if these patients are chosen for surgery their response rate is likely going to be much higher
3368873 this individual the apnea hypopnea index is now 14 and the o2 saturation events are 14 so this is a valid test i mean this is frankly all that you need to look at this is a 20 second no 10 second read this is the report it put out the guys got a ahi apnea hypopnea index of 14 and i think that that is sufficiently diagnostic
3368874 upper airway surgery should not be first line treatment for obstructive sleep apnea in adults

3368878 it is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed
3368879 for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him
3368880 what if god willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory

3368908 a repository of everything that has ever been thought or done
3368909 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3368910 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3368911 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3368912 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3368913 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3368914 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3368915 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3368916 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3368917 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3368918 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3368919 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future

3368932 amenace con recortar servicios esenciales como la sanidad cuando es dinero lo que necesita
3368933 en el caso de que el ministerio de econom a y hacienda adopte finalmente la decisi n de no entregar los anticipos a la comunidad deber a comunicar cu les son los hospitales o centros de salud que en su opini n no deben seguir prestando servicios
3368934 en lugar de asustar a los ciudadanos m s de lo que ya est n con esta paup rrima sanidad
3368935 esperemos que esto no sea mas que una amenaza para conseguir el dinero porque es evidente que la sanidad ni los servicios sociales necesitan ning n recorte en todo caso el recorte debe afectar a la privatizaci n para que se deje de mandar pacientes a la sanidad privada y deje de financiarla con dinero publico
3368936 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
3368937 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
3368938 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers

3368957 if mr massa is serious about disagreeing with speaker pelosi maybe he should put his money where his mouth is and return the 14 000 in campaign contributions hes received from pelosi
3368958 otherwise his statement is just deceptive hypocritical and highlights everything thats wrong with the democratic majority thats leading congress the bottom line is a vote for eric massa is a vote for speaker nancy pelosi and the do nothing drill nothing democratic led congress
3368959 only speaker nancy pelosi can set the agenda for the u s house of representatives and speaker pelosi has made it clear she wont allow a vote on a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling
3368960 its one of the limitations on his powers he cannot establish the agenda and the agenda is set by the majority party which brings it all right back to the speaker

3368980 building on the idea of product differentiation i want to underscore a second critical factor how people use media a lot of news organizations are still thinking about content and presentation in terms of medium and technology or worse in terms of tradition and comfort level when they should be thinking about content and presentation in terms of audiences in which i include people who read of print newspapers and people who read their news online or go there for more interactive experiences for an example of this look no farther than your spiffy new iphone and then check out what content your organization is providing to users there or on other mobile devices the news industrys capacity to deliver news information and interactivity to mobile seriously lags audience adoption and use
3368981 how much more powerful is that networked intelligence than a reporter with a phone a rolodex and the space between his or her ears
3368982 the problem is that the editorial workflow for most newsrooms doesnt include a process whereby journalists can collect source links as part of their research process and provide them as work product to be published on the web along with the article as jay rosen explains in this video understanding the value of links and how they connect content ideas and people is fundamental to understanding the value of the web and understanding the value of the web is the key to unlocking the new business models that journalism needs to survive and thrive in the digital age
3368983 gee willikers it must be obvious day at camp stupid
3368984 the reason lado did this is because he knew the enormous pr value that georgia would gain by going to the money people and analysts particularly since georgia is clearly the aggressor this time
3368985 lado is a former banker himself so he knew that by framing the conflict for the most influential bankers and analysts in new york that these power bankers would then write up reports and go on cnbc and argue lado gurgenidzes talking points it was brilliant and now youre starting to see the american media shift its coverage from calling it georgia invading ossetian territory to the new spin that its russian imperial aggression against tiny little georgia

3369006 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems
3369007 with an insecure compromised system even basic revenue controls to name one example become significantly challenging
3369008 strengthening of the market in the summer can occur even when the longer term market trend might be downward
3369009 theres a line between being responsible for rebuilding a country you helped destroy and being a chump and i think we crossed that line
3369010 the summer games youtube channel is the ideal first stop for fans because it provides a comprehensive view of whats going on in beijing
3369011 contributing media organizations have their fingers on the citys pulse and theyre sharing the action with a worldwide audience through one location on youtube
3369012 has radically expanded the definition of indecency beyond its original conception magnified the penalties for even minor ephemeral images or objectionable language and targeted respected television programs movies and even noncommercial documentaries
3369013 i thnk it is an incredible statement from fcc chairmen who have been some of the architects of the indecency policy and who are now saying that this is out of control
3369014 the enhanced indecency standard was created under mark fowler and here he is saying
3369015 talisman to ward off serious questions about the extreme subjectivity of the agencys determinations
3369016 it is time for the court to bring its views of the electronic media into alignment with contemporary technological and social reality
3369017 as former regulators we appreciate that the fcc is in an uncomfortable position buffeted by the turbulent passions of anxious parents and threats from excited congressmen
3369018 but that is precisely why the matter must be taken out of the agencys hands entirely
3369019 the brief filed by the former chairmen is disappointing especially given the disparity of the co signers
3369020 newt minow was the single greatest fcc advocate for the public interest and for children and mr fowler was perhaps the worst personally i have relied on chairman minows book abandoned in the wasteland children television and the first amendment as my textbook and guiding foundation as a media advocate for children and families
3369021 look ill give you whatever support you need including staying completely away from you
3369022 the demand is so strong it may impact or delay the new countries coming on
3369023 im pretty aware of the fact that anything you do on the internet pretty much should just be considered public
3369024 about what the company intends to do with your data and your information
3369025 like all privacy matters its something that people need to be informed on
3369026 that is why congress at this point is wanting to gather a lot more information because no one knows
3369027 we can understand exactly what each sector of the communications industry is technically capable of doing and how they use the information once they do get access to it
3369028 we dont have any raw data on the identifiable individual
3369029 we will not be using this technology again until such time as all the privacy concerns have been addressed
3369030 i think the best way for me to characterize this is that our understanding of the relief would be that our members would be permitted to carry digital must carry signals in analog period
3369031 such action will allow these systems to provide each must carry stations signal to customers without incurring unnecessary burdensome costs and without having to use their evident limited channel capacity for duplicative signals
3369032 what were saying in this one is if you meet those eligibility requirements then youre not required to carry a high definition version of the broadcast signals to the extent its provided to them for three years after the dtv transition
3369033 if in fact a google property is taking money away from googles partners that is a real problem
3369034 the question in peoples minds is how unbiased can google be as it grows and grows and grows
3369035 when you see knol pages rank high they are there because they have earned their position
3369036 our vision still remains to be the best conduit that we can be connecting people between whatever their search is and the answer they are looking for
3369037 for that reason we are not interested in owning or creating content
3369038 our job which is to organize that information kicks in
3369039 google can say they are not in the content business but if they are paying people and distributing and archiving their work it is getting harder to make that case
3369040 they are competing for talent for advertisers and for users
3369041 its always an option but ive never been in a meeting where thats been said
3369042 the licensee was given the license and no money to do the work the commission didnt give them any money and congress didnt give them any money
3369043 they said oh by the way go do this thats kind of a silly way to do business
3369044 everything that was said is important and we understand that
3369045 but its a little like putting the cart before the horse it doesnt make sense for us to try to get into the weeds of how public safety user agreements would be structured when we dont have d block partner and theres no guarantee that the network will ever exist
3369046 right now im focused on trying to get rules developed that will work ensuring that we have a successful auction and negotiating an agreement with the d block winner
3369047 but if this network is not built were not going to get to use more than that 10 mhz anyway
3369048 we provide evidence that a metabolically benign obesity can be identified and that it may protect from insulin resistance and atherosclerosis
3369049 obese individuals with no metabolic abnormalities were more likely to be younger black more physically active and have smaller waists than those with metabolic risk factors
3369050 that both broadcast and online tv platforms are growing simultaneously underlines how they fulfil different needs for viewers and that they can co exist and indeed promote each other
3369051 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
3369052 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
3369053 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
3369054 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
3369055 an essential part of growing up adventurous play both challenges and excites children and helps instil critical life skills constantly wrapping children in cotton wool can leave them ill equipped to deal with stressful or challenging situations they might encounter later in life children both need and want to push their boundaries in order to explore their limits and develop their abilities
3369056 its always hot in darwin the humidity though is nothing like it is here and we expect bouncy pitches
3369057 on the other hand we have five practice games and some practice sessions before the series
3369058 the market share of visits to google in july increased 25 over july 2007 and has grown each month since january in 2008 retention of this increased traffic is also coming into play as google has maintained a consistent returning visitor rate visitors who have visited the website within a 30 day period of 95 each month since october 2007 when hitwise began tracking this metric

3369063 where rose the mountains there to him were friends where rolled the ocean thereon was his home where a blue sky and glowing clime extends he had the passion and the power to roam
3369064 i wanted to live deep and suck the marrow of life to drive life into a corner and reduce it to then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it and publish its meanness to the world or if it were sublime to know it by experience
3369065 two roads diverged in a wood and i i took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference
3369066 i want something durable and long lasting something that will keep up with her
3369067 holding on to my youth but it only shows on the outside
3369068 heaven the essentiality of being where everything achieves its full authenticity is already close to us in friendship
3369069 few things are as healing and life giving as is friendship between woman and man man and woman
3369070 a man needs something which is more than friendship and yet is not love as it is generally understood this something nevertheless a woman only can give
3369071 few things are likelier to kill a friendship quicker than a careful and strictly adhered to theory of what qualities are needed in friend
3369072 i do not wish to treat friendships daintily but with the roughest courage when they are real they are not glass threads or frostwork but the solidest things we know
3369073 authentic friendship is notoriously different and inescapably risky true friendships are not relationships we control but adventures we enter into
3369074 it is more important who they are as people and only then it is important who they are as dancers
3369075 there is a love that does not desire to possess it is called friendship when friendship is the determining force in a relationship individuals are able to find themselves and a passion for life not merely lose themselves in love
3369076 in this kingdom the distinctions and barriers between male and female were to be broken down to actualize the potential of any love in this case a male and female love of friendship can be to participate in the building of a kingdom of love spiritual friendships shared by men and women can be eschatological signs
3369077 friendship forms friendship is a much underestimated aspect of spirituality its every bit as significant as prayer and fasting like the sacramental use of water and bread and wine friendship takes what is common in human experience and turns it into something holy

3369096 it is not right that we charge our police with combating crime and disorder and then tie their hands behind their backs in the name of whitehall bureaucracy
3369097 revising the ripa framework so that authorisation and all the paperwork that goes with it is not required for basic police work is just one way the conservatives will cut red tape to free more police onto our streets
3369098 do you know about the deal guys a free burrito if you give us your business card
3369099 only 15 percent of adults who use a mobile and who have a child in their household are aware of age verification systems
3369100 we therefore recommend that mobile operators redouble their efforts to ensure that the information supplied by retailers customer services and websites is easy to understand and is accessible this is particularly important where the default setting for content controls is off

3369104 the balls rolling we just need to keep that ball rolling
3369105 i was able to get my head together and swim well today a lot of it was in my head
3369106 ive chatted with other developers and weve all come to some similar private conclusions about subversions future first we think that this will probably be the final centralized system that gets written in the open source world it represents the end of the line for this model of code collaboration it will continue to be used for many years but specifically it will gain huge mindshare in the corporate world while eventually losing mindshare to distributed systems in the open source arena
3369107 need to focus on making subversion the best tool for organizations whose users need to interact with repositories in complex ways
3369108 subversions read authorization doesnt prevent you from copying checkouts anyway
3369109 putting all of the current source code on everyones machine is infeasible
3369110 svn is a good implementation of a model of version control which is being rapidly left in the dust
3369111 i wouldnt use svn for a new moderately sized open source project
3369112 its taken a while to arrive mostly because most people just dont need it
3369113 but these issues arent real because hard drives are big
3369114 waaah waaah subversion can still do things dvcs gt cant
3369115 html files should automatically be marked with text html context type
3369116 c files should automatically get this and that svn keywords
3369117 svk is a decentralized version control system built with the robust subversion filesystem it supports repository mirroring disconnected operation history sensitive merging and integrates with other version control systems as well as popular visual merge tools

3369119 con la decadencia del nivel educativo e intelectual de los uruguayos que es un proceso que viene desde hace tiempo ha deca do tambi n el nivel parlamentario y se hace m s necesaria la actividad de institutos como ste
3369120 hay una insatisfacci n con el nivel de los legisladores que es de larga data
3369121 se ha tomado conciencia de la dificultad de la labor parlamentaria y de la necesidad de una preparaci n m s espec fica m s all del nivel cultural o profesional que tengan los legisladores
3369122 en cada legislatura s lo se reeligen cinco o seis de cada diez diputados en promedio si nicamente el 50 o 60 tiene una experiencia anterior existe un problema de falta de conocimiento del trabajo parlamentario del trabajo en comisiones de familiaridad con los temas
3369123 los legisladores de los partidos tradicionales permanec an m s en sus puestos ahora predomina el frente amplio y dentro de l muchos sectores con menor experiencia partidaria eso puede incidir un poco en la gesti n
3369124 ser a razonable que se hiciera un llamado al que se pudiera presentar cualquier ciudadano pero est bien que sea as porque los partidos seleccionan a aquellos que demuestran su vocaci n su nimo su capacidad de liderazgo
3369125 se hizo de esa forma por una cuesti n pr ctica y para respetar la representaci n que hay hoy en el poder legislativo no creo que sea la nica forma v lida de seleccionar al alumnado pero creo que funciona
3369126 en mi caso como estudiante de arquitectura obtuve una base general en temas que desconoc a como asuntos internacionales o derecho constitucional que mi formaci n pol tica y universitaria no me hab a dado
3369127 muchos de los que ocupan cargos parlamentarios no s lo llegan al puesto por ser muy buenos en algo sino por saber trasladar los problemas de la gente claro que el pol tico debe tener la mejor formaci n posible pero los pol ticos no son t cnicos son pol ticos
3369128 para cuestiones t cnicas los pol ticos se rodean de asesores
3369129 es muy dif cil que un pol tico sepa de todos los temas

3369135 i just wanted to swim my race and set everything up for tomorrow i have to go back and do all that stuff to set myself up for the perfect swim

3369137 i am reassured after our talks that there will be more people going through the pavilions
3369138 we will be in contact with the sponsors and i hope they will be satisfied
3369139 to me its an awesome adventure and im going to learn so much and meet new people and see sports at the highest level
3369140 they took us on a long weekend trip to the great wall summer palace and brought us to eat peking duck it was a weekend straight of just going to all places
3369141 we cast the net as wide as possible and none other of the major contenders were involved
3369142 i think its going to take about what the world record is now to get onto the podium
3369143 the main thing was to qualify among the first 16
3369144 it doesnt matter whether you are first second fourth or eighth im fourth knowing that at the end i slowed down a bit so everything is cool
3369145 it was definitely difficult because monday was a finals situation
3369146 today was preliminaries i didnt really have the focus i had yesterday i was just looking to get out of my heat and i did what i had to do to get by
3369147 theres a lot of fast swimmers ive just got to swim my own race and do what i can do
3369148 i know im capable of doing a lot and thats what i plan on doing
3369149 ive just got to play it down and enjoy the moment and focus on the days ahead
3369150 thats what the chinese always do so well against us they fight when theyre down and come back they never give you anything so it was fantastic to turn that on them for a change
3369151 it might have meant a tiny bit more being chinese opponents in the first round in china
3369152 and the fact she beat us in the olympic final four years ago might have given us a little bit of more incentive but hey it is the olympic games
3369153 if we go out and happen to win tomorrow its going to be like usa basketball vs china that type of deal
3369154 a great film the cast is just uniformly excellent here
3369155 bring along your home grown or public fruit and any clean empty glass jars you have at the end everyone will leave with a jar of communal jam the kinds of jam we make will improvise on the fruit that people provide the fruit can be fresh or frozen fallen fruit will bring public fruit we are looking for radical and experimental jams as well like basil guava or lemon pepper jelly well discuss the basics of jam and jelly making pectin and bindings as well as the communal power of shared fruit and the liberation of public fruit
3369156 lets not let the truth get in the way of a good argument
3369157 it is standard operating procedure for a judge to order no contact with any witnesses and that can include the family
3369158 because normally the written order controls a careful attorney will make sure its on the record
3369159 one has to assume the true motivation behind this action is to build campaign support for the next gubernatorial election and divert attention away from his own personal issues that may stand in the way of his ambitions
3369160 trade fundamentals have turned sour in the last several weeks however with growth weakening for key trading partners and the dollar appreciating
3369161 we are not buying a whole lot of goods from anywhere
3369162 we would characterize the results themselves as largely disappointing with weak inflows and underlying investment bank division revenues
3369163 however risk asset reductions governance improvements and proposed separation of the units may be better received
3369164 disappointing but not surprising given the recent performance and intense negative publicity
3369165 we have no intention whatsoever to sell our investment bank or any of our businesses
3369166 however a sale of the investment bank would seem impossible in the near term given that stand alone funding models will not be implemented until the end of 2009
3369167 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3369168 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3369169 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3369170 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3369171 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3369172 enter into immediate talks about resolving the investigation as that would be in the best interests of both consumers nationwide as well as wachovia customers

3369174 the issue was caused by a temporary outage in our contacts system that was preventing gmail from loading properly

3369176 its misleading its snake oil salesmanship of the worst order
3369177 were gonna drill offshore were gonna drill here and were gonna drill now
3369178 we have to drill here and drill now drill here and drill now
3369179 we knew that we were going to face the best players in the world
3369180 it was a lot of fun even though it was very hard because they pressed us a lot you just have to take a lot of good things from this game because they are the best
3369181 what i will remember is the play in the second quarter the usa was on a fastbreak and somebody passed the ball to lebron and he dunked it with his left hand it think it was amazing
3369182 just to line up the airlift sorties wouldve taken weeks
3369183 theres no way you can defend in particular john edwards lack of honesty with the american public
3369184 no falta el chanta o pseudo profesional que crea que el cambio siempre es bueno la continuidad es algo neceseario

3369186 because we almost have to shut off that emotion on the field but when i talk to people about them instantly the tears and the emotion comes out its hard
3369187 i know shell probably have some nerves so im really feeling them with her but i told her before the game that wed be there with her every pitch
3369188 who can just sit and watch and eat a slice of pizza and drink a coke and carry on a conversation
3369189 but its also good in that were an escape for one another

3369216 tetris wouldnt be released today in the casual games space unless it had a story mode about you working your way across the world looking for clues about your missing uncle one tetris round at a time sadly i think casual games have started to feel some of that bloat of traditional games adding features and fluff to the point of obscuring the core gameplay
3369217 match 3 games such as bejeweled will never die however the casual consumer is becoming more sophisticated in their tastes a simple match 3 game might do well on a cell phone where youre looking for a few minutes of fun in between other things but thats not what youre going to seek out to download for me time
3369218 we have been hoping that cisco would merge the two channel partner programs into a unified smb partner program that would span products services and support
3369219 a single cisco relationship will definitely mitigate challenges and simplify how we do business with our channel partner community quite simply the whole is more than the sum of the parts for cisco and linksys
3369220 the smb market continues to present tremendous growth potential for cisco and our channel partners and we have been successfully serving the sector with solutions from both cisco and linksys
3369221 we believe that taking a coordinated approach across technology and go to market strategies is a natural evolution that brings greater synergies to our customers and channel partners alike this includes an array of channel program benefits to meet the broad requirements presented by our partners customer base all designed to increase revenue potential and enable us to focus collectively on serving the smb customer

3369233 hothead has brought both downloadable episodic games to both pc and console with this penny arcade partnership and along the way learned some valuable lessons from the difficulty of working with fresh licensors to the trouble with and benefits of outsourcing a sidebar from jerry tycho holkins and cover art from mike gabe krahulik round out the piece
3369234 apart from coming to terms with the sheer amount of work they had to do probably the biggest shock for the penny arcade guys was seeing a game that was half finished
3369235 as developers we took for granted that we could look at the game when it was midway through production and envision where it would end up as additional layers of polish were added
3369236 the game length problems were exacerbated by their lack of experience as well story and dialogue are the key factors that determine the length of an episode and those items came directly from penny arcade
3369237 since virtually no one at hothead had worked on adventure games before it was like the blind leading the blind with no one having intuition about how the current story translated into game length this was one of the factors that led us to work with lucasarts adventure game veteran ron gilbert
3369238 a final issue was managing who was in charge of certain decisions as we progressed it became clear that the dividing line between their responsibilities and hotheads was blurry
3369239 for example the nonlinear dialogue trees in the game are all script jerry wrote every word but finding your way through the dialogue is gameplay and the type of information that gets revealed reiterated or emphasized during each dialogue encounter is key to making a solid adventure game and to ensuring that the player is always aware of what she or he needs to be doing
3369240 and yet numerous times during the project we noticed the scope creeping larger as the team fell into old habits we all had from making larger games destined for retail
3369241 at one point the issue grew to such an extent that we had to step back and rethink how big we were making the game we realized we were setting a trend with the first episode that we would need to maintain with future releases these adjustments were not easy to make and cost us extra time
3369242 as a large portion of the team rolled onto the second installment i started hearing discussions on the team that made it clear we were thinking about episode two
3369243 looking ahead we will have to ask ourselves if we are sticking to those practices or if we are sliding back into older more familiar habits that will prevent us from reaching our goals
3369244 focusing our company on selling games online and funding the games ourselves meant that we could remain independent of publishers
3369245 this model was a big change for everyone at hothead with virtually all our veteran staff coming from work for hire developers the change in dynamic was most evident because we were no longer shipping off monthly milestones to a publisher
3369246 despite the appeal of this we realized midway that monthly milestones provide a convenient pressure to keep a project on track we had to come up with other ways to motivate ourselves to hit interim milestones a surprisingly difficult task when they are not tied directly to revenue
3369247 despite that it was a refreshing change to be able to make a game from beginning to end answering only to ourselves
3369248 learn to get in touch with the silence within yourself and know that everything in life has purpose there are no mistakes no coincidences all events are blessings given to us to learn from
3369249 people are like stained glass windows they sparkle and shine when the sun is out but when the darkness sets in their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within
3369250 its only when we truly know and understand that we have a limited time on earth and that we have no way of knowing when our time is up we will then begin to live each day to the fullest as if it was the only one we had
3369251 should you shield the canyons from the windstorms you would never see the true beauty of their carvings
3369252 there are no mistakes no coincidences all events are blessings given to us to learn from
3369253 i believe that we are solely responsible for our choices and we have to accept the consequences of every deed word and thought throughout our lifetime
3369254 the ultimate lesson all of us have to learn is unconditional love which includes not only others but ourselves as well
3369255 how do geese know when to fly to the sun who tells them the seasons how do we humans know when it is time to move on as with the migrant birds so surely with us there is a voice within if only we would listen to it that tells us certainly when to go forth into the unknown

3369322 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3369323 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3369324 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3369325 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3369326 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3369327 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process

3369346 france has continued its military presence and cooperation in rwanda in a context of ethnic tensions of massacres and violence as if impervious to a situation the graveness of which it had underestimated
3369347 the mission can not completely discard the idea that a french instructor might for diverse reasons punctually have given more effective assistance in helping to use some piece of artillery or in any other situation despite the instructions from the high command of the army but it seemed very difficult in that critical situation to assess exactly when instruction and training became actual engagement
3369348 even if france has not engaged in combat it has nevertheless intervened in the field in a way extremely close to the far it has continuously participated in elaborating fighting plans given advice to the army high command and to sector commanders proposing reorganization and new tactics it has dispatched consultants to instruct the far in advanced weaponry it has taught techniques of ambush and placing mines suggesting the most appropriate places for those
3369349 the french soldiers did not engage in combat moreover given the dilapidated state of the rwandan high command incapable to indicate the front line and the position of its troops on a map could one really say this was simply an assistance mission or was it about advice and support in this context of re establishment it is hardly surprising that some french military officials had the impression that they were setting up an army which moreover had to be supplied with arms
3369350 in case of crisis priority should be given to negotiated solutions in an african context yet this option should not mean the renunciation of our traditional bilateral military cooperation programs
3369351 in no way has france incited encouraged helped or supported those who orchestrated the genocide and started it in the days following the attack on the plane carrying president habyarimana
3369352 he did not know of the existence of the militias
3369353 we knew that the interahamwe existed but we didnt know exactly what they were about
3369354 even if the existence of the militias was known it is clear that the french military presence in the first quarter of 1994 has in no way been implicated through whichever of its missions in the training of the militias
3369355 one of the political objectives of france was to avoid a military victory of the rpf because france did not consider this as an internal conflict but rather an external aggression initially it considered the rpf as a military force with ugandan origins rather than a group of rwandan refugees who wanted to return to their country
3369356 frances policies did pay sufficient attention to the racist deviation of the rwandan regime
3369357 was not to support the regime in place but rather to continuously and relentlessly pressure president habyarimana to share the power
3369358 who made great efforts to encourage peace negotiations between the rwandan government and the rpf
3369359 supplies of weapons and equipment continued after the byumba offensive in june 1992 and the signature of a ceasefire in arusha in july 1992 which was the starting point for the agreements of the same name the opening of the arusha peace negotiations which france actively supported on a diplomatic level did not constitute in the opinion of the ministry of foreign affairs a new element that should affect the contractual environment of the weapons and munitions orders placed by rwanda
3369360 france estimated that reinforcing its military aid to the rwandan government was the only way to escape the logic of war by forcing the rpf to sit down at the negotiations table unfortunately and that was the error in the reasoning the will of the rwandan government to reach peace was taken for granted yet the situation was more complicated and in the end france was helping a government to prepare the war it wanted
3369361 this mission the operation turquoise was based on the idea of stabilizing the front line thus dividing rwanda in two parts in order to reinforce the negotiation capacities of both parties
3369362 this means that at that precise moment june 20 1994 france still recognized the legitimacy of the interim government so either it did not take into account the reality of the genocide or it did not correctly assess the responsibility of the rwandan government in this respect

3369374 its not the way we wanted to start but we can only go on from that and take it as a bad day get on with it and work hard to go and show the fans that it was a blip and its gone
3369375 the effort was there we worked away but when you go 2 0 down after four minutes its such a hard task to get back into the game
3369376 but i wouldnt read too much into it it was just a bad day at the office and were going to have to work 100 per cent to prove to the fans and the manager that it was a bad day and we can go on and do very well in this league
3369377 the players know its not acceptable to play like that for the manager for the fans we cant let that happen again and i can safely say i dont think we will
3369378 people are going to argue that weve got talent in the team weve got some great players we just need to string it all together now and get going
3369379 hopefully we can put the weekend to bed and start afresh tonight and kick on
3369380 its an opportunity to score goals an opportunity to get a win a wins always good because it breeds confidence and thats what we need at the moment we need to get a win under our belt
3369381 for the club its great to have a cup run but for the players as well the confidence of winning games can only be a good thing
3369382 i think its satisfying to score a goal but id rather not have scored and won the game which anyone would
3369383 but i always work hard and try to score goals i may not always do it but i think fans and people appreciate that 100 per cent is all you can give and if you do that you can go home a happy man and do no more
3369384 ive scored the last three years ive played there so its a good ground for me
3369385 its a beautiful ground anyway but it didnt feel like that on saturday
3369386 the manager loves his football and obviously hes very passionate but if you go away on the first game of the season and lose 4 1 you feel the wrath of any manager
3369387 i think it was deserved and the lads have taken it on board
3369388 the festival has taken a very big step forward this year inviting the dancers from asia was a really good idea because when you look at their cultural dances you realize that they are not so different from ours at the same time the festival showed the different identities we have in africa every dance you see means and shows a certain group of people
3369389 it was the first time that i attended fespad i missed it last year and was determined not to repeat that this year the ministry of culture should continue to organize such events because it gives us a chance to get to know the african cultures
3369390 compared to 2006 it was much better because we have had a chance of seeing many different cultural dances from both africa and asia it was an occasion to see different cultures which we have never seen and known i really loved the chinese dances so much
3369391 many people in rural areas would also love to see what fespad is and know what is happening in the world they are missing a lot i hope the organizers think about it next time
3369392 look at that japanese dance we saw which was meant to ask rain from the gods the dance has a meaning and an origin much as we dont understand the japanese language but at least after the dance they explained it to us and the movements made sense
3369393 why dont these people care about what i care about
3369394 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3369395 it definitely would be a great result but im sure theyll be guarding against that
3369396 its going to be as tough a game as we could possibly get
3369397 weve got players who have aspirations to play at a higher level some of them may think they should be playing higher already but all i want is for my players to go out and play to the best of their abilities
3369398 things should take care of themselves in regard to the lads being up for it
3369399 we generally acquit ourselves well when we go and play better teams and hopefully that will be the case
3369400 we were very disappointed to lose to watford a couple of years ago on penalties especially after we beat nottingham forest
3369401 and then last year we put up a great performance against leicester and were unfortunate to lose so well just go there and give it our best shot
3369402 we have got a lot of players who are keen to prove a point

3369413 if i may can i take this night to ask of you the questions that have been haunting my mind since the night before i only ask that you answer honestly
3369414 first there is something you are not telling me about those demons why do they attempt to take your life
3369415 you have met most of my siblings kumbakarna vibishana and ravana there is one who you do not know his name is kuvera and he is the god of riches and wealth he once ruled lanka though ravana overthrew him and exiled him to the himalayas kuvera has many loyal followers and it is my belief that those demons you fought are part of his army
3369416 it is the rest of the family vibishana and i are his only living relatives and we were close to ravana
3369417 he was the best ravana was to us a friend a confidante a guide a protector that is why vibishana himself was in tears at his death despite his belief that what our brother was doing was wrong
3369418 beautiful prince i was the cause of all your trouble i told ravana to take revenge on you and he fell so in love with your brothers wife that he he overstepped boundaries
3369419 demons too have a code of honor that is why there are those like vibishana
3369420 you do not seem truly evil princess nor are you noble or good
3369421 i was i was made to love lakshmana perhaps it was a curse that i loved and loved and was turned away every time i made many mistakes in the past though now i have learned my lesson
3369422 and i am a creature of pleasure if nothing else
3369423 i do not bind myself to any code or any religion life has not been kind to me therefore i live only for seeking pleasure and bliss surely lakshmana surely you must have also longed for something else something more than the chains that bind you to your brothers and your home
3369424 now i know this might sound a bit racist but
3369425 can you tell us how to get to the one for southwest airlines
3369426 its about 45 minutes from here at the other airport
3369427 before i tell you what happened let me preface this by saying we have three month old twins and we left our brains elsewhere
3369428 some days i feel like shit some days i wanna quit and just be normal for a bit
3369429 my thoughts just before the first real college game of my life the honor of my race family and self are at stake
3369430 everyone is expecting me to do big things i will
3369431 it was inventive on his part ill give him that
3369432 my thoughts just before the first real college game of my life the honor of my race family and self are at stake
3369433 everyone is expecting me to do big things i will
3369434 bounced and rolled just under 300 feet landing in a ditch
3369435 when i came to i knew i had rebroken my collarbone
3369436 when the police and fireman got there they asked me wheres the guy who was in the wreck
3369437 my friend i would not be writing you this letter unless i honestly knew i could win this race
3369438 i am the democratic partys worst nightmare because i am a black republican woman and im running for a seat in the u s house of representatives
3369439 bmw direct mailer for georgia republican lands on iowa doorstep of weekly standard reader
3369440 very surprisingly abbey who is not a dominant female went up to brighter and gently took bolo off her and placed her on her chest
3369441 what was surprising was that brighter didnt try to take bolo back it was obvious to everyone that abbey was much more protective than brighter ever was and that was the kind of protection we were looking for
3369442 this gives abbey and the other females a chance to experience aspects of motherhood which is a really important thing for gorillas
3369443 when they havent got that they get bored and might display unnatural behavior having bolo in the group is a very calming influence
3369444 that gate thats out there that green gate beyond that is probably five to six feet deep in the middle and it was all the way up to the road for weeks and weeks and weeks
3369445 i concerned with them being in our im sorry but our septic water and all the contaminants that are in the farming area and the land that they were standing on got to be so soft that they were in danger we were endangering their health so we got them out on june 15
3369446 we had a number of pumps anywhere from an inch and a half to four inch pumps laid out in that end of the west yard over there and we were pumping across the road that farmer gave us permission to pump on his already flooded property
3369447 we had an excavator come in and build a berm almost all the way across our property so that we could start digging holes and putting pumps in and pumping the water over so that we could begin to dry out around our house the land around our house because we just had numerous inlets of water coming in through our basement and it decimated our septic system which youll see here shortly
3369448 any water that you use throughout the day has to be caught in a pan or a bucket and has to be dumped outside its fine for summer because is dries quickly but were going to run out of warm days and nights in a big hurry and ive been worrying about this for over a month
3369449 its my nightly attire at least until the sun goes down
3369450 were just trying to eliminate some of the ground water close to the house hopefully thats benefitting us eliminating some of the water going into the basement
3369451 i do love the home we both do of course we do we bought it but they make other houses if we need to go we need to go if we need to do some work we need to do some work but we need some help getting started
3369452 that little trick puts the mic directly in front of your hot steaming chat box

3369457 you wanna go catch some breakfast at and then run some errands
3369458 i need to make a stop at the license bureau
3369459 i went in a couple of months ago to get a replacement title for my motorcycle and it hasnt come yet i thought they said theyd mail it to me i must have been wrong
3369460 thank you ive just finished training and this is my first non training day
3369461 so your ex wouldnt hold on to the envelope for you and maybe pass it on during one of the child exchanges
3369462 didnt you just take the boys for an extra week so she wouldnt have to find 24 hour a day day care and spend untold hours worrying about the safety and well being of the boys
3369463 and didnt she send an e mail saying she was going to pick up the boys midweek last week and didnt you make plans to do stuff that wednesday thursday and friday
3369464 and didnt you find out thursday which would have been one day after the wednesday in question that shed seemingly changed the pick up date as shed gone out of town with a guy those days
3369465 and isnt there more to that story which might make your ex sound less insane
3369466 yes but those things might just be coincidence i have a sense that without the coincidental things that came up the wednesday date would have been changed without any prior suggestion of that to me
3369467 in any case everything was ok my kids were visiting my brother and being dragged around behind a boat that weekend there was a chance theyd have been gone until thursday anyway the fact they were home by tuesday was sort of happenstance
3369468 in any case its a good thing your plans were flexible
3369469 wasnt that the only time youd ever asked for help like that in all the years because it kills you to ask for favors do i remember you telling me that after 32 hours of waiting you finally sent her an e mail telling her to forget it as your plans had changed
3369470 hmp do you think this all came about as youve pissed her off royally
3369471 i remember now there was that incident in early may at the play which led you to eventually mention something that upset her not long after that her e mails became fewer and sort of short i think the longest one shes sent you since then was the one not long after you pissed her off in which she expressed her gratitude over your taking the kids for an extra week in july i believe it was that mail in which she mentioned the wednesday pickup i think you mentioned you thought that mail was her way of saying even though im super pissed at you i will gladly let you do me a big favor
3369472 if my lats were like my memory id have no complaints in life
3369473 do you think you could fictionalize it a little bit
3369474 maybe you could pretend there were three of us to obfuscate things
3369475 three of us thats a lot of dialog to type who do you think i am i think pretending there were two of us will be obfuscation enough

3369477 why is it i always end up with the whack job friend following a divorce

3369479 it is never too late to be what you might have been
3369480 no crisis comes completely out of the blue there are always clues and advance warnings if you can only interpret them correctly
3369481 its absurd to argue that ending the moratorium on drilling off parts of the u s coasts would quickly bring down the high price of gasoline this chimera is being touted by president george w bush and other republican politicians including the partys presumptive presidential nominee senator john mccain of arizona to deflect blame for what its costing for a fill up to get around the fact that it would be a decade or more before any oil would be likely to flow a few partisan analysts have said that the cost of gasoline would fall right away they argue that the prospect of additional oil supply in the future would lead oil companies to produce more oil immediately because they would expect prices for crude to be lower later on well wouldnt that depend on whether a producer had the capacity to pump more oil today and whether it thought lifting the moratorium would add a significant amount of oil to future supply relative to future demand there are good reasons to question whether another 1 million or 2 million barrels of crude a day would make much difference in prices when world consumption is running at 85 million barrels a day about a fourth of all u s oil production is already coming from offshore wells primarily in the central and western portions of the gulf of mexico that arent covered by the moratorium
3369482 we are at the beginning stages of a massive bidding war in uranium
3369483 china is doing massive deals in africa and is now working on ever bigger deals in kazakhstan
3369484 china is basically locking up uranium supplies this effectively means that there will be even less uranium for the rest of the world players

3369499 the weather was somewhat cooler than it has been and that was nice it was a smooth race and we had a lot of competition out here this year
3369500 i would say i ran the race comfortably hard today
3369501 i definitely didnt max out today hopefully my season will be going into november so i didnt want to run on all burners i ran hard though i was working out there
3369502 i havent run a 5 mile race for five years the first mile i said to myself what am i doing i havent run this fast in years but i was able to hang on chris is the reason i was able to run so fast he pulled me along
3369503 my plan was just to stick with chris because i knew he was able to run under 27 minutes
3369504 i thought maybe i could run under a 27 i was pretty satisfied with my time it was a really good time it was the best time i could have hoped for so i was very happy with it
3369505 it wasnt really too hard i felt like i was running pretty easy today it was a nice course i liked the out and back layout the bike trail is really nice
3369506 i run in college and we needed to run a 5 mile tempo run
3369507 its just a lot easier to run it in a race than it is to run it in ashville by myself
3369508 i looked the race up on runohio com and decided to come try it everyone is very friendly here and it was a great day if i am still running next year i will definitely come back
3369509 it goes down the bike trail where it gets really shady and cools you off its the perfect course to run a good time i only ran once road race this summer and i chose this one
3369510 a power take off operating at 1 000 rpm will pull in clothing at a rate of 8 feet per second

3369512 it was really good training and its stuff you dont get to see all the time
3369513 once we got to extra innings we felt like whichever team could score first and break the others will and spirit would win the game it was one heck of a game when two teams battle like this you hate to see anyone lose the ohio team is a great great baseball team i feel for them right now and my heart goes out to them they gave it everything they had as well as our kids did it is hard to lose
3369514 we felt like the momentum was going to switch when we tied it up but we couldnt capitalize and get another run across
3369515 the mount vernon pitchers kept shutting us down over and over
3369516 dale did a good job and obviously in this game everybody was focused so there were some good defensive plays
3369517 jayben did a nice job but had a little bit of control problems thats why he had to exit in the fifth inning josh edwards came in and did a tremendous job but i never felt like we were in control or on the verge of winning it it was a fight the whole way
3369518 i felt good about our chances we were the home team and had the last at bats in sixth seventh eighth ninth and 10th innings we had opportunity after opportunity we just didnt take advantage of it we had our chances we cant say we didnt
3369519 they will look back and think about how close they were we went 11 innings with the eventual great lakes champion once that sting is over the fond memories will be there and they will see the big picture they were one of the top 16 teams in the nation thats something they can be proud of

3369530 people want choices people want the opportunity to make their own decisions
3369531 they come in and they look and they go were overwhelmed
3369532 since reagan the ideology in the united states has been that choice is good and more choice is better and to the extent that you can give people more choice in every area of life you are improving their well being
3369533 nobody has the time or the expertise to make informed choices about everything
3369534 when options are presented people have a tough time just ignoring them
3369535 its wonderful that we can sit down in our living room and order 20 000 things in a superficial way we are more informed than people used to be but its hard to get our attention and i dont see any way of turning that around

3369542 institutions are breaking down and there are going to be new ways of doing things but the cream can still rise the signal can still make it through the noise in this new environment
3369543 you dont need 90 percent of the public informed on the issue and following it closely to get your policy passed
3369544 not everybody was running around yelling yeah yeah liberty death

3369552 the hispanic community is heavily involved in the operations of hotels with spanish spoken at approximately 90 percent of all hotels in the region
3369553 historically the latino community has not been a major player in ownership largely because of the hotel industrys complexity and understanding of investment opportunities that is why hhoa was founded to educate the hispanic community and provide a forum to exchange ideas and build networking relationships we now have more than 300 members and significant support from the leading hotel companies hhoa members have been involved in the acquisition or development of nearly 50 hotels in the past 12 months and we see that number accelerating

3369556 i don t know whether it s fair that a mercedes benz cost 90 000 i just know if i want one that s what i ve got to pay so i look at this kind of stuff as look there are people all over the country who are willing to put x dollars on the table for a football team or x dollars on the table for an auto assembly plant or anything else like that

3369584 thats right yeah ive had a team working on this over the past few weeks and what weve come up with can be reduced to two fundamental concepts one people are not wearing enough hats two matter is energy in the universe there are many energy fields which we cannot normally perceive some energies have a spiritual source which act upon a persons soul however this soul does not exist ab initio it has to be brought into existence by a process of guided self observation however this is rarely achieved owing to mans unique ability to be distracted from spiritual matters by everyday trivia

3369613 the two most startling figures are at the high and low ends of the scale although the richest taxpayers make 16 1 of the money they pay 33 7 of the taxes while those in the bottom 50 make 14 2 of the money but only pay 3 5 of the taxes
3369614 what we will try and do is convey the type of confidence we have in the measures that are in place
3369615 i think its not easy to convince people that are feeling uncertain about something
3369616 it is a difficult task but we have to do our best and inshallah we will be able to convince them
3369617 the first thing we should look at is what we can do what we will try and do is convey the type of confidence we have in the measures that are in place hence why we will go to member countries to convince them
3369618 youve got to remember that unfortunately they sit far away and theyve not been to pakistan they might not share the sentiment that we do and it would be good of us to go and explain to them exactly what measures are in place and raise their levels of confidence
3369619 some of us whove been here feel satisfied with the security measures if we can convince them then there is no issue
3369620 on the other hand we can never force anybody to come and play in the competition we will do our very best to convince them the member countries have signed participation agreements to send their teams
3369621 weve had two very entertaining days in pakistan we got into islamabad and met with officials and diplomats in the day we then proceeded to lahore to get a physical demonstration of the security measures that have largely been recommended in various security consultant reports and observed them similarly weve observed them in karachi

3369623 we are following up later this week with a journey down to australia and new zealand as well as simultaneously down the other side to england and south africa where we will share with them the observations and the kind of comfort level that we have observed and noted and lets see what comes out of that journey
3369624 the rise of china in particular represents the great unfolding drama of this new century
3369625 how china responds to these forces will radically shape the future course of our country
3369626 which means how countries such as singapore and australia seek to influence chinas view of its role and responsibility in the merging global and regional order is also of great importance
3369627 of course im concerned but at the same time particularly in this later case this was a string of bad luck
3369628 we are in a very very difficult environment in afghanistan accidents will occur and of course are unavoidable
3369629 if the injuries had been life threatening there would have been assets deployed and the commanders on the ground would have taken a greater risk launching that aircraft out of kandahar
3369630 obviously we need to balance the risk to the wounded soldiers to the risk to the aeroplane and the air crew
3369631 i do apologise to you for my 2003 letter which was poorly drafted and i regret open to interpretations which i did not intend
3369632 i expected an apology in which he admitted he got the whole thing wrong until that happens there will be no peace
3369633 the matter is not concluded yet and it is a lot better to try to make progress on these issues at a personal level rather than through the press

3369639 the graduation rate is a crucial indicator of whether our school system is fulfilling its core mission giving our children the skills they need to become successful adults
3369640 after a decade of near stagnation new york citys graduation rate has climbed significantly since 2002 we clearly need to help larger numbers of students to graduate but the progress weve made so far means that thousands more students are graduating today than would have six years ago
3369641 todays numbers confirm once again that steady progress is now the rule not the exception in new york citys public schools
3369642 although im pleased that the overall graduation rate is continuing to rise its especially encouraging to see that the biggest increases are among our black and hispanic students this is further evidence that were beginning to close the shameful racial achievement gap in this city
3369643 today is a day to congratulate teachers principals students and parents for all their hard work in keeping the graduation rate going in the right direction
3369644 tomorrow we must ask ourselves what more can we do to get our kids ready for college to enter the workforce to improve their life skills thats going to require continued collaboration by everyone with a stake in our kids education and in so doing we will dramatically increase the graduation rates
3369645 we are seeing gradual steady increases in student graduation rates because school leaders teachers and parents are truly working together to improve student learning and ensure every child receives a quality education
3369646 student achievement has always been a priority for school leaders and while there is still more work to be done with the proper resources we will continue to make progress

3369655 the album mesoscaphe is a sound work dedicated to the 1969 voyage of the ben franklin the naturally propelled submarine created to explore the currents of the gulf stream and the nature of the sea half of the sound is composed of original pieces of music meant to symbolize a deepening human element culled from memory from strings pianos and electronics the other half of the sound is composed of natural field recordings of the ben franklin itself as well as the surrounding oceans and habitats with the intention of providing realism through sound just as if it were an actual document from the voyage of the surrounding ocean the artists exchanged their own original sounds with each other allowing each artist to experiment and remix outside of their own sound sources with the potential to apply our own sound methods to each others sound sources and develop the concept even further titles were made to coordinate with the movement of the voyage creating their own story in relation to the progressing sounds the final result is a documented literary and audio interpretation of the voyage from the perspective of 3 sound and visual artists of the experiences and surroundings of the crew of the ben franklin traveling for 30 days by the gentle glide of the gulf stream we hope to bring attention to an important event in history overshadowed by the moon landings and for people to know the story of the revolutionary submarine that explored the nature of the ocean challenged scientific development and ended up in a salvage yard

3369662 we are already cutting taxes this year by around 4 billion
3369663 that is in part to help support the economy at a difficult time whether it is increasing tax credits or tax allowances or freezing fuel duty at a rate below inflation
3369664 but i think everybody recognises that it is not possible for governments to fully insulate whether it is households or businesses from these kinds of world oil prices that we have seen
3369665 while we still think that the mpc could cut interest rates before the end of the year a cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3369666 a perilously weak economy has prevented the bank of englands monetary policy committee tightening policy but inflation is likely to prevent rate cuts before early next year
3369667 these figures show that things are only getting tighter for families across the uk
3369668 its clear that inflation is not being driven by pay but by shifts in energy and food prices across the world
3369669 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year

3369915 these guys were just going out and asking people to come for the bible study
3369916 i didnt even understand his english he was talking to me by signals and i understood the invitation from his signals
3369917 sometimes we dont know the importance when we go out to invite people to come to bible study
3369918 sometimes we think this is wasting time this guy had no idea who i was
3369919 they studied the bible with me and figured out who i was only five months later
3369920 they got to know me and even got to know my father he invited them to our house and they had no idea that he was one of the top leaders of the hamas organization
3369921 i didnt have enough knowledge about christianity i was open minded
3369922 i never had in my mind in that moment that i would go this far to become a believer i had studied history and thought this would be a good chance to study to meet new international people and see what they are saying it was definitely not about christianity
3369923 he was invited to a bible study to me this is profound
3369924 some guy didnt know who joseph was this guy was just a normal christian he wasnt an apologist he wasnt a specialist he was
3369925 they just shared the love of christ and he went home and read his bible this is such a testimony to all us christians that we need to present everyone with the simple gospel this is a call for everyone to stand out
3369926 when he was exposed to the word of god the holy spirit did a work on him and look what happened
3369927 just to stop and think for a minute about announcing your christianity you feel sick immediately because its crazy
3369928 youre not just saying goodbye to a religion to a tradition
3369929 suddenly you are starting from scratch and canceling everything you have in society
3369930 but when it started i was ready for any circumstances i thought about the worst conditions that could happen as consequences after my announcement but and i tell you this is a miracle this is how god works you carry the cross and rely on him completely and he takes care of everything
3369931 this may be the first case that a well known muslim just goes to the public and says i am a christian
3369932 many muslim sheiks many muslim imams may be converted to christianity but they keep that a secret they didnt announce it because it is very embarrassing for them and for their families they were
3369933 but i decided to declare jesus in front of the world so he declares me in front of the father
3369934 that was the main reason i am going to be just worshiping god in a very special way by doing this
3369935 when jesus says carry your cross and follow me it wasnt to put a cross on your shirt and keep walking the street
3369936 i have met politicians i have met presidents and prime ministers i have met all the leaders of that region
3369937 even if they have a way out of this endless circle of violence between the two nations none of them have the courage to do it
3369938 both sides have many parties and every party has its own agenda there are no strong leaders in that region who can make brave decisions
3369939 jesus is not going to give them a political solution but he has changed me and he can change those people to a better people he can teach them how to forgive how to love
3369940 everybody on both sides is hurt not only israelis not only palestinians

3369990 hes a great hitter and he can drive in runs and hes still a pup too
