1270000 europe is important the premier league is important the fa cup and the carling cup so we will try to win every trophy and you never know
1270001 we will try to win from the first game and then see the situation
1270002 clearly we have confidence in ourselves and have the quality to try to win every game but you never know what can happen in any competition
1270003 we started really well and finished really well last season
1270004 if we can do the same this time then hopefully we will be better in the middle of the season
1270005 i am disappointed and it was a surprise because this is a player who has played in the champions league and been in the argentina squad for the olympic games you have managers talking about how good he is so i think the system needs to change
1270006 now we have to look for a solution maybe find a team for him on loan but we have maybe eight or 10 teams in spain italy and greece asking about him

1270008 een bewijs van de kracht van wikipedia blijkbaar is het heel goed mogelijk om met een grote groep mensen een serieuze encyclopedie samen te stellen met een minimum aan fouten fouten op wikipedia worden namelijk altijd wel een keer door iemand ontdekt dat is nu weer duidelijk aangetoond
1270009 ik juich de toepassing van wikitrust toe omdat het programma de inhoud van wikipedia makkelijker te controleren maakt
1270010 voor de argeloze lezer zijn de kleurcoderingen erg handig om de betrouwbaarheid van een artikel te bepalen
1270011 meestal worden fouten sneller ontdekt dit artikel is in 2004 verschenen toen was wikipedia nog niet zo populair in nederland
1270012 ik had nooit verwacht dat het artikel zolang onontdekt zou blijven eigenlijk had ik gehoopt dat de pagina na een uur al ontdekt zou zijn er was na de ontdekking even sprake van dat ik verwijderd zou worden van wikipedia dat is natuurlijk wel heel slecht voor je reputatie

1270032 the boys and girls who live with hiv are here and we are growing up with many goals
1270033 we want to be artists teachers doctors even get married and have kids but achieving these goals will only be possible when we receive the attention we need when we are guaranteed the medicines that we need when we are accepted in schools
1270034 its like a little ball that has little dots and is inside me sort of swimming inside me
1270035 theres a whole new generation of young people that were born with hiv that are reaching adulthood it presents very interesting challenges
1270036 they cant talk about their diagnosis in the school because they can be kicked out they cant talk about it in their communities with their neighbours
1270037 i dont think a rescue mission would be possible today
1270038 the weather is still bad flying in skardu and beyond was not possible this morning normally it takes two or three days to improve the weather in the area
1270039 our helicopters are ready waiting for an improvement in the situation they may try to make an attempt this evening if the weather improves even for a few hours
1270040 such missions are quick it may not take more than one or two hours to bring the climber down
1270041 they were far from me hours away but they were not turning around
1270042 but then i thought they know what they are doing
1270043 after considerable discussion by the board in executive session weve come to the agreement that at this time were not interested in the sale of those northern systems in question
1270044 without any cost benefit analysis without any figures i thought this was totally inappropriate on the part of the general manager and mr villarreal to consider any offers or any discussion without full exposure or full disclosure to the entire board
1270045 certainly we are strapped for some cash but were not going to sell our cash cow
1270046 our northern service areas are the ones that bring in the majority of our revenue for too long i think the residents of the south side of san antonio and our customers to the south and southwest have been carrying the burden of the district and it certainly would not be in their best interest to entertain the sale or transfer of those areas at this time
1270047 that is one of the presumptions that they may have been offered money to bring the items in

1270061 unfortunately poor minority and low achieving students are far more likely to be taught by an under qualified teacher than their more affluent white and high achieving peers
1270062 otherwise we will continue to have the inequity its not going to go away
1270063 how to make your teachers quit they would look at what the state of texas does
1270064 we place brand new teachers in very hard to teach schools we dont have strong mentoring programs and they get very frustrated

1270071 theres a lot of people participating already in diving and with the olympics coming theres going to be of course a lot of interest in the sport
1270072 our numbers for learn to dive usually i wouldnt say double but certainly go up i would say maybe 30 to 40 per cent
1270073 the body regions that were most injured were the head and neck along with injuries to the face this accounts for about 60 per cent of all the diving related injuries
1270074 and specifically the types of injuries that we saw were lacerations soft tissue injuries were the most common diagnoses followed by strains and sprains and fractures
1270075 about 77 per cent were forward facing about 22 per cent were backward
1270076 more than 80 per cent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to a metre so thats not very high
1270077 about 17 per cent were injured at a dive height of greater than one metre
1270078 once i slipped off the board i wasnt doing a dive i was just not paying attention and it was very early in the morning i scraped my shin but that was about it
1270079 if youre going to a country club pool or a recreational type pool or a backyard pool youre not going to have the same kind of safety that you would have at a training centre that is teaching the sport competitively

1270090 weve had to put a cap on enrolment and we have 11 portables
1270091 to be honest a 10 week vacation is a very long time this way my daughter had just a few weeks between grade 3 and grade 4 which is long enough to feel like a holiday but not so long you forget what you learned
1270092 its also flexible for family holidays to have more opportunities to travel not just one week when every other family is doing the same thing
1270093 weve deferred moving forward in large part because of our budget considerations and we will reconsider it in a years time
1270094 the board hasnt really given it a lot of consideration because it would involve a lot of collective agreement issues and we would be talking closely with cupe and the teachers federation
1270095 from a practical standpoint many of our schools dont have any air conditioning and the schools in the summertime when its really hot can be unbearable
1270096 its just amazing when you go to buy those things how they add up
1270097 the mom went back to new orleans and left the four little kids with the stepfather and because his only income was social security we had to scramble to get them things to get ready for school
1270098 everything from scissors and glue to backpacks and calculators we need all of it
1270099 we probably get more supplies for kids that are in the elementary grades because its more fun to buy for those kids but we desperately need binders and protractors we need supplies for high school students

1270102 by providing a patriotic and contemplative context for the minute of silence senate bill 83 plainly serves secular rather than religious purposes

1270149 the evora is the biggest milestone lotus has achieved since the elise was born 13 years ago and is part of our bold five year strategic plan which includes the introduction of new cars and technologies to many more markets around the world the evora also represents lotus core values of performance through light weight and efficiency and proves that you can have phenomenal performance fuel efficiency elegant design and practicality all in a class leading mid engine 2 2 sports car which will meet global safety and homologation standards
1270150 looking to the future we will continue to research develop and produce lighter more efficient vehicles which are linked to our extensive and well regarded work on all aspects of future fuels alternative engines and electric and hybrid vehicle solutions for the future we all have an environmental responsibility to future generations and the evora is another example where lotus is seen to make significant steps towards improving the efficiency and sustainability of the motorcar keeping britain at the forefront of the high technology motor industry
1270151 a cornerstone of the designs success was working closely with the technical team to develop a package that allowed us to get the proportions correct
1270152 the asymmetric wheel sizes the short rear overhang long front overhang and cab forward visor screen all contribute to giving the car visual movement and an agile stance this is incredibly important to us because we want the cars aesthetics to communicate its driving characteristics
1270153 we never lost sight of the fact that although this car must provide real world useability sports cars are emotional purchases and you have to seduce the customer through beguiling looks and exotic persona we are therefore very proud that we have been able to use technical and user functionality to positively drive the design in key areas and create some of the cars most distinctive features
1270154 ingress and egress for example dictated a minimal step over to get into the evora we simply cut away the surface under the door and created a unique and dramatic piece of sculpture that enhances the stance of the car as well as its useability
1270155 we believe that our designs should be honest as well as dramatic and so we are really pleased with the fact that these iconic features all do a real job
1270156 overall the design language shows a clear dna link with its lotus siblings whilst establishing its own distinctive and contemporary theme the undulating shoulder line is brilliantly mirrored in the lower part of the bodyside by the cutaway sill that creates a torso like muscularity
1270157 your eye is drawn effortlessly from our signature mouth rearward by fluid surfaces and fast lines that create a sense of speed even when the car is stationary from this angle you can also see how dramatically the visor screen sweeps around the teardrop form of the cabin and the gently waisted plan shape perfectly accentuates the muscularity of the rear fender this is unmistakeably mid engined language and the evora is unmistakeably a lotus
1270158 a huge departure from what people might expect based on lotus recent past we wanted evoras cabin to feel special and to be surprising as well as sporty precision engineered metal inserts and quality edge lit switches are brilliantly juxtaposed against soft hand stitched leather surfaces to give a modern interior with a classic twist
1270159 the flat bottomed steering wheel figure hugging sports seat contemporary instrumentation and ergonomically positioned controls provide an intuitive environment that instantly forms a connection between driver and car ensuring that it becomes an extension of his or her body
1270160 tactile quality is incredibly important within this segment and so we wanted the interior to use honest premium materials much of the switchgear is bespoke and every metallic component is actually metal
1270161 this year lotus celebrates its 60th anniversary and it is fitting that 2008 is also the birth of the lotus evora a fantastic addition to the lotus range
1270162 with a starting price of just 21 990 the addition of an entry level sx4 awd will significantly strengthen the line up and make all wheel drive even more affordable to lifestyle hungry consumers
1270163 a true cross over it offers customers the ideal vehicle to pursue an active lifestyle but with the economy and practicality of a small car
1270164 the new model sx4 awd represents excellent value for money in the small car segment no other vehicle comes close to matching its combination of practicality and all wheel drive performance
1270165 as with all audi s models the new tts will be the sporty top model in its family it not only looks more aggressive and dynamic its performance is second to none and continues the success story of the brand which focuses on reducing consumption whilst maintaining performance
1270166 the new audi tt is not only bigger and bolder it is also lighter and more efficient the audi tt is a sportscar you can drive without regret

1270177 the d40 navara dual cab has been a very big seller for nissan australia since its launch here and is often in the top ten of all models in according to vfacts
1270178 we see the king cab models entering a growing market segment where the need to balance a large load with the ability to carry four in safety and comfort if only occasionally will be greatly appreciated by our customers
1270179 the navara king cab will have a broad appeal from working tradesmen to people with active lifestyles who need to transport bulky gear in rougher terrain increasingly customers want to be able to use their vehicle at the weekends as much as during the week our customers love how their navara drives and they dont want to leave it behind when the work day is done
1270180 we also believe that the availability of an automatic transmission across the king cab rage will appeal to many of our customers this gives us a distinct advantage against our competitors
1270181 many navara customers have something big to tow and with a 4x4 class topping 403nm torque and a 3000kg towing capacity equaling class best across the range that should be no problem

1270258 but were seeing a big breakthrough with wall e and kung fu panda two recent successful animated movies audiences at large are just going and adults are enjoying it kids are enjoying it and i think star wars has always been part of that

1270306 wat een oud sf idee is het interpreteren van hersensignalen wordt in snel tempo realiteit de hersenen zijn namelijk altijd bezig en produceren daarbij veel chaotisch klinkend geluid we zijn nu zo ver dat we daaruit de signalen kunnen isoleren die nuttig zijn
1270307 was lucid conscious he was talking joking with some of the rescue workers at one point

1270319 we komen er niet omheen eerdere maatregelen tegen hondenpoep hebben onvoldoende geholpen
1270320 hoewel pati nten beter worden als ze antidepressiva nemen worden ze k beter als ze een placebo slikken dit betekent dat depressieve mensen zonder chemische behandeling beter kunnen worden
1270321 blonde vrouwen kunnen zorgen dat mannen zich dommer voordoen omdat ze onbewust het stereotype van het domme blondje imiteren en zich daaraan aanpassen het is duidelijk dat wanneer mensen worden geconfronteerd met stereotypes ze zich daaraan aanpassen
1270322 de toename van het testen van voedsel op dieren dit allemaal om lucratieve supervoeding te ontwikkelen is een verborgen schandaal de mensen zijn zich niet bewust van het dierenleed dat hierdoor wordt veroorzaakt
1270323 proeven met voeding nodig zijn om aan de regelgeving terzake te beantwoorden
1270324 de mutatie die verantwoordelijk is voor onze blauwe ogen deed zich vrijwel zeker voor in het noordwesten van de streek rond de zwarte zee
1270325 in oorsprong is bruin de kleur van onze ogen wat veroorzaakt wordt door de concentratie van het donkere huidpigment melanine maar in het noorden van europa deed zich een mutatie voor in een gen dat oca2 werd genoemd daardoor werd er in sommige chromosomen een knop omgedraaid die de melanine afstopte en de mogelijkheid tot bruine ogen afsloot hieruit kunnen we afleiden dat mensen met blauwe ogen dezelfde voorvader hebben want bij hen zit dezelfde knop op precies dezelfde plaats in hun dna er is wat dit betreft geen enkel verschil tussen mannen en vrouwen

1270332 most of these companies are at a stage of their growth where they may wish to expand further or move into new areas and explore the opportunities to divest some of their investment for retirement
1270333 at the same time this seminar is to clear any misunderstanding and general assumptions associated with capital raising in the capital markets and listing on the stock exchange
1270334 this process must commence in earnest in 2009 with appropriate budgetary allocations being provided to relevant bodies identified in the sne report to be responsible for the implementation of specific programmes

1270336 in consequence it has become the dominant investor in government bonds thereby stifling market development the issue therefore is whether fiji is now at a point where the absence of a deeper bond market has become a constraint on the further growth of the financial sector
1270337 investing offshore exchange controls will have to be relaxed as had been done in the past however since late 2006 the offshore investments of fnpf have been recalled in order to bolster the countrys foreign exchange reserves
1270338 the balance between offshore and local investments in the future will have to be carefully considered given that fnpf liabilities are all in fiji dollars but its assets overseas will be subject to foreign exchange rate risk
1270339 pension rates are being reduced from 25 per cent to the current level of 16 per cent this year and 15 per cent next year the rate may need to be reduced even further in future to ensure the sustainability of the fund and this should be a concern for the national council

1270347 upgrade the lives of the people of the western region to the same level as others across the uae
1270348 deferring the academic year to follow the holy month of ramadan can harm students who will bear negative consequences of adjourning or defect in calendar system
1270349 put the interest of students on the top among others preserving international standard attained by the uae in regard to teaching days which benefit the student achieving balance between first and second terms and creating balance with the evaluation of higher education institutions
1270350 the teaching plan is linked with curriculum as per class and level the ministry cannot allow adjourning of academic year to replace it with intensifying teaching or reducing curriculum or extending the academic year to compensate the deferment period
1270351 the planned interchanges will drastically increase the connectivity and provide faster more convenient access for surrounding communities that will be looking at emirates road as dubais centre for entertainment
1270352 there will be a huge interchange that should allow everything to run smoothly

1270354 the two sides of the development must be connected or everyone living and working there is going to have a huge problem

1270362 the guys and girls that come to kalgoorlie to study at the school of mines actually have a better stickiness to the industry
1270363 they stay in the industry longer than say guys who are trained in perth because they often go and work in a mining town after they get a graduate degree and think its not their kettle of fish
1270364 lets say for every two geologists that you get out of perth maybe one of them sticks in the industry for 10 years but for kalgoorlie out of every two graduates maybe one and a half or two remain in the industry for that long
1270365 the additional cost for training a geologist in kalgoorlie is inconsequential when you consider what value we can add
1270366 it appears cheaper in perth but overwhelmingly kalgoorlie grads are the ones that last
1270367 if you cant live here youll never survive in the industry
1270368 we have a digger attitude here its about making things happen
1270369 i dont understand it susans always been so good at her job

1270375 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues
1270376 im not so far into it i dont feel i need to be hands on into it
1270377 im giving the maximum donation to obama then it might have been hypocritical this wasnt an announcement it was a reporter doing his job and kpd i think you are simply looking for an argument if you believe that article was in any way slanted towards either of the candidates
1270378 barack obama is the kindest bravest warmest most wonderful human being ive ever known in my life
1270379 boy he can put up a triple double at will im going to vote the way he votes
1270380 as a washington wizards fan theres no way ill ever vote for anyone that lbj would consider
1270381 i believe that politics and sports shouldnt mix and it is best for the politicians to work out these types of issues but if sports can create awareness and shed light on this issue then thats a good thing
1270382 i didnt sign the letter right then and there so now its blown up
1270383 no one heard my side of the story but automatically its lebron didnt sign the letter he doesnt care but for me to try to create awareness of the situation thats going on in darfur and other places for me in the position i am i should speak on it and i am gonna speak on it

1270417 this strong performance reflects the companys success in redeeming loans in the first half of the year
1270418 these actions to be taken to improve the regulatory capital position of the company will not change the governments net cash exposure to northern rock
1270419 we continue to envisage that the government loan facilities will be repaid before the end of 2010

1270520 zur zeit ist eines der gr ten risiken dass die gegenw rtig ausgeschlossenen irgendwann geh r finden und ihren einfluss dann auf nationaler ebene wieder geltend machen daraus entsteht sowohl f r globale unternehmen als auch f r investoren eine herausforderung wie sch tzt man globale unternehmensstrukturen in einer zeit wo sich das l nderrisiko im weitesten sinne versch rft unternehmen m ssen sich gegen politische und soziale unruhen in den nationalstaaten sichern
1270521 der postmoderne imperialismus hat zwei komponenten die erste ist der freiwillige imperialismus der globalen konomie er wird normalerweise von einem internationalen konsortium durch internationale finanzinstitutionen wie iwf und weltbank ausge bt die zweite dimension des postmodernen imperialismus k nnte der imperialismus des nachbarn genannt werden instabilit t in der nachbarschaft stellt eine gefahr dar die kein staat ignorieren kann politische misswirtschaft ethnische gewalt und kriminalit t auf dem balkan stellen eine gefahr f r europa dar die antwort hierauf war eine art freiwilliges un protektorat im kosovo und in bosnien zu schaffen
1270522 freiwilligen imperialismus der glbalen konomie aus verst ndlichen gr nden nicht teilen
1270523 die herausforderung der postmodernen welt ist es mit der idee doppelter standards klarzukommen unter uns gehen wir auf der basis von gesetzen und offener kooperativer sicherheit um aber wenn es um traditionellere staaten au erhalb des postmodernen kontinents europa geht m ssen wir auf die raueren methoden einer vergangenen ra zur ckgreifen gewalt pr ventive angriffe irref hrung was auch immer n tig ist um mit denen klarzukommen die immer noch im 19 jahrhundert leben in dem jeder staat f r sich selber stand unter uns halten wir uns an das gesetz aber wenn wir im dschungel operieren m ssen wir ebenfalls das gesetz des dschungels anwenden

1270526 our research suggests that higher protein diets help people better control their appetites and calorie intake

1270528 we are very pleased with the response that we have received from personal finance bloggers the is the first ever credit card survey done among bloggers who write about personal finance we found out that 76 had no credit card debt and 70 had credit scores of above 700 and we think consumers can learn a few things from these bloggers

1270530 companies that operate in competitive environments know that they need to market in order to generate new business but for far too long it has been nearly impossible to accurately measure the return on those investments
1270531 with flexphone plus companies know exactly where each new customer comes from allowing them to focus their limited marketing resources on successful marketing techniques not waste money on things that dont bring results
1270532 a doctor who participated in our beta test discovered that the customer service tips she had taught her staff were not being used

1270541 do you know your company s most powerful provocative messages the positioning statement four to six key messages creates the foundation of marketing strategy the first building blocks of successful sales it lets people know in a compelling way what you do and how they can benefit from working with or buying from you
1270542 when i give a speech i tell people who introduce me to say lenann helps people figure out how to make more money
1270543 dont start the positioning process by thinking gee what would make a great message instead start thinking in detail about who you are trying to reach with the message
1270544 knowing whom you want to reach and how they think about services or products like yours should always be the first step in developing your message
1270545 most people dont know what their companys most powerful provocative messages even are
1270546 they say they do but when i ask the entire management team of a company to write down the few messages they are trying to get their prospects to believe i get as many different answers as there are people in the room
1270547 sit down with your company s leadership team and ask them to write down the main message we want our prospects to believe about us
1270548 look at the answers if you try to say everything youll end up saying nothing reduce the messages to four to six provocative points about what makes the company different better or interesting
1270549 these few messages in your positioning statement form the core of what goes on your website in your collateral materials your advertising and your sales conversations when youre with a prospect who refuses to talk about herself and instead demands why should i be interested in
1270550 if a prospect is forthcoming talking about the pain they have in areas where your service or product relieves pain abandon your positioning statement and talk instead about their pain and how you may be able to help
1270551 no matter what we say there are going to be people out there being cynical and calling it

1270660 a black and white slow motion close up shot of mr robb serves as background for reproductions of newspaper articles a playboy cover and a list of four robb acquaintances convicted of drug charges

1270665 claims of ethnic cleaning are unfounded yes the chinese government has handled the international pr situation horribly but tibet is and has always been part of china in fact this is true the chinese government has made many efforts to protect tibetan culture through architecture and state bureaucracy etc because they know that tibetan culture drives the tourist dollar they spend far more money building infrastructure in tibet than they get back from tibet westerners have been very insensitive to the chinese over the issue just because chinese people are entrepreneurial doesnt mean the government wants to destroy tibetan culture it is true that the chinese government subsidises migration there but it is building a better tibet cnn cropping photos and creating stories is disgraceful and an affront to their supposed line of work

1270704 hospitals have been quietly accumulating physician practices over the past few years as a group hospitals now employ a sizeable portion of the physician workforce
1270705 area hospitals bought primary care practices in the early 1990s as a managed care defensive strategy to lock in referrals
1270706 with deep pockets anyone can play in the physician employment market today but given physician manpower shortages to effectively compete for productive physicians hospitals will need to provide productive and professionally satisfying practices while meeting the lifestyle demands that physicians want today

1270722 the tancs system has shown extraordinary results in laboratory tests a 99 9999 reduction of mrsa and vre on surfaces within 5 seconds is a level of performance that chemical disinfectants may never achieve
1270723 for the mrsa and vre experiments tens of millions of viable cells in a 5 artificial soil suspension were spread over porous clay surfaces
1270724 at least 6 million viable mrsa or vre cells were present on each test surface after the inoculum was dried creating a film the surfaces were then treated briefly with the saturated steam device for periods of 0 5 1 2 and 5 seconds immediately after treatment test surfaces were transferred to a broth suspension for cooling and microbial enumeration by duplicate plating the experiment was designed to detect even a single surviving microorganism after treatment with the tancs steam vapor
1270725 the saturated steam device tested here produced an extraordinary reduction of both mrsa and vre
1270726 the two separate replicates of each experiment produced very similar kill curves suggesting that these results were not anomalous

1270772 a wide range of challenges which have to addressed in order to fully exploit the benefits offered
1270773 improvements are needed in how the information is processed and disseminated
1270774 the mod was perhaps slow to appreciate the potential of uavs but now recognises the important contribution they can make
1270775 the uavs acquired for current operations are proving very effective in collecting istar information however improvements are required in how this information is processed and disseminated
1270776 the mod must push forward with its planned improvements so that our armed forces can continue to achieve information superiority over the enemy
1270777 unmanned aerial vehicles are giving our forces the vital information they need to stay one step ahead of the enemy
1270778 whether it be targeting taliban or supporting troops on patrol their ability to feed back images and videos in real time loiter over and survey an area for enemy activity means they are an invaluable asset for our ground commanders
1270779 they have a crucial role to play in future operations and we will continue to invest in them
1270780 this is something we can do on an interim basis as much as possible to protect our children
1270781 there has to be a stronger vehicle for cities and towns to protect children

1270786 the supreme victory of faith over the apparent reality of things
1270787 the proving of things not seen the assurance of things hoped for
1270788 i talked with my colleagues from sweden and finland we think the current president of the european union and the european commission should closely follow the developments and react if necessary
1270789 peacekeeping in these regions is a suitable undertaking for the european union
1270790 actions are being undertaken to create an illusion of large scale armed conflict as if we were on the brink of war the russian foreign ministry is obviously orchestrating and facilitating this process
1270791 all this is being done to derail the peace process in which the international community is becoming increasingly involved
1270792 as in previous years moscow deems the month of august propitious for staging military incidents in georgia while european officials take their vacations
1270793 but at the same time if there is a request if there is an interest i believe that the european union given the importance that we pay to georgia and to this region would be willing to consider making a contribution
1270794 we need to reestablish positions on cuba and in other countries
1270795 the phone conversation has not been conclusive we do not exclude new contacts in the coming days
1270796 this is not a militarisation of cities but a clear response to the perceived demand for greater security

1270811 variance swaps are a pure play in a space where we already have years of experience they offer a way to capture the excess volatility risk premium which is generated by the hedging activity of the large number of investors who are long equities
1270812 this overestimation in fact averages almost 33 a month and is something we have taken advantage of in our index option selling programs
1270813 interestingly while there can be no assurance of future results our backtesting shows that some of the best performance from this program comes during large drops in the equity markets
1270814 allens breadth of experience in alternative investments with both major financial institutions as well as private investment firms complements the deep knowledge base of our research team
1270815 we are dedicated to maintaining a world class research team under allens expert leadership to accomplish our mission of providing high quality alternative investments to wealth managers and high net worth investors

1270818 the credit union loan offers a fixed stable rate of interest a simple interest accrual method a low origination fee of 1 no mortgage insurance and no monthly service fees
1270819 secu investigated the reverse mortgage marketplace and we saw numerous opportunities to provide this important product to our members reducing the typical costs being assessed through reduced fees a fixed rate of interest and a simple interest accrual method we will provide the member with an enhanced use of their equity this will result in more funds being made available to the member in order to assist with their day to day living expenses the features of the secu reverse mortgage are very consistent with our do the right thing philosophy
1270820 a reverse mortgage can be a useful financial option for some older homeowners who need to supplement their retirement income to help pay for essential needs since each homeowners situation is unique and reverse mortgages differ significantly in payment options and fees it is important to receive face to face counseling with a certified reverse mortgage counselor prior to applying for a loan certified reverse mortgage counselors in north carolina are trained to provide consumers with information on reverse mortgage products and other services available to older adults that will help them make informed financial decisions
1270821 if you are considering a reverse mortgage you should shop around and talk to a counselor to make sure you are getting the product that is right for you reverse mortgages are complex products and choosing the wrong one can cost you thousands of dollars and even possibly your home

1270843 we only need to fluoridate 40 per cent of the country greater manchester is currently considering it and there are many other areas that are looking at it
1270844 a total of 170 million people in america drink fluoridated water and it is the most litigious country in the world
1270845 this medication is carried out by water companies without the individual consent of their customers
1270846 fluoridation should cease immediately as it violates the right to refuse consent to a medical intervention
1270847 the governments 2005 oral health strategy for england advises the nhs to consider introducing water fluoridation in areas with poor oral health and where local communities support it
1270848 fluoridation is extremely important in this country in preventing dental decay as we have quite poor eating and dental care habits if we did not have fluoridated water we would be at eastern european levels of dental decay
1270849 twenty years ago tooth brushing in the uk was at the same level as our 15 year olds are at today there is certainly something in the culture that we are not addressing specifically
1270850 the risk of fluoridation is that if too much is taken in children under the age of three years as teeth are being formed it can cause fluorosis fluorosis is actually caused by young children swallowing the water although our brushing habits are not good enough yet many parents particularly middle class parents are starting to brush their childrens teeth at a young age
1270851 perhaps at the end of the day there was too much information and the methven people got sick of it in the end i honestly believe they had had too much
1270852 for three or four weeks in snowfed methvens paper two or three pages in the middle of it were put in or authorised by don church and the first one you thought thats ok then the next week it had as much again and the next week it came out with a similar lot again by then people were saying i wish hed take a hike
1270853 i wanted to listen to the health professionals who trained in new zealand
1270854 thats who i wanted to listen to not some professor or someone doing a thesis or something somewhere else in the world
1270855 im happy that it is an endorsement of common sense
1270856 a number of local people worked very hard to help achieve this result for their community
1270857 methven and burnham military camp have the only fluoridated water supplies in canterbury
1270858 people in the rest of canterbury have worse teeth because the water doesnt have enough fluoride to protect them

1270866 polls may be saying that women in their 40s and 50s will be the new swing vote in the 2008 presidential election but the silent generation women could be the stealth vote that puts the title of president in front of senator mccain instead of senator obama
1270867 they think of themselves as 10 to15 years younger than their chronological age
1270868 so a presidents age is not an issue to the silent generation
1270869 they had super heroes for role models and deeply competent public figures like president franklin roosevelt and general dwight eisenhower silents want to know that they are voting for the most qualified candidate
1270870 gratuitous comments about senator clintons hair styles wrinkles cleavage and pant suits diverted from the seriousness of her political message
1270871 the silent generation of women the hidden electorate that could determine who will be the next president of the u s may turn to mccain not only for their generational values but also because they feel that neither candidate obama the democratic party nor the media gave the first serious female presidential candidate a fair shake

1270878 the complexity and lack of flexibility of traditional knowledge sharing solutions are driving the interest in solutions that are easy to use and that adapt to an organizations needs
1270879 we have seen significant demand from clients who want to adopt web 2 0 technologies but who want to work with an enterprise class product and a company with experience in making these technologies work in a business environment
1270880 the first generation of e commerce software still prevalent in todays market was based on the traditional proprietary software model
1270881 this is software created by a staff of developers that is sold for hundreds or thousands of dollars and often requires monthly payments
1270882 prestashop on the other hand is a committed member of the open source software movement
1270883 and like other open source e commerce applications such as oscommerce prestashop is free its license ols 3 0 is one of the least restrictive and users arent even required to register first
1270884 businesses love prestashop because its easy to manage their online stores
1270885 customers love prestashop because its smooth web 2 0 interface is pleasant to shop on and software developers love prestashop because its easy to integrate and because the user community is very active and helpful for example prestashop users have already translated prestashop into over 20 different languages and its only at version 1 0
1270886 despite such a clear demonstration of the power of integrating search and offline channels
1270887 surprisingly the strategy has yet to gain widespread adoption unfortunately by failing to integrate their efforts with offline search marketers are essentially ignoring the very channels that drive users to search obviously there is a big disconnect between search marketing strategy and search engine user behavior
1270888 theres no question about the combined power of search and offline channels that is well established
1270889 whats missing from this equation is the right environment to truly push integration forward and fully reap its benefits it is incumbent upon the cmo to break down the silos eliminate the obstacles that plague its progress and create a culture that rewards integrated efforts
1270890 while search marketers are diversifying their digital content portfolios with videos press releases and images to remain competitive in the blended search landscape
1270891 their lack of alignment with user behavior suggests that they are missing the mark again this speaks to the big disconnect between search marketer strategy and search engine user behavior to fully capitalize on their efforts search marketers need to take user behavior into consideration at all times
1270892 kiddesktop is a fun and interactive solution for children that teaches the ins and outs of working on the computer safely and exploring the web without the worry of harmful content

1270927 there are four questions of value in life what is sacred of what is the spirit made what is worth living for and what is worth dying for the answer to each is the same only love
1270928 eventually you will come to understand that love heals everything and love is all there is
1270929 if my mind can conceive it and my heart can believe it i know i can achieve it
1270930 love is the condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own
1270931 love doesnt make the world go round love is what makes the ride worthwhile
1270932 love wasnt put in your heart to stay love isnt love until you give it away
1270933 dont ask what the world needs ask what makes you come alive and go do it because what the world needs is people who have come alive
1270934 peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek but a means by which we arrive at that goal
1270935 love isnt finding a perfect person its seeing an imperfect person perfectly
1270936 we waste time looking for the perfect lover instead of creating the perfect love
1270937 you never lose by loving you always lose by holding back

1270942 we do not have to visit a madhouse to find disordered minds our planet is the mental institution of the universe

1270948 if you cant explain it simply you dont understand it well enough
1270949 the really unhappy person is the one who leaves undone what they can do and starts doing what they dont understand no wonder they come to grief
1270950 it has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity

1271035 be careful you have to hold the phone just like this so you dont lose the connection
1271036 the surprise is that the audiences that turn up are for the most part young
1271037 theyre sprinkled with fans who obviously knew the band back in the day but its mostly young people who are very excitable and receiving the music very enthusiastically thats been a big surprise for me i didnt know what to expect
1271038 you go into a room where the average age is 45 to 65 and you see guys jumping up like theyre 19 or 20 we put the music together and we didnt realize until we got on the stage that all our fans had aged with us
1271039 playing all kinds of music but mostly on the edge very improvised kind of wild music but toward the end i was really wanting to experience getting grooving rhythms and lyrical melodies across to an audience i became more interested in how to reach an audience with music so that was the basic intent of return to forever to take everything i knew with music and put it in a form that could reach out to a lot of people
1271040 its hard to say specifically what comes out of what
1271041 but one thing that came about through studying the works of hubbard was a rediscovery of the importance of communication in life in general so i started to apply that kind of realization that i had to music
1271042 its like anything where two guys just start out doing something together
1271043 its like two guys who open up a restaurant or open up a shoe store when we started out chick had maybe 10 cents in his pocket and i probably had 15 we just went for it and that was it
1271044 a lot of life went down during those years and a lot of changes
1271045 a lot of growing i think too it came to a point where each guy was thinking more toward doing his own music i actually encouraged that to happen because it was a natural thing
1271046 weve been talking about it for years whenever we cross paths or join each other on a project the subject of the band always comes up but everyone has developed a pretty active if not intense career so its just that the discussions about putting it together got a little bit more intense over the past couple of years and we decided to just get down to brass tacks and carve out a schedule
1271047 everyone is much wiser not to say that the adolescent quality that we all love in music from young people is bad but were older and we still have a lot of passion i actually think the band is much more soulful now than it ever was
1271048 chick said a really cool thing to me the other night he said i have to finally admit it return to forever is the most successful powerful thing ive done in my entire career and i actually agree with him in my own life its probably the most significant musical adventure that ive had
1271049 nobody in the industry or the press singled him out as a major talent on the strength of the first 26 features all of them company assignments

1271077 ill bet they wonder about this crazy bookstore seems like a front for something else mafia or spies
1271078 look whos talking you run up and down the street carrying that sack like a smuggler and then walk in here with a huge knife to hold me up and now you wonder if im the criminal well as the village priest says things are never what they seem
1271079 while im here i might as well take a look at your books maybe youll lend me some too
1271080 i never did get around to those thrillers about angels and demons and the da vinci book that everybody is reading
1271081 thank god my boy you did well look at that sign

1271146 one of the things i like about the fact that cds dont sell so much anymore
1271147 is that the whole idea of making music to be played on the radio seems so ridiculous i used to do that a lot but now i think it gives musicians the freedom to forget about radio to go out and just play something and record something one of my friends said stanley youre sick to think like this but whatever

1271195 se ha hablado mucho al respecto y la forma en que se genera un llamado a un naturalizado es porque tiene todos los derechos para jugar el nico l mite es la calidad del jugador son once los futbolistas que pueden estar en una cancha y entran a jugar los mejores los que decide el t cnico la calidad es el nico l mite que puede existir los lugares se ganan las oportunidades se buscan y los que representen a m xico ser n los once mejores esa decisi n es una responsabilidad del t cnico pero creo que son muchos m s los naturalizados elegibles en su momento estuvieron unos hoy est n otros y puede haber otros reitero que el nico l mite es la calidad del futbolista si tiene la capacidad puede estar
1271196 en la selecci n como en los equipos los lugares se ganan y esa competencia es el l mite
1271197 ese riesgo ha existido desde hace muchos a os pero la calidad ser la mejor regla por m s que te naturalices por querer jugar con la selecci n
1271198 para m como dije la ltima vez es algo muy sencillo si tienen pasaporte mexicano no tengo problema
1271199 s es cierto que existe pol mica ac en m xico pero yo voy a trabajar con estos que tengo y que s que pueden dar cosas a la selecci n yo convoco por los m ritos por la entrega por la fuerza y no por otras cosas
1271200 si tienen el pasaporte mexicano es simple existen selecciones en el mundo que juegan con naturalizados en suecia hay muchos naturalizados personas de color que incluso ayudan a las selecciones a m me parece muy bien incluso ahora en los juegos ol mpicos suecia quiere ganar una medalla de oro en china con un naturalizado
1271201 todos los naturalizados tienen los mismos derechos que un mexicano de nacimiento el pasaporte lo da la constituci n no la federaci n lo nico que prometo es que no voy a pedir que la fmf naturalice a un jugador eso nunca lo har a

1271211 llego con el objetivo de ganarme un lugar la motivaci n no es s lo trabajar con la selecci n y listo no yo pienso en ganarme un lugar
1271212 las cr ticas siempre estar n yo lo que tengo que hacer es aportar y trabajar fuerte adaptarme a la idea de lo que pretenda el entrenador y dejar lo que se diga afuera de la cancha
1271213 no tengo duda de que si me hubieran puesto la playera de brasil y la de m xico al mismo tiempo hubiera escogido por supuesto la de m xico le debo todo a m xico no s lo como jugador y principalmente a los pumas
1271214 sobre el himno nacional no te voy a decir que me lo s completo pero la realidad es que ah voy
1271215 tratar de devolver un poco de la confianza que me han dado en tanto tiempo que he estado aqu
1271216 cuando no estuve lo que pens fue en seguir en el trabajo lo primero siempre es mi equipo si las cosas van bien ah se podr a dar la oportunidad de ganarme el lugar de nueva cuenta ya se dio y qu bueno me siento feliz
1271217 me siento feliz m s por mis hijos que son de aqu adem s este pa s me ha dado de todo y quiero retribu rselo con mucho esfuerzo y humildad
1271218 m xico me ha dado mucho mi carrera futbol stica la he hecho aqu salvo dos a os que jugu en argentina y uno m s en inglaterra me hice aqu como el profesional que soy ahora y contestando a la pregunta s habr a optado por m xico
1271219 lo que pasa es que para el nuevo t cnico eso no es un problema llamar a naturalizados porque en europa se usa y no hay tantas preguntas al respecto
1271220 imag nate que en un partido equis dentro de los 11 haya cuatro naturalizados va a estar un poquito dif cil aceptarlo
1271221 creo que es un tema que pasa por el gusto de cada quien y la necesidad del entrenador el caso de guille fue un poco m s complicado que el m o o el de sinha porque existe gente que estuvo de acuerdo y gente que no la posici n de atacante siempre es m s pol mica muchos dijeron que el guille no era necesario que hab a gente en el ataque para ocupar ese lugar la historia ya se escribi y es un hecho que guille sigue siendo un referente en el equipo nacional
1271222 se siente siempre y no s lo en el deporte te puedo decir que es en la vida cotidiana el ser convocado a la selecci n es producto del trabajo en tu club seas naturalizado o mexicano como se dice claro que por ser extranjero o no nacido en el pa s se pueden crear otras expectativas
1271223 depende de cada persona el cari o que le puedas tener al pa s por el que te naturalizas es grande para tomar esa determinaci n y claro que tampoco olvidas el cari o por tu pa s de origen yo me considero un mexicano m s y el haber jugado en la selecci n es como devolverle un poco de ese cari o que el pa s me ha dado
1271224 es un tema de mucha pol mica en m xico y creo que mis compa eros naturalizados y yo estamos conscientes de ello sabemos todo lo que se genera alrededor de este tema la gente que nos apoya se los agradezco de coraz n y a la que no est de acuerdo con nuestra incursi n en la selecci n la respeto
1271225 fue incre ble cr eme que el simple hecho de recordarlo me enchina la piel fue un orgullo para m el ser convocado el estar ah el vestir la playera de la selecci n de m xico es un orgullo muy grande y uno como delantero siempre quiere dar m s hacer goles aportar para que el equipo obtenga buenos resultados
1271226 es cierto que hay mucha presi n para nosotros naturalizados pero en el interior del grupo lo nico que hay es uni n todos estamos con la mente en el mismo objetivo queremos dar lo m ximo sin importar qui n naci ac en m xico y qui n no al final lo m s importante es representar a m xico
1271227 lo nico que puedo decir es gracias la confianza se gana con el trabajo no s lo la confianza de los compa eros tambi n la de los aficionados
1271228 orgullo eso es lo que representa para m soy mexicano y me siento con el compromiso de regresarle a m xico algo de lo mucho que me ha dado

1271256 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than we imagined
1271257 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1271258 to have a group of animals under such a high level of threat is quite frankly unlike anything we have recorded among any other group of species to date
1271259 among the african species the great apes such as gorillas and bonobos have always tended to grab the limelight and even though they are deeply threatened it is smaller primates such as the red colobus that could die out first
1271260 the work with lion tamarins shows that conserving forest fragments and reforesting to create corridors that connect them is not only vital for primates but offers the multiple benefits of maintaining healthy ecosystems and water supplies while reducing greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change

1271263 if you try to do everything differently youll scare the horses and under mmp its very hard to win
1271264 once we have gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1271265 we may be able to do some things we believe we need to do perhaps go through a discussion document process you wouldnt be able to do them straight off im hoping that well do some useful things that way that may not be policy right now

1271268 market conditions in the 2008 second quarter improved from the prior quarter although they remain volatile particularly given the recent concerns regarding government sponsored agencies gse with improved liquidity in the credit markets stable prepayment rates and mortgage spreads remaining wide net interest spread on the companys investment portfolio improved to 143 basis points as compared to 85 basis points in the first quarter of 2008
1271269 in response to the rapidly changing conditions that resulted from the disruption in the credit markets in march 2008 the company elected to reduce its leverage to 7 to 1 and improve its liquidity position by selling a portion of its agency mbs portfolio we believe this decision has positioned the company to better navigate existing challenges and future disruptions in the credit markets while still providing for attractive returns on the companys portfolio the company maintained a 7 to 1 leverage throughout the second quarter and will continue for the foreseeable future
1271270 identified molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of human cognitive abilities by combining biological data from two research directions evolutionary and medical
1271271 our new research suggests that schizophrenia is a by product of the increased metabolic demands brought about during human brain evolution
1271272 our brains are unique among all species in their enormous metabolic demand if we can explain how our brains sustain such a tremendous metabolic flow we will have a much better chance to understand how the brain works and why it sometimes breaks
1271273 taking a long term perspective on ecosystem services highlights tradeoffs among services and points to the level at which management actions will be effective
1271274 its important to keep these tradeoffs in mind in order to develop realistic management goals
1271275 we often wring our hands trying to figure out how to put values on ecosystem services
1271276 we hope policy makers will take notice that there are costs associated with these economic activities that havent been accounted for previously
1271277 ecosystem services projects are far more likely to engage a wider variety of stakeholders drawing in private agricultural landowners and engaging funds from sources such as private corporations

1271279 there are things you can do individually though to save energy making sure your tires are properly inflated simple things but we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tuneups youd actually save just as much
1271280 now the latest scheme is well were going to drill offshore
1271281 john mccains and george bushs proposal to drill offshore here in florida and other places around the country would not provide families with any relief this year next year or five years from now
1271282 wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
1271283 we need oil drilling and we need it now offshore

1271286 the distribution of wealth is skewed and levels of inequality are now higher than at any time since the gilded age
1271287 while the median wage and salary income of the average worker showed literally no gain the income of the top hundredth of a percent went up almost 500
1271288 what ive said is that i would look at raising the capital gains tax for purposes of fairness
1271289 if restaurateurs had their way every lawmaker would run a small business before starting to legislate
1271290 even though we are succeeding in preventing organ rejection we havent made much progress to improve long term survival
1271291 unfortunately most kidney transplant patients will go back on dialysis in eight to ten years in part because the anti rejection drugs can be toxic to the kidneys
1271292 successful low dose regimens of tacrolimus and other anti rejection medications require highly precise ultra sensitive drug monitoring assays
1271293 at low doses even the slightest variation in blood level readings could be devastating to transplant patients the consequence for the laboratory is twofold it must have accurate precise testing for immunosuppressive drugs and tacrolimus tests that are accurate to 4 ng ml are no longer adequate
1271294 the challenge for the laboratory therefore is to assure with the utmost confidence to the physician that a tacrolimus blood level of 3 ng ml is exactly right and not 5
1271295 the functional sensitivity in our hands was 0 9 ng ml exceeding the package insert claim of 2 ng ml we are fully confident the architect tacrolimus assay meets our requirement for low level tacrolimus monitoring
1271296 the architect tacrolimus assay is the only automated transplant monitoring test that meets international standards for low level monitoring
1271297 unfortunately the current testing procedure for aki a blood test to measure the ability of the kidneys to filter creatinine into the urine is unable to identify the problem in the first 48 hours when time is critical for preventing kidney failure
1271298 the incidence of this common complication has risen by 11 percent in recent years and we need better ways to diagnose and treat the condition and lower the risk of death or needing dialysis
1271299 the urine ngal marker has the potential to represent a major advance in identifying patients at risk for developing aki after surgery or trauma and in other situations commonly seen in critically ill patients
1271300 serum creatinine testing is inadequate it is a non specific marker that delays diagnosis of aki new biomarkers are needed to stimulate testing of new therapies and significantly decrease the mortality in aki and costs associated with it
1271301 rises in urine ngal levels at two hours identified 90 percent of children who later developed aki urine ngal therefore was highly predictive of aki risk and we found those with higher levels were more likely to die or need dialysis
1271302 clinically there is no comparison since ngal provides specific and rapid diagnosis of aki while creatinine blood tests are not able to distinguish aki from chronic kidney disease
1271303 from the single drop of urine we obtain essential information when time is critical to help prevent kidney failure and save lives with close monitoring the early information provided by the ngal test could make treatments more effective if started at the beginning of aki
1271304 clinical decision making and the counselling of patients relatives but it must be remembered that their outcomes apply to populations and so great caution is needed if applying them to individual patients
1271305 this sensor doesnt resemble any other light sensors previously discovered
1271306 that doesnt mean shining an ultraviolet light on people in wheelchairs will suddenly allow them to walk
1271307 but it does give us a tool that we can use to solve the mysteries of nerve cell communication and could ultimately help us understand the biology of everything from sleep and memory to depression
1271308 the new work from ken millers lab has identified a new way that organisms can sense light distinct from the previously known light sensing mechanism used in the eye
1271309 it will be interesting to see whether the lite 1 light sensing mechanism will also lead to new insights into human sensory perception
1271310 without signals from this network neurons cannot talk to each other or to muscle cells to produce movement so the mutants just lie paralyzed on the culture plate even if you poke and prod them
1271311 when you are only a few cells thick getting a sunburn is fatal
1271312 were a long way from any treatments based on this research but i think weve opened up a door that we didnt know was there before
1271313 theres a lot of work left to be done but im excited to see where this discovery leads us
1271314 our long term goal should be to alter our lifestyle accordingly beginning in infancy or early childhood
1271315 instituting a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet in infancy 7 months is perfectly safe without adverse effects
1271316 our review of the literature convinces us that more aggressive and earlier intervention will probably prevent considerably more than 30 of coronary heart disease
1271317 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1271318 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1271319 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to reeducate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like cigarette smoking can be overcome eventually
1271320 treatment guidelines recommend aggressive treatment of lipids in patients with mixed dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes
1271321 a comprehensive approach may be necessary to help these patients manage their lipids
1271322 new treatment options are critical given that a substantial number of patients are not achieving treatment goals for their three key lipids
1271323 abbott has built a robust clinical program to support trilipix to provide physicians and patients with as much data as possible to help them evaluate this potential new therapy
1271324 the new formulation center is a clear example of abbotts commitment to advancing scientific innovation
1271325 with the growing number of compounds in abbotts pipeline the new center utilizes the latest technology to accelerate the development of future medicines
1271326 we considered several locations for the new formulation center but decided to strategically place the building in the midst of our other abbott park r amp d facilities to provide easy access for our scientists pharmacists and engineers
1271327 rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic progressive disease with no cure and usually requires long term management for patients so it is reassuring that humira has demonstrated up to seven years of efficacy in patients with this disease
1271328 xience v is an important innovation that gives patients in the united states access to a next generation drug eluting stent that has been shown in clinical trials to improve patient outcomes
1271329 during the stent procedure we found it easy to deliver xience v to the diseased portion of the vessel with its combination of clinical efficacy and deliverability i believe that xience v will become a key advancement in the treatment of coronary artery disease
1271330 post approval studies allow physicians to follow the safety and efficacy of new treatments in a more complex patient population than is typically studied in pre approval clinical trials xience v usa will provide significant insight about the performance of abbotts new drug eluting stent in a variety of patients
1271331 our ability to work with our physician partners to begin this post approval study within days of fda approval is further evidence of abbotts commitment to help the interventional cardiology community gain additional insights about the clinical benefits of about xience v
1271332 there is no cure for ankylosing spondylitis and the goal of therapy is to relieve back and joint pain
1271333 even partial remission of as can have a considerable positive impact on a patients symptoms these data are reassuring for patients because they demonstrate that adalimumab can be an effective treatment for ankylosing spondylitis
1271334 we have ambitious treatment goals for the more than 2 million people living with hiv in tanzania as well as broader challenges in meeting the needs of people who require long term monitoring and care for diseases like diabetes
1271335 modern hospital laboratories are the building blocks for successful treatment and we are grateful and excited to work with abbott fund on this project
1271336 this laboratory improvement project is an important part of our continued partnership with the government of tanzania to make sustainable improvements to the health care system in tanzania
1271337 were improving the delivery of quality care for tanzanians by upgrading testing services that are critical for the prevention and treatment of diabetes heart disease hiv aids and many other conditions
1271338 the health care system improvements supported by the abbott fund will help extend u s government efforts to improve the health of the tanzanian people
1271339 the modernized laboratory at amana will serve patients seen at the new hiv care and treatment center funded by pepfar which is a clear reflection of how governments and the private sector can work together for the common good
1271340 xience v represents an important treatment advance for the estimated 13 million people in the united states suffering from coronary artery disease and we believe xience v will quickly become the new standard for drug eluting stents given its outstanding clinical results
1271341 physicians in the united states have been waiting for years to treat their patients with a technology that delivers on the promise of drug eluting stents through both ease of use and excellent clinical performance and
1271342 xience v was designed to improve safety and efficacy compared to earlier generation stents the long term clinical data from two studies performed in both the united states and europe have now confirmed that xience v is a true next generation drug eluting stent with clinically important benefits for patients
1271343 with one of the largest most seasoned vascular sales forces in the united states and with the ability to supply more than half the worldwide market we will begin shipping units of xience v immediately to meet physician demand for this much awaited next generation technology

1271349 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1271350 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1271351 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1271352 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1271353 the review paints a bleak picture some primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction but it is by no means a doomsday scenario there is a lot of will here among these scientists in edinburgh and in the countries where primates live

1271355 with one in five teenagers reporting abuse of a prescription medication to get high parents must open their eyes to the dangers of this new tier of teen substance abuse
1271356 teens and their parents have a false sense of security mistakenly believing its somehow safer to abuse prescription medication than street drugs this issue demands the immediate action of parents both by learning the facts and safeguarding medications at home as well as talking with teens about this very real threat to their health
1271357 prescription medicines have an important role in health care but they have significant risks when they are misused and abused
1271358 abbott and the partnership have developed the not in my house education initiative to help teach parents the importance of securing medications in their homes to help protect their children
1271359 i stand with magic campaign to end black hiv aids
1271360 we need real outcomes not just outputs i encourage leaders in the black community to take action get talking and take a stand in their neighborhoods
1271361 this psa was developed to educate people about this disease this campaign keeps pounding the message home more than 80 000 people have received information about the campaign through www istandwithmagic com and more than 20 000 hiv tests have been conducted as a result of abbott and the magic johnson foundations efforts to help raise awareness of this public health issue spike ddb is proud to be a part of it
1271362 we need to take it upon ourselves to bring the number of new infections down in the black communities by arming ourselves with knowledge
1271363 getting tested for hiv can be scary for many people but i hope by launching these public service announcements to at risk populations people across the country will have the courage to get tested and go back for their results
1271364 abbott and the magic johnson foundation are committed to making a difference in the fight against hiv aids by providing communities with information and resources for prevention and testing and educational materials to share with family and friends
1271365 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1271366 its not just a new face we need its new faces my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle
1271367 im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season but im not going to turn around and say i am totally confident because you never know what happens
1271368 our attempts to complete the signings of players we believe will improve the quality of our first team squad continues on an hourly basis
1271369 we have had a budget for incoming transfers since the start of the summer and that budget is in no way reliant or dependent upon either the proposed relocation of the club to kirkby or the sale of current players
1271370 fraizer did not do himself any harm against espanyol on saturday and i would not expect sir alex to say anything else at this stage
1271371 all we can do is respect manchester uniteds wishes but make sure sir alex is not in any doubt as to our interest in fraizer we will just have to bide our team and be patient
1271372 ive been impressed with him i like him very much and im pleased weve got him here hes a good kid and has the potential to become a very good player he was recommended to me and we got him here straight away because there is a big gulf at the club between senior players and young kids weve got nothing in between really but he can bridge that gap
1271373 the situation has not changed tottenham offered us 15 8m for andrei but that does not work for us we are waiting for a new proposal
1271374 it will be the usual top four but i cant see anyone getting above them
1271375 weve been saying to him all summer with the power hes got he should be striking more
1271376 the evidence is there for you now he has fantastic feet
1271377 it was a good game and a great atmosphere from the aris supporters and a worthwhile exercise for us
1271378 i thought the result was fair maybe the fact we drew flattered us a little bit as aris created the better chances

1271382 a consumer campaign like this is a godsend to a brand it tells you that there are people out there who are passionate enough to badger their friends about your product that means you have a large unpaid sales force out there banging the drum for you
1271383 the temptation is to interfere to market to those people but they dont want to be marketed to they just want the product the best thing you can do for them is to act and thats what cadbury have done by bringing the wispa back
1271384 the most long lasting brands are the ones that people bring into their lives and make an emotional connection with some brands share the characteristic all celebrities aspire to they achieve our loyal affection the feeling for wispa lived on even after the brand disappeared

1271481 the board of michael page continues to believe that the company has a very strong future as an independent group

1271485 il piano era di viaggiare a borisov con un vantaggio da difendere ma non ci siamo riusciti ha spiegato jacobs dobbiamo segnare due gol e non subirne se il bate riuscito a farlo a bruxelles e se vogliamo giocare la champions league dobbiamo vincere in bielorussia
1271486 una stagione con soltanto due gare europee difficile da immaginare per l anderlecht giocare soltanto i tornei nazionali significa avere troppi giocatori per troppe poche partite il che pu essere fonte di problemi inoltre avrebbe conseguenze negative sul piano finanziario per il club per non parlare del coefficiente uefa del calcio belga ma questo il momento dei fatti a borisov dobbiamo dare tutti il 200 e vincere con due o tre gol di scarto mercoled giocheremo per l anderlecht e per il calcio belga
1271487 aver pareggiato 1 1 in trasferta un buon risultato ma il calcio insegna a non dare nulla per scontato il calcio azero molto migliorato rispetto a dieci anni fa

1271490 putin inherited a ransacked and bewildered country with a poor and demoralized people
1271491 and he started to do what was possible a slow and gradual restoration these efforts were not noticed nor appreciated immediately in any case one is hard pressed to find examples in history when steps by one country to restore its strength were met favorably by other governments
1271492 we are proud that alexander solzhenitsyn was our compatriot and contemporary
1271493 we will remember him as a strong courageous person with a great sense of dignity his activities as a writer and public figure his entire long thorny life journey will remain for us a model of true devotion selfless service to the people motherland and the ideals of freedom justice and humaneness
1271494 worked incessantly to form moral and spiritual ideals seeing them as an extremely important foundation supporting the state and society and fought for their triumph
1271495 but he spent his last day wonderfully he worked all day writing at his desk recently he told me that now he only worked eight hours a day when before he used to work for 16 he thought it was very little seven or eight hours and he complained about it
1271496 severe trials befell solzhenitsyn as they did millions of other people in this country
1271497 he was among the first to speak out about the brutality of stalins regime and about the people who experienced it but were not crushed to his last days he continued to work for russia to get a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country not just break away from the totalitarian past we owe him much
1271498 a mass multibillion dollar fire sale of the national patrimony wanting to gain the support of regional leaders yeltsin called directly for separatism and passed laws that encouraged and empowered the collapse of the russian state this of course deprived russia of its historical role for which it had worked so hard and lowered its standing in the international community all this met with even more hearty western applause
1271499 when solzhenitsyn first appeared on the soviet literary scene it was the greatest news
1271500 no one wrote about stalins camps as he did his impact was sensational and i was one of his admirers
1271501 for me a great writer must defend mankind and he loses his reputation if he becomes too close to the highest power
1271502 solzhenitsyn said many things i radically disagree with including his comments on putin
1271503 but the meaning of solzhenitsyn is not lessened because of this
1271504 the man who restored the country the man who saved the nation and didnt allow it to turn back to totalitarianism
1271505 of course russia is not a democratic country yet it is just starting to build democracy
1271506 it is all too easy to take russia to task with a long list of omissions violations and mistakes but did not russia clearly and unambiguously stretch its helping hand to the west after 9 11 only a psychological shortcoming or else a disastrous shortsightedness can explain the wests irrational refusal of this hand
1271507 i for my part drew the writers attention to the fact that some steps we are taking today are largely in accordance with what solzhenitsyn once wrote about
1271508 trained to think that flirting with an attractive woman could destroy their relationship
1271509 formulate strategies to protect his relationship by avoiding that available attractive woman
1271510 women have been socialized to be wary of the advances of attractive men

1271513 our aim is to present church music for both catholic and orthodox churches in jordan
1271514 if we cannot hold masses together at least we can chant together
1271515 youngsters usually think that chants inside the church are boring
1271516 we have realised after listening and writing lyrics and melodies that the gregorian and the byzantine melodies currently used at ritual churches have a kind of deepness that makes you closer to god
1271517 i wish this would be the style at the church
1271518 why not they would do no wrong introducing this new style to the church
1271519 the existing style was made by too old people a long time ago and now youngsters do not like it
1271520 i do not feel that the atmosphere of latin churches permits to perform this new style
1271521 this is for people to listen to at homes and in cars for example but not in the church
1271522 i believe in the christ and his mother mary they are mentioned in the holy koran
1271523 we were two when we first started and now we are 50
1271524 alexander isayevich will remain a model of inner freedom and human dignity for his contemporaries and descendants he dared to speak with authorities of his country and of the west and with people fearlessly pointed out to lie and paid no regard for fashion or public opinion
1271525 the country will lack his words and his participation in public discussion
1271526 rich heritage of this writer and thinker will remain with us and we have to make this heritage well known and close to people primarily through school
1271527 all the other mothers at mums group all talk about hungry cries tired cries and angry cries and i am sure i wouldnt recognise one cry from another
1271528 of course you dont know these cries at an intellectual level you are so attuned to molly that you are responding to her pre cry signals so she doesnt have to work up to a full blown cry
1271529 at our mothers group talk on sleep i was told i had to leave billy to cry for increasing times i am supposed to do this for up to 45 minutes but i dont want to let him cry himself to sleep

1271540 hey you happy birthday what are your plans anything fun
1271541 it has been a tough year for the high priests of global warming in the us first nasa had to correct its earlier claim that the hottest year on record in the contiguous us had been 1998 which seemed to prove that global warming was on the march it was actually 1934 then it turned out the worlds oceans have been growing steadily cooler not hotter since 2003 meanwhile the winter of 2007 was the coldest in the us in decades after al gore warned us that we were about to see the end of winter as we know it
1271542 in a may issue of nature evidence about falling global temperatures forced german climatologists to conclude that the transformation of our planet into a permanent sauna is taking a decade long hiatus at least then this month came former greenhouse gas alarmist david evanss article in the australian stating that since 1999 evidence has been accumulating that man made carbon emissions cant be the cause of global warming by now that evidence evans said has become pretty conclusive
1271543 yet believers in man made global warming demand more and more money to combat climate change and still more drastic changes in our economic output and lifestyle the reason is that precisely that they are believers not scientists no amount of empirical evidence will overturn what has become not a scientific theory but a form of religion
1271544 this is not the first time of course that superstition has paraded itself as science or created a priesthood masquerading as the exponents of reason at the beginning of the previous century we had the fascination with eugenics when the gores of the age such as e a ross and ernst haeckel warned that modern industrial society was headed for race suicide
1271545 the list of otherwise sensible people who endorsed this hokum from winston churchill to oliver wendell holmes is embarrassing to read today then as now money was poured into foundations institutes and university chairs for the study of eugenics and racial hygiene then as now it was claimed that there was a scientific consensus that modern man was degenerating himself into extinction doubters such as german anthropologist rudolf virchow were dismissed as reactionaries or even as tools of the principal contaminators of racial purity the jews
1271546 and then as now proponents of eugenics turned to the all powerful state to avert catastrophe a credulous and submissive public allowed politicians to pass laws permitting forced sterilisation of the feeble minded racial screening for immigration quotas minimum wage laws which sidney and beatrice webb saw as a way to force the mentally unfit out of the labor market and other legislation which in retrospect set the stage for the humanitarian catastrophe to come in fact when the nazis took power in 1933 they found that the weimar republic had passed all the euthanasia legislation they needed to eliminate germanys useless mouths the next target on their racial hygiene list would be the jews
1271547 real science rests on a solid bedrock of scepticism a scepticism not only about certain religious or cultural assumptions for example about race but also about itself it constantly re examines what it regards as evidence and the connections it draws between cause and effect it never rushes to judgment as race science did in germany in the 1930s and as the high priests of climate change are doing today
1271548 make decisions that could trim australias gross domestic product by several percentage points a year and impose heavy penalties on australians lifestyle labour and liberal alike need to re examine the superstition of global warming otherwise the only thing it will melt away is everyones civil liberty
1271549 water for elephants i enjoyed all three of her books
1271550 if they did not plan the construction the way they did then we could not have our second floor that was something truly remarkable that they planned it that way we kept making that point during our referendum they did the footings so we could do this that took a lot of foresight they believed this community would grow and that it would need this library

1271645 a group of academics and met office scientists has unearthed the records dating from the 1600s and examined more than 6 000 logs which have provided one of the worlds best sources for long term weather data their studies have raised questions about modern climate change theories a paper by dennis wheeler a geographer based at sunderland university recounts an increasing number of summer storms over britain in the late 17th century many scientists believe that storms are caused by global warming but these were came during the so called little ice age that affected europe from about 1600 to 1850 the records also suggest that europe saw a spell of rapid warming similar to that experienced today during the 1730s that must have been caused naturally

1271650 what matters is not that change is happening but that it is happening so fast in ilulissat the ice that once covered much of the sea in the winter and allowed hunting fishing and travel by dogsled comes no longer in less than a human lifetime barely the blink of an eye in geologic time a way of life millenniums old will be lost here elsewhere we may see temperate and fertile areas turn dry and barren in the same time period what weve known and lived with may no longer exist and we may not be able to adapt in time for what is coming
1271651 a new dutch study of 17 years of satellite measurements of ice movement in western greenland concludes that the speedup of the ice is a transient summertime phenomenon with the overall yearly movement of the grinding glaciers not changing and actually dropping slightly in some places when measured over longer time spans

1271950 transferring these results to the gcc economies it thus seems possible to dissolve price and inflationary pressures resulting from the assumed income and demand shocks by a sufficiently large nominal appreciation
1271951 the interaction of rent wage and general price increases in particular in qatar and the uae appears to have the potential to set the stage for a wage price spiral which might make it difficult to anchor inflation expectations

1271970 this is the first decline seen since may 2005 and follows several months of falling manufacturing sector confidence indicators
1271971 the global economic turbulence clearly shows in the 0 8 per cent drop in freight volumes compared to last year although the passenger demand grew by 3 8 per cent this is the slowest growth that we have seen since the industry was hit by the sars crisis in 2003

1271973 the airline sector is in trouble losses this year could reach 6 1 billion dh22 3bn more than wiping out the 5 6bn that airlines made in 2007
1271974 falling demand and rising costs are re shaping the industry
1271975 to survive the crisis urgent action is needed airports and air navigation service providers must come to the table with efficiencies that deliver cost savings
1271976 labour must understand that efficiency is the only path to job security and governments must stop crazy taxation and give airlines the freedom to merge and consolidate where it makes business sense

1271984 uae banks and other financing institutions are facing major challenges in their lending activities in the real estate sector
1271985 they include mainly an expected surge in funding the absence of proper legislations to regulate the mortgage loans a possible decline or stagnation in the real estate sector in the foreseeable future and the absence of long term studies on the property sector
1271986 real estate loans are usually long term and they could negatively impact the banks liquidity since their main financial sources are short term deposits what they need to do is to seek new long term financial sources
1271987 but risks remain ahead some debtors might fail to pay back while the real estate market could go through a price correction period and this will certainly hit financing operations a bigger risk is that a decline might take place in the property sector in the uae and other gulf states which are experiencing a construction boom banks and other institutions should exercise utmost care and derive lessons from what happened in the us where major financial institutions reeled under heavy losses
1271988 i know there has been a sharp rise in mortgage loans in the uae due to the current boom in the real estate sector but this is normal for a country witnessing an economic boom and having a large banking sector
1271989 i dont think this increase is worrying because the total size of those credits has remained within reasonable levels and on the safe side at the same time banks in the uae are enjoying a strong position and they are diversifying their lending activities any problem in their housing loans could be offset in other sectors

1272004 sir alex bergeming tak mau melepas ronaldo saat ini bahkan jika hanya secara prinsip tapi sudah ada satu dua orang di united yang berpikir apa gunanya mempertahankan dia ketika real siap mengucurkan uang banyak dan ronaldo juga akan absen di awal musim karena cedera
1272005 salah satu solusi yang sedang dipertimbangkan adalah ronaldo bakal tinggal semusim lagi dengan jaminan dia bisa pergi di akhir musim nanti dengan harga yang sudah disepakati

1272047 so many people expect us to get gold medals and it really is a great pressure for us sometimes i find it hard to breathe or even cry under the pressure
1272048 fighting on home soil may be an advantage in other sports but in shooting we call it the home venue curse
1272049 mother tongue interference and home advantage pressure are the biggest obstacles
1272050 if they talk in foreign languages its just a noise but if they talk in chinese i will subconsciously try to understand and this is a distraction i have to overcome

1272060 from what i hear it is going to be quite challenging
1272061 also because of the conditions of the heat humidity and pollution it is going to be very demanding
1272062 it is true we are one of the most important teams in the race but germany and italy are also strong
1272063 i think here we are all mentally well prepared and everyone is going to try their best

1272074 we know we have to play well the u s and spain are the best two teams in the world and if we want to win gold we know we have to go through them
1272075 the last two major international tournaments the u s finished third we play a bit more european like spain with the tough defense and fast break than the nba style the u s play but i think we can beat both of them
1272076 it will be a tough tournament with lots of amazing teams but well find a way to win

1272083 the humidity in cincinnati was unbelievable it was well over 100 degrees 38 degrees celsius out on court
1272084 it comes from training and the gym work that you do off the court because that eliminates all your possible excuses
1272085 you get on the court thinking about tennis not worrying whether youve practiced enough or done enough work in the gym i feel much better physically
1272086 quite a few of the tennis players are staying in hotels but i dont understand why theyre doing that

1272310 and it can help us get attention to the wider issue that this is happening all over the country not just to illegal immigrants but legal and anyone who is perceived to be latino
1272311 ive heard things like we dont want to send our kids back to school because were afraid people dont like mexicans
1272312 thats shocking to me that is not the shenandoah i know
1272313 but i do believe that the inflammatory rhetoric in the immigration debate does have a correlation with increased violence against latinos
1272314 but i dont believe our ordinance had anything to do with it every person is responsible for their own actions
1272315 we are prepared to deal with any kind of security threat and we are confident we will have a safe and peaceful olympic games

1272336 it has the potential to give farmers a much finer control of pastures finer management of where animals are and a better use of the land
1272337 with this technology we can also find out what the animals do all day
1272338 with virtual fencing you would have the ability in real time to manage the animals across the landscape to avoid that situation
1272339 if there are areas that are overused you could move an animal off those areas more rapidly
1272340 virtual fencing could take all this labor included with removing physical mundane barriers and focus more on management
1272341 its looking for the best management with the best skills that technology can provide

1272353 die meisten kinder ben tigen hilfe beim einschlafen das ist v llig normal
1272354 tags ber spielen spazieren gehen und in normaler lautst rke reden auch wenn das kleine gerade mittagschlaf macht nachts gibts gespr che nur im fl sterton und h chstens d mmerlicht auch beim f ttern und wickeln
1272355 und gerade weil babys von der zuwendung ihrer eltern so abh ngig sind erleben sie die zur ckweisung die mit solchen programmen verbunden ist als sehr bedrohlich
1272356 nicht am gesunden schlafverhalten des babys herumdoktern sondern sich selbst das leben leichter machen
1272357 das einzige was daran bewiesen ist kinder wachen nachts auf
1272358 meist gen gt es ihnen jedoch schon die eltern im schlaf atmen zu h ren um wieder einzuschlafen es muss keinesfalls alles wie beim einschlafen sein die situation ist ja auch eine v llig andere einmal m ssen die kinder von der aufregung des tages runterkommen das ist richtig schwer nachts hingegen geht es nur um eine kurze r ckversicherung mama und papa sind noch da

1272373 mr rudd and mr swan between them over eight months have destroyed business and consumer confidence in the australian economy
1272374 they talked up inflation as being a crisis they delivered higher taxes in the budget and now weve seen petrol and grocery prices increase

1272378 it changes cables competitive posture against satellite it makes the services less expensive to provide and it makes it easier to upgrade the services
1272379 cablevision has been innovative here and i think other cable companies will follow them
1272380 in short order effective dvr penetration could now jump to north of 60 percent of cable households that is all digital cable subscribers
1272381 that means a huge increase in the number of viewing hours per day potentially subject to ad skipping
1272382 it allows advertisers to do things they cant do on a physical dvr
1272383 lets say you record an episode of lost three months later you want to play it back the advertising that was on lost is stale and no longer applies but the capability to refresh the advertising exists if the content owner wants to do that with the cable operator

1272390 i do not wish to go any further into the circumstances leading up to or surrounding her hospital admission
1272391 to do so publicly at this point is not in paulas best interests
1272392 there has been speculation within the media that paulas hospitalisation is in some way related to comments by sam newman on
1272393 this is not the case mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues rather a culmination of personal and political pressure

1272402 the top people should be booted out and replaced by executives who have the confidence of the markets
1272403 this company has to answer to shareholders to our regulator and to congress and those groups often demand completely contradictory things
1272404 sure its hard to deal with the pressures of congress and shareholders and regulators
1272405 but thats why executives get paid so much its not acceptable to blame those pressures for making bad choices
1272406 there is little to nothing that freddie mac could have done to prevent the losses that it is now incurring
1272407 youve got the worst housing crisis in u s recorded history and were the largest housing finance company in the country so when one goes down the other goes with it
1272408 the thinking was that if something really bad happened to the housing market then the government would need freddie and fannie more than ever and would have to rescue them
1272409 everybody understood that at some level the company was putting taxpayers at risk
1272410 it basically worked exactly as everyone expected when things got bad the government came to the rescue
1272411 but we didnt expect it would come at the cost of a new regulator who now has the power to burrow into our business forever

1272461 for a governing party to rig election rules just months before an election in order to cling on to power has all the hallmarks of a banana republic it is quite proper for the electoral commission to raise concerns over such partisan moves by the government and there is also a real prospect of a legal challenge in the courts against such flawed new laws
1272462 i loved that bit with the tiger you know when it comes into the archipelago and starts eating all the sheep

1272464 yeah the bit with the tiger is good but what about the bit with the football match
1272465 theyre all trying to escape from the archipelago so they challenge the germans to this big match
1272466 luckily theyve got loads of international players on their team but they have to put this big stupid american in goals because hes really important to the war effort

1272482 thats when the problems began jenni kroons diabetes took a turn for the worse requiring increased out of pocket outlays for doctor visits and expensive medicines then ryan lost his job when his brothers residential construction company folded

1272504 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
1272505 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
1272506 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money

1272525 despite the undoubted pedigree of the competition the uk consumer easily wins the title of the most pessimistic in europe and probably the developed world even us confidence has been more resilient
1272526 surging inflation and rising unemployment are likely to have been the main contributors given the recently announced huge increases in utility bills which came after the consumer confidence survey was conducted there remains scope for a further decline in the coming months ani

1272543 if anwar loses in the by election political parties in sabah and sarawak will lose confidence in pakatan rakyats chances of ruling the country in the future
1272544 the state dap will send a strong team and also arrange buses to ferry workers and supporters to help anwar in the campaign
1272545 the by election is important as it will be a benchmark on whether the rakyat will support the pakatan rakyat in the next general election to form the federal government
1272546 political parties in sabah and sarawak need to make a decision to join pr before the next polls

1272548 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close fly by
1272549 for the first three weeks of the campaign however only the powerful eyes of osiris will actually be able to spot the asteroid which will look only like a dot in the sky
1272550 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
1272551 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1272552 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september

1272580 i love diving and i want to see the united states divers do the best they can to reach the highest level
1272581 my family are really happy i am here and proud of what i am doing and they will support both china and the united states team
1272582 its not as though chinas divers are perfect but there is something to learn from them
1272583 the divers in the united states have the same passion they love their sport just as much and their families make the same sacrifices to help them so we are all on the same page
1272584 at the 2004 olympics the team didnt do so well but we have worked hard in the last three years brought home medals a for competitions and i believe we will break through here
1272585 there is nothing to choose between the united states and chinas teams we have a lot of respect for them and they are great friends of ours
1272586 they push us higher and you have to be on top of your game against them
1272587 hes ahead of what he was doing last year at the same period
1272588 i am confident in theo but its down to performances
1272589 his first touch is much better he moves the ball quicker and his penetration his final ball is better
1272590 his goal scoring potential is in him and i hope we get that out of him

1272596 architects have no general freestanding duty to comb through public records or to visit project sites in order to police their copyrights
1272597 using the standard of a reason to know requires the copyright owner to aggressively police their work with some things it makes more sense such as books and movies things that are more widely disseminated
1272598 in the context of architectural copyright its kind of difficult
1272599 agassi at 29 would make him look like an amateur
1272600 if u dont like him thats straight but to make a fking anti lupe movement is just wack
1272601 fo every ill rhyme put a dollar in the bank
1272602 the delegates have spoken and thats it end of story
1272603 when one contests such elections one has to have an open mind knowing that things can go wrong
1272604 this situation in our tribal areas is similar to that of pre 9 11 afghanistan state authority in those regions has nearly ended militants fighting in both pakistan and afghanistan now control this area which threatens the whole region
1272605 we have repeatedly demanded a solution to this situation because we do not want these regions to turn into the battleground of a global conflict as global powers respond to the threats emanating from these regions might be tempted to intervene militarily
1272606 the people of fata are hostages in the hands of the militants and the federal government has allowed that because they have not really tried to clear these regions from armed bands
1272607 so on the one hand people in fata have been threatened by the militants on the other the government still wants to perpetuate discriminatory laws in that region
1272608 now when the foreigners u s and nato forces intervene in these regions they only rely on military means long range artillery and aerial bombing
1272609 the arab militants are fighting their war against the united states on pashtun soil pakistan and india too want to fight their conflict on pashtun soil and the pashtuns are dying as a result
1272610 a whole generation of pashtun youth in swat dir and other war ravaged regions are deprived of education as their schools are closed
1272611 what i see is deeply disturbing the destruction that we have seen so far is nothing and six months from now people will remember the current state as being a lot better
1272612 but some fighting will go on while there is parallel economic development and education also has to go on to move the whole situation towards normalcy but now we have not even started to move that way and the whole situation is going towards further destruction and bloodshed
1272613 i think we have to recognise that giving children the capacity to record incidents sometimes encourages them to either provoke violence or to record or encourage some acting
1272614 weve got to be quite concerned about the compulsory nature of unit pricing on small independent retailers and grocers throughout the country
1272615 we know that coles and woolworths and franklins are able to and some of them have already started to move in the direction of unit pricing but youve got to be very concerned about the impact on small retailers and small grocers throughout australia
1272616 unit pricing will help consumers make significant savings if they use it to pursue the best value between brands and supermarkets
1272617 australian consumers would significantly benefit if coles and woolworths faced more competitive threats that encouraged more aggressive pricing strategies
1272618 mr rudd and mr swan between them over eight months have destroyed business and consumer confidence in the australian economy
1272619 they talked up inflation as being a crisis they delivered higher taxes in the budget and now weve seen petrol and grocery prices increase
1272620 that was always mr rudds plan to slow the economy
1272621 and now the reserve bank is in a position in looking forward where it is so concerned about the state of the australian economy that its forecasting there may be room to reduce interest rates in the future
1272622 these measures are preventing all but the most affluent young buyers from getting a toehold in the housing market he said
1272623 it is clear that regulatory restrictions are fuelling the high cost of building new homes
1272624 by contrast us cities with few regulatory restrictions such as atlanta houston and dallas have seen stable prices in the housing market dr moran said
1272625 our family is aware there is a lot of speculation and conjecture about her situation within the community
1272626 i do not wish to go any further into the circumstances leading up to or surrounding her hospital admission
1272627 to do so publicly at this point is not in paulas best interests
1272628 there has been speculation within the media that paulas hospitalisation is in some way related to comments by sam newman on
1272629 this is not the case mr newmans comments are not in any way linked to paulas current health issues rather a culmination of personal and political pressure
1272630 it is important that the community understands she is not blaming anyone else
1272631 we may have have a situation where wild dogs are a problem and that is something that we definitely need to control so koalas and other native wildlife are protected
1272632 but lets not go and try for the cheap stunt of blaming responsible pet owners when we need to be looking at the bigger issues
1272633 telling people what kind of pets they can have telling people whether they can have pets or not is a very big intrusion in the private lives of citizens and it is not a step you take lightly
1272634 that is why we have been very cautious in our approach this material is telling us that frankly we have been too cautious
1272635 this is the work of rivals jealous of my fame and they want to spoil the august release of kuselan and satyam both big budget ventures in which i play lead roles says nayantara without naming any of her rivals this statement she has made to one of tamil newspaper
1272636 we should just feel that it is an occupational hazard
1272637 i ve been asked again and again for my response to the now infamous mccain celebrity ad
1272638 i actually have three responses it is a complete waste of the money john mccain s contributors have donated to his campaign it is a complete waste of the country s time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1272639 i was shooting a malayalam movie in dubai we were shooting under a tight schedule and they couldnt do a single day without me that is when i got this call for making an appearance in she plays the character of an associate director which was not found in the malayalam original
1272640 i had a good time shooting with rajini sir he seemed to be a humble person it was very easy to pick up a conversation with him he is just like any other person i had my bit of interaction with rajini sir before i went for my first shot i was to say well done mr ashok and shake hands with him he is such a simple person that he does not make his co actors feel nervous i did not feel nervous either
1272641 as crazy as that sounds to say i wish i was still with my wife
1272642 for me to be able to handle my 50 year old wife sleeping in a bed with a 19 year old boyfriend and using my gym and driving my cars and living in my house i guess weve got a pretty good act going on cause thats a lot to take on
1272643 it wasnt an argument it was hey i dont love you i dont want to be with you i dont want to see you anymore it was the real deal
1272644 without a doubt this one is the most formidable opponent ive ever run into
1272645 you talk about dirty tricks brass knuckles steel knuckles cheap shots tripping people up ive never seen anybody in the wrestling business that has more dirty tricks than she does i guess i taught her well
1272646 are you trying to tell me that a pair of partners at home are not going to discuss elements of the employment at work
1272647 he mr rudd said he would do something about the price of petrol he hasnt dr nelson said in sydney
1272648 he said hed do something about the price of groceries the report doesnt do anything about it at all
1272649 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down dr nelson said
1272650 a phone book can be provided at the guests request

1272667 we have been very concerned about the misunderstanding of our product in the marketplace and want to provide the facts so that consumers can make their choices based on science rather than urban myth hfcs and sugar are treated by the body the same they contain the same calories and nutritionally are no different
1272668 it has a crisper flavor not as cloying i think it is a better flavored drink

1272670 were being inundated with as many as a dozen pelicans a day
1272671 we believe its because pelicans have done well this year and produced lots of young
1272672 the high number of ailing birds is actually a good sign
1272673 a lot of these birds are basically starving to death
1272674 after three months of being fed in their breeding colonies this years young pelicans are beginning to disperse from their nests with enough baby fat to tide them over for a few months while they learn to fish
1272675 use up all that baby fat thats when they start showing up at rehabilitation centers
1272676 will they survive after we let them go hard to say
1272677 but i do know this we are giving these birds a second chance to get back in the wild and figure it all out

1272691 when two captains are resigning and saying i need to just get back to playing cricket and worrying about scoring runs theres too much pressure captaining its probably not the most positive way to step into it
1272692 everyone has their different techniques and he inspires those around him just by his performance and his belief

1272713 o livro claro tem um fio condutor que a saga do her i s que justamente a riqueza dele s o as historietas paralelas que acontecem no meio do caminho essa colagem de temas que s o essas coisas recolhidas do folclore
1272714 o disco funciona da mesma maneira cada m sica independente cada uma um assunto uma refer ncia como canto de pedinte can es do bumba meu boi rud uma ora o ao deus ind gena que provavelmente parece ser mais uma coisa da cabe a dele do que refer ncia folcl rica em forma e conte do ele usa essas refer ncias nas formas como algumas quadrinhas mas elas t m essa independ ncia essa liberdade de estar na hist ria e paralela a ela
1272715 justamente para convergir com essa diversidade que tem no livro
1272716 ao fazer fui vendo que funcionava embora os temas de cada m sica tenha essa independ ncia n o sei se pela for a de uma coisa que j est a h 80 anos vivendo mas tem um fio condutor hoje em dia n o muito comum ter um disco assim inteiro sobre um tema enfim estou presente em todas as m sicas n o s cantando mas na co produ o na dire o geral das coisas a foi surpreendente porque mesmo os produtores n o ouvindo o trabalho dos outros teve umas coisas em termos de sonoridade que conflu ram o resultado ficou org nico
1272717 porque mesmo a prosa tendo essas alitera es essas repeti es e essa cad ncia tive de cortar algumas coisas mas n o acrescentei nada nenhuma palavra

1272735 the last one was up and off the plate a little and i swung through it
1272736 he started throwing his breaking ball and he had enough on his fastball he made some pretty good pitches
1272737 i kind of sat back on it and pena was aggressive it fell in that little spot where we both wanted to make that last out and we should have talked more but soria came up big at the end
1272738 they were swinging at a lot of pitches up in the zone and luckily thats kind of where my release point was today and i got away with it

1272957 considero leviana uma informa o que circulou em determinada coluna de que levantar esse tema est vinculado a uma quest o sucess ria
1272958 primeiro porque n o sou candidato a presidente segundo porque quem conduz esse processo no nosso meio o presidente da rep blica e terceiro porque misturar uma quest o dessa seriedade que discutida em todo mundo com quest es pol ticas imediatas uma liga o absolutamente despropositada e falsa
1272959 a an lise dos fatos que est o sendo levantados por tarso cabe exclusivamente ao judici rio
1272960 absolutamente constitucional a interpreta o do ministro de que os crimes de tortura praticados durante o regime militar devem ser julgados
1272961 a constitui o de 1988 teve o car ter de fundar um novo regime jur dico e estabelece princ pios muitas vezes retroativos foi o que ocorreu na alemanha do p s guerra por exemplo e realmente a lei de anistia n o pode ser interpretada de forma a alcan ar crimes n o pol ticos e de les o humanidade como o de tortura

1272968 expor qualquer pessoa seja de que n vel social ela for
1272969 h um apenamento antecipado pela exposi o p blica na m dia isso uma atitude arbitr ria do estado que tem de ser vencida
1272970 n o se pode a pretexto de garantir os direitos fundamentais impedir que regularmente pelo mesmo processo criminal o minist rio p blico possa fazer prova e comprovar a legitimidade das a es
1272971 precisamos ter um controle das a es policiais discutamos a cria o de varas e corregedorias de pol cia no mbito federal por que n o precisamos estar abertos a essa discuss o exatamente para evitar os abusos podemos discutir isso no conselho nacional de justi a cnj fundamental que n s discutamos isso uma nova lei de abuso de autoridade eventualmente varas especializadas para corregedoria da pol cia e para contestar os abusos
1272972 combate criminalidade sim mas com respeito aos direitos fundamentais quem eventualmente defende a observ ncia dos direitos fundamentais n o est assumindo a defesa da corrup o todos queremos a efici ncia no combate criminalidade ningu m quer celebrar um pacto quanto impunidade mas n o nos dado fazer escolhas em rela o aos princ pios b sicos do estado de direito
1272973 os meios tecnol gicos dispon veis para investiga es da pol cia federal evolu ram profundamente nos ltimos 10 15 anos isso implicou uma transforma o da metodologia da investiga o que s vezes proporciona determinados excessos n s j remetemos ao congresso um projeto de lei que pro be por exemplo a grava o de conversa entre cliente e advogado quando esses meios tecnol gicos ainda n o eram dispon veis o inqu rito policial ordinariamente come ava com o interrogat rio do suspeito que se dava s vezes por meios n o ortodoxos n o constitucionais as pessoas sofriam viol ncia s vezes viol ncia f sica e aquele depoimento orientava o inqu rito que s vezes chegava cheio de v cios ao judici rio com as transforma es tecnol gicas que ocorreram foram oferecidos meios mais cient ficos de investiga o temos de ver a fase pela qual estamos passando como virtuosa uma coisa a persecu o criminal buscar a verdade quando se investiga um delito outra utilizar esses meios tecnol gicos para uma gest o manipulat ria do estado ou para a produ o de persecu es pol ticas
1272974 diante dos avan os tecnol gicos j n o se pode nem cumprir a lei estabelecida porque n o se consegue transcrever a quantidade de horas gravadas
1272975 existem in meras investiga es em curso em todo o brasil a maioria delas sem nenhuma utiliza o desses procedimentos de escuta telef nica mas n o v m ao conhecimento p blico o minist rio p blico tem trabalhado firmemente para impedir esses desvios em opera es da pol cia federal que devem ser punidos e essa puni o s vir com absoluta certeza a operacionaliza o do trabalho do minist rio p blico s ser definitiva quando tivermos mecanismos mais efetivos de controle dos atos que s o feitos
1272976 a quest o do vazamento em dropes parcelado de informa es muito grave s vezes com intuito de prejudicar a imagem das pessoas de forma indel vel n o poss vel que o estado valendo se de um poder excepcional fa a isto n o razo vel fundamental que se co ba esse tipo de pr tica e a m dia aqui tem responsabilidade fundamental que discutamos isso com toda a abertura o vazamento hoje n o mais a exce o a regra
1272977 neste momento h tamb m um interesse da m dia em divulgar o minist rio p blico tem feito um esfor o muito grande mas reconhece ainda dificuldades principalmente nessa quest o de vazamentos de identificar a autoria eu acho que devemos trabalhar o crit rio de se dar mais seguran a nesses procedimentos para garantir exatamente o conhecimento das pessoas que manusearam informa o a partir de que momento e de onde ela partiu
1272978 temos de verificar regrar algum tipo de precau o contra a divulga o de informa es infamantes e caluniosas sem ferir a liberdade de imprensa isso tem de passar inclusive por um pacto com a pr pria imprensa porque s vezes o que se v al m do vazamento que j uma ilegalidade o uso calunioso do vazamento
1272979 n o podemos aceitar a l gica de que a defesa atrapalha de que se a defesa atrapalha devemos acabar com o direito de defesa no brasil esse um debate atual porque temos um projeto disposi o do presidente lula que trata exclusivamente de reconhecer que no conflito estado cidad o o cidad o n o pode ser a v tima do estado a forma pela qual o cidad o fala para o estado atrav s do seu advogado da sua defesa alguns acusadores passaram a imagem de que iam transformar os escrit rios em dep sitos do crime colocariam se cad veres em escrit rios de advocacia ou n o compreenderam o que a democracia o estado democr tico de direito ou n o leram o projeto atividade criminosa n o inerente advocacia o crime n o tem liga o com a advocacia n o tem nunca teve e nunca ter o apoio da ordem a primeira mentira que foi contada e repetida repete se e as pessoas acreditam nela de que esse projeto blinda a advocacia o que o projeto quis estabelecer e o fez muito bem foi separar o joio do trigo um erro n o pode justificar o outro se algum advogado errou compactuou com o crime ele deixa de ser advogado e passa a ser criminoso comum como qualquer outro e tem a pol cia federal o direito de entrar no escrit rio de advocacia e processar a ele e a seu cliente o que n o pode n o deve sen o n o estar amos no estado democr tico de direito interferir na defesa escutar a defesa bisbilhotar a defesa espionar a defesa
1272980 quando se discutem quest es sobre a liberdade do juiz de primeira inst ncia devemos levar em conta este fen meno o controle ideol gico e muitas vezes psicol gico que se exerce contra essas pessoas n o h na hist ria do mundo na hist ria universal qualquer exemplo de pa s que tenha preservado a democracia tendo transformado a pol cia em poder onde a pol cia se transformou em poder a democracia feneceu h casos de den ncia que beiram a aventura o processo anaconda sobre venda de senten as judiciais denunciou juiz por ter conta no afeganist o
1272981 o que estamos propondo revogarmos no brasil esse estado de medo que atinge todos e n o atinge s a advocacia atinge a todos n s ningu m quer decidir mais nada ningu m quer fazer mais nada com medo da responsabiliza o com medo de ser apontado no outro dia como criminoso em potencial ficamos raciocinando pela l gica do medo e o medo raciocinado sempre fazendo com que o estado seja a raz o de todas as coisas e o cidad o um criminoso em potencial em todas as coisas o estado tudo pode pode controlar o cidad o n o tenho d vida ministro gilmar mendes de que n o estamos em um estado policial o tema desta confer ncia uma reflex o para que evitemos enquanto tempo e cheguemos a essa discuss o
1272982 a pol cia federal n o uma institui o soberana se assim o fosse se colocaria acima dos demais poderes de estado e ter amos aqui no brasil um estado policial isso n o existe perdoe britto perdoe gilmar mendes mas n o verdade que estejamos num estado de medo isso n o verdade at porque se n s corrigirmos essas a es da pf a es determinadas pelo poder judici rio corrigirmos erros do judici rio da primeira inst ncia segunda inst ncia corrigirmos erros do minist rio p blico n o vamos acabar com as escutas telef nicas
1272983 quando n s discutimos a quest o do uso das algemas num cidad o que foi preso pela pol cia federal eu me propus a seguinte quest o todas as pessoas t m de ser tratadas de maneira igual a lei permite que o agente verifique a oportunidade ou n o de custodiar aquela pessoa mediante algemas enquanto a lei n o for modificada isso est delegado ao agente agora o que n o podemos expor qualquer pessoa seja de que n vel social ela for h um apenamento antecipado pela sua exposi o p blica na m dia isso uma atitude arbitr ria do estado que tem de ser vencida
1272984 em rela o s algemas e aqui tamb m eu ressalto a comunh o de pensamento com o ministro tarso que n o se trata de privilegiar pobres ou ricos n s queremos direitos fundamentais para todos e n o enfatizarmos um modelo de classes queremos direitos fundamentais para todos a pris o em muitos casos s se justifica para fazer a imagem e a imagem com algema prender algemar e expor no jornal nacional n s vamos discutir essa quest o na quinta feira j existe em rela o a todos indigna o sobre uso de algema sejam pobres ou ricos em mat ria de habeas corpus o tribunal extremamente aberto est vamos discutindo uma quest o relevant ssima da progress o de regime a partir da provoca o de um r u ele pr prio impetrou habeas corpus de uma carta feita em pres dio temos uma sociedade marcadamente desigual logo o acesso justi a tamb m comprometido muitas vezes as pessoas n o chegam ao supremo tribunal federal porque n o t m advogado
1272985 dif cil porque s o dois valores um o direito informa o e a busca da not cia um dos aspectos mais relevantes da sociedade democr tica de outra parte a preserva o da integridade moral do indiv duo problem tico tamb m porque hoje a pol tica se transformou em um grande espet culo com a cria o de muitos fatos midi ticos e pouco conte do e isso n o uma decad ncia da democracia uma nova etapa sobre a qual n s devemos nos debru ar para localiz la isso s poderia ser resolvido por uma normatiza o forte da lei de abuso de autoridade e concomitante um grande pacto pol tico uma concerta o pol tica do estado com a imprensa que exerce uma fun o p blica relevante a imprensa hoje n o mais como a segunda guerra mundial que tentava interferir no comportamento
1272986 o minist rio p blico defende a ampla defesa dos acusados mas tamb m defende a sua possibilidade e pelos mesmos recursos que a lei garante de fazer prova tem de haver um equil brio tamb m n o se pode a pretexto de garantir os direitos fundamentais impedir que regularmente pelo mesmo processo criminal o minist rio p blico possa fazer prova e comprovar a legitimidade das a es estamos tratando de algo que pede o equil brio de todos
1272987 o minist rio p blico embora seja organicamente estatal est funcionalmente mais vinculado sociedade essa conforma o reflexo da inter rela o entre esfera p blica e privada a institui o se move exclusivamente pelo princ pio da legalidade n o da legalidade burocr tica mas daquela que possui o atributo da constitucionalidade n o se trata de invadir compet ncias alheias nem de construir seu conceito pr prio de legalidade o minist rio p blico n o pol tico
1272988 em rela o ao caso espec fico da opera o satiagraha vazaram informa es e declara es do delegado encarregado prot genes queiroz que deixou o caso alegando falta de pessoal e press o dos superiores que s o contradit rias com essa falta de pessoal ele dizia que n o informava aos seus superiores sobre as condi es da opera o porque n o tinha confian a que eles iriam dar for a para a investiga o que ele estava fazendo como os superiores iriam saber se estava faltando pessoal insan vel essa contradi o tanto verdade que no momento em que o delegado saiu rapidamente se montou uma equipe de policiais que vieram de bras lia e de outros lugares foi repassado o inqu rito e ele est em andamento sem nenhuma espetacularidade se esse inqu rito eventualmente n o alcan ar as suas finalidades eu quero dizer que n o por falta de pessoal porque quem sabe teve ou poder ter algum v cio de origem mas quero dizer o seguinte as investiga es que est o sendo feitas j proporcionaram den ncia por suborno de delegado o trabalho est sendo feito muito bem feito com t cnica neutralidade e com foco isso que est sendo feito nesse caso da satiagraha
1272989 j conversei com o ministro da justi a fundamental que fa amos um pacto de combate corrup o e ao crime organizado necessariamente esse pacto envolver todos os agentes respons veis e que querem um brasil melhor
1272990 o minist rio p blico tamb m atende a essa sugest o quero lembrar minha fala inicial o compromisso do minist rio p blico com a dignidade humana n o apenas no foco da investiga o criminal o minist rio p blico atua firmemente respeitando seguramente os direitos da pessoa na atividade de investiga o criminal e desenvolve um trabalho extremamente produtivo e profundo em favor dos direitos de todas as ordens em favor dos cidad os todos t m conhecimento da atua o firme na defesa do meio ambiente da probidade administrativa dos ndios esse trabalho intenso e firme o trabalho tem de ser de conviv ncia de respeito
1272991 n s concordamos com a cria o de uma comiss o de alto n vel j estamos trabalhando nesse sentido com o ministro gilmar mendes o procurador geral da rep blica e a oab para uma segunda rodada de reformas
1272992 fundamental que fa amos aquilo que eu chamei de uma fuga pra frente
1272993 gostei das manifesta es do procurador e do ministro pelos direitos fundamentais temos institutos ultrapassados que devem ser adaptados
1272994 o di logo fluiu bem mas preciso ancor lo em projetos concretos a quest o da repress o ao abuso de autoridade um dos pontos principais
1272995 fundamental para que nossas diferen as sociais sejam extirpadas do nosso meio ter lado a lado o ministro da justi a e o presidente do stf
1272996 pela primeira vez eles sentaram e trocaram id ias ao menos elas est o convergentes o problema agora levar isso ao terreno da pr tica
1272997 preciso mostrar que nem sempre um juiz ou um promotor est certo e associar a busca pela verdade com a busca pela preserva o de direitos
1272998 discutir uma nova lei de abuso de autoridade como fizeram os debatedores talvez seja o caminho ideal para uma conseq ncia mais objetiva
1272999 um debate excelente e muito esclarecedor o ministro gilmar mendes se saiu muito bem e o estad o est de parab ns pela iniciativa
1273000 os debatedores mostraram que a fam lia forense tem diverg ncias e que a cria o de corregedorias de pol cia de extrema relev ncia
1273001 a constitui o est sendo vilipendiada em todo o pa s parece que h uma briga entre a primeira e a terceira inst ncia e isso ficou claro no debate
1273002 o di logo sempre fundamental ele se mostra muito mais necess rio medida que o problema se agrava justific vel estabelecer esse debate
1273003 a oab fez seu lobby o presidente britto colocou uma inverdade de que estar amos pr ximos de um estado policial

1273011 the longer it takes who knows he is deciding whether its time to retire or not
1273012 hes avoiding a favre like mistake by taking his time
1273013 we price in us dollars and i dont have to tell you about whats happened in the last few years
1273014 the cost of doing business outside the us has dramatically changed its reasonably likely well have some sort of price hike the pressure has built in the last few years
1273015 we dont see pricing as a way of weathering the downturn
1273016 last year services revenue was eight percent of total revenue and i think were pretty low when it comes to our peers we can help by having a larger capability we can probably get that to eight to 12 percent of revenue
1273017 you need people with soap skills and theyre not likely to be found in such companies and if you look to employ them theyre likely to be expensive
1273018 a user would be able to create applications by working with a drag and drop design tool within a web browser

1273023 its difficult to envisage a sharp recovery in the second half considering the prevailing softness in global demand and rising costs the business environment is not favorable
1273024 but one thing is for sure you may be rest assured the relative competitive gap between us and the rest of the pack will increase in the third quarter
1273025 dell understands that software and services are a critical component of their long term strategy it looks as though they are looking to start testing the waters with that direction with a low cost entertainment device as a start
1273026 mobile is an enticing market because it is so large however it is highly fragmented which makes it a tough market as well
1273027 an internet consumer platform to allow users to access and purchase digital entertainment content
1273028 if you are not entirely dependent on it to do business and succeed competitively now you will be by the time im finished speaking
1273029 i run a flower shop not a computer company that doesnt apply to me
1273030 the indiscriminate distribution of guns is an offense against god and humanity
1273031 if you ask me what is the best religion for me of course i will answer buddhism
1273032 reform judaism is all about tolerance and individual choice everyone is entitled to his or her own values and beliefs and if you say that one is better than another you are just insulting other people and undermining tolerance just dont go there
1273033 the personal and communal ethics of the torah and talmud and the peace and holiness they bring to daily life to love and work when they are put into practice are our distinctive treasure and where we are better
1273034 there is a tremendous gap between number one and number two
1273035 the share of the vote in these seats at the last election would have been con 38 1 lab 30 8 ldem 24 5 others 6 6
1273036 but you seem incapable of accounting for normal statistical problems such as margin for error and selectivity
1273037 i came here because in the 1970s i read this one little book that completely changed everything for me when i heard the news yesterday it was a terrible blow for me
1273038 he wasnt afraid to speak his mind he was an example for us all
1273039 he was not one of those people that everyone loves but he was one of those people whose role in history cannot be exaggerated it is not just significant it is enormous
1273040 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1273041 theres no doubt today that what is happening now is far more profound and will be more prolonged than people thought 12 months ago when the problems first arose
1273042 the important thing is that we are straight with people we are going through a tough time thats likely to continue for a while we are no exception every country in the world is going through this
1273043 i am looking at a number of measures and im not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1273044 its helping people thats important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1273045 there are two problems in relation to windfall taxes one is the principle and one is the practicality two years ago people were calling for a windfall tax on the banks i dont think anyone will be doing that today
1273046 i think the principle of providing certainty and stability especially if you take our energy companies where i want them to be investing in new plant and power stations i think thats very important
1273047 my main focus is on working with them to see how we can help their customers meet the higher bills that they are facing at the moment
1273048 the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1273049 it is very clear to me that provided we can get across to people what we are for and the difference government can make the clear principle of fairness that governs everything we do then we can turn the situation around
1273050 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1273051 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1273052 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems
1273053 i think the answer to the second question would be crewe
1273054 the majority of people listening to this in homes up and down the country will be outraged
1273055 uk polls because the vast majority of those polled are in england and increasingly for them scotland is another country far away
1273056 uk polls are polled in england because its part of the uk your sentence implies but does not state that uk polls exclude non english samples which would be incorrect
1273057 salmond is noticably cooler on specifying details on any referendum for example than his party and indeed much of what he says on the topic is a coded attempt to manage expectations in the case of failure to either secure or win a vote on independence
1273058 even the most populist media seems to have suggested that we dislike him because hes scottish
1273059 philip johnson the english are sick of being run by scots in london and have got so bored of scottish politics they dont care
1273060 let me put a simple counterpoint for you if it is scottish oil then you are saying the continental shelf was has been and remains secured by the scottish navy are you
1273061 where do you think the ira got all those kalashnikovs from do you think semtex was available on the open market
1273062 what is important to note is that you seem to recognise external threats but not the potential for internal problems
1273063 but the english are not the cause of scottish problems and independence is not the solution because try as you might to spin your yarn in the opposite direction it always unravels on closer inspection
1273064 our charges remain within the limit we are allowed to charge by our regulator the civil aviation authority
1273065 we are going to fight the action we dont think the fees are warranted
1273066 it has the potential to give farmers a much finer control of pastures finer management of where animals are and a better use of the land
1273067 with this technology we can also find out what the animals do all day
1273068 with virtual fencing you would have the ability in real time to manage the animals across the landscape to avoid that situation
1273069 if there are areas that are overused you could move an animal off those areas more rapidly
1273070 virtual fencing could take all this labor included with removing physical mundane barriers and focus more on management
1273071 its looking for the best management with the best skills that technology can provide
1273072 if you try to get them to move from point a to point b and you dont understand their behavior youre less likely to have success
1273073 our batting has been hugely disappointing there were quite a few silly shots played
1273074 the good teams the clinical teams will close out those games with eight wickets in hand we didnt do that
1273075 i just said to kev were going to get a bad ball and when we do were going to put it away
1273076 also we just picked off the ones and twos and i just hope the guys who were sitting in the hutch could realise how easy it was to do that
1273077 the kenyans did bowl well but they are not really the kind of bowling team that should have had us struggling to get 68 off 20 overs
1273078 ryan ten doeschate is in my opinion probably the best player in associate cricket outside of andre botha
1273079 alex has come on and is now a senior member of the squad
1273080 i killed him hes f k ing dead hes dead and
1273081 like she used to but that she had never liked playing her partners sex games
1273082 there was nothing to suggest he was forced into a position and bound he said
1273083 i came here because in the 1970s i read this one little book that completely changed everything for me when i heard the news yesterday it was a terrible blow for me
1273084 he wasnt afraid to speak his mind he was an example for us all
1273085 he was not one of those people that everyone loves but he was one of those people whose role in history cannot be exaggerated it is not just significant it is enormous
1273086 these measures are preventing all but the most affluent young buyers from getting a toehold in the housing market he said
1273087 it is clear that regulatory restrictions are fuelling the high cost of building new homes
1273088 by contrast us cities with few regulatory restrictions such as atlanta houston and dallas have seen stable prices in the housing market dr moran said
1273089 i think we need to listen to the psychologist who looked into this
1273090 this is different in the sense that its interactive people get immersed in these games i think theres a real risk as a society i think we can live without it
1273091 you cant say just because you can see it you should be allowed to see it otherwise youd legalise snuff movies and all sorts of profane things which i dont think take our society ahead
1273092 we had a thing with amatars avatars is that the right term
1273093 and if you dont you suffer what comes next i too have got four kids and youve got to think i want these kids to grow up in quiet unaffected streets and if theres someone playing a videogame where theyre raping someone im not feeling good about the place so knock it out
1273094 as a mother of three kids two of whom spend an awful lot of time playing these sorts of games i just find the whole thing appalling the sort of minds that come up with stuff
1273095 grand theft auto was one of the more famous games that seemed to turn everyone into a car thief my children thankfully didnt do that
1273096 im not a censorship girl but violent games violence breeds violence its not nice
1273097 he mr rudd said he would do something about the price of petrol he hasnt dr nelson said in sydney
1273098 he said hed do something about the price of groceries the report doesnt do anything about it at all
1273099 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down dr nelson said

1273103 this program will increase italys ability to contribute to future nato coalition and anti terrorism operations that the us may undertake
1273104 we have turned a corner in warfare by bringing in this new platform that complements and i stress complements our incredible manned capacity today
1273105 by acquiring this capability germany will be able to provide the same level of protection for its own forces as those of the united states
1273106 the iocs priority is to ensure that as many people as possible get to experience the magic of the olympic games and the inspirational sporting achievements of the olympic athletes
1273107 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel which will make fantastic olympic footage available where young generations of sports fans are already going for online entertainment
1273108 the olympic games are not that credible or relevant to most young people in the developed or developing world

1273112 klimaschutz energieeinsparungen und umweltvertr glichkeit sind wichtige kriterien f r gesundheit und lebensqualit t wir m chten die b rgerinnen und b rger deshalb ausf hrlich dar ber informieren welche betriebe sich auf diesen gebieten spezialisiert haben
1273113 um zukunfts und wettbewerbsf hig zu bleiben wird es f r handwerksbetriebe deshalb immer wichtiger ihr angebot entsprechend auszuweiten und sich weiterzubilden
1273114 hierbei handelt es sich allerdings erst um den startschuss zahlreiche weitere kooperationen zur optimalen erf llung der steigenden kundenw nsche sind in zukunft f r alle sparten zu erwarten denken wir beispielsweise nur an neue integrierte l sungskonzepte im gesundheitsmanagement im bereich der unfallversicherung oder bei wohngeb ude hausratversicherungen
1273115 f r eine ausbildung im wunschberuf muss man auch mal ber den lokalen tellerrand schauen
1273116 ein wichtiger einflussfaktor bei der ausbildungswahl sind erfahrungswerte des direkten sozialen umfeldes aus eltern freunden und bekannten da diese in neueren berufen noch nicht vorliegen k nnen die ausbildungen noch nicht so popul r sein
1273117 obwohl wir den marktplatz erst vor wenigen tagen offiziell ge ffnet haben werden schon ber 450 ausbildungspl tze aus ganz deutschland angeboten
1273118 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1273119 theres no doubt today that what is happening now is far more profound and will be more prolonged than people thought 12 months ago when the problems first arose
1273120 the important thing is that we are straight with people we are going through a tough time thats likely to continue for a while we are no exception every country in the world is going through this
1273121 i am looking at a number of measures and im not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1273122 its helping people thats important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1273123 there are two problems in relation to windfall taxes one is the principle and one is the practicality two years ago people were calling for a windfall tax on the banks i dont think anyone will be doing that today
1273124 i think the principle of providing certainty and stability especially if you take our energy companies where i want them to be investing in new plant and power stations i think thats very important
1273125 my main focus is on working with them to see how we can help their customers meet the higher bills that they are facing at the moment
1273126 the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1273127 it is very clear to me that provided we can get across to people what we are for and the difference government can make the clear principle of fairness that governs everything we do then we can turn the situation around
1273128 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1273129 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1273130 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems
1273131 the federal housing administration financing needed to keep homes affordable for the majority of americans
1273132 what recent college grads exactly are the forbes people talking about here
1273133 were looking at four suspects that were seen the morning after the incident
1273134 it was very disturbing because if someone could think that then someone could do it
1273135 there are some people who for some reason cut bits and pieces off of living things so it made it very uncomfortable and troublesome
1273136 you kind of wonder what kind of people would find this amusing is it people who might harm an animal given the right opportunity thats what i find disturbing about this
1273137 with the recent cases weve seen i think thats a real reality you do have to really watch your animals for that reason
1273138 im the guy whos almost impossible to piss off unless you mess with my friends or family
1273139 im the guy when everything goes wrong i make it right
1273140 im the guy that when i feel like it ill paint myself up like a clown even if its not halloween and go out in public in broad daylight just cause i wanna freak people out
1273141 im 22 but dont let my age fool you ive lived quite the life so far and still going strong
1273142 ive already travelled most of canada by myself just got the east coast left
1273143 i dont stress out too easily i like to listen to music whenever i can and would like to learn how to play the bass
1273144 if there are kids around im the guy who spends all day playing and spoiling them rotten
1273145 im the guy who brings everyone together to spend a day at the park
1273146 i keep in good shape cause i work my ass off and honestly i just hate fat
1273147 i also plan on starting my own business in the next year or so mainly because i wanna be my own boss
1273148 and hey it beats taking the bus cause its small and i save a lot on gas
1273149 intel is showing its cards but will have to deliver the products that live up to an attractive architecture
1273150 the concept of energy and the flow of that energy in the human body is the core of the current explosion in healing
1273151 as we felt new power flow in as we enjoyed peace of mind as we discovered we could face life successfully as we became conscious of his presence we began to lose our fear of today tomorrow or the hereafter we were reborn
1273152 we had a new employer being all powerful he provided what we needed if we kept close to him and performed his work well established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves our little plans and designs more and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life
1273153 tristemente en otros mbitos de trabajo se est n dando pasos atr s

1273159 existe una cosmovisi n que tiende a relativizar los procesos de violencia pol tica para no considerar la represi n como el basamento de la larga duraci n del r gimen
1273160 ni siquiera es un tema sobre el que los historiadores hayan investigado mucho
1273161 hay aut nticas barbaries por ejemplo tiraron la plaza de toros de badajoz que no fue un campo en s sino el escenario de la matanza de 2 000 personas y ahora es un palacio de congresos donde no pone nada de lo que fue
1273162 hemos tenido las mejores condiciones posibles y todos los nadadores lo han aprovechado mucho
1273163 el nimo del equipo est muy bien y todos tienen ganas de tener una buena actuaci n en los juegos ol mpicos
1273164 la atm sfera que se respira entre los componentes del equipo es muy buena
1273165 ahora s lo falta que compita con su objetivo claro sabiendo lo que quiere
1273166 todav a tenemos que decidir si nada tambi n los 200 metros mariposa

1273177 land trusts can help in keeping farmland more affordable but we need enterprising young farmers interested in growing a healthy diversity of crops for local markets this project has the potential to attract such energy
1273178 having lived here and farmed for over three decades i respect our new pie ranchers efforts to become both part of the legacy and team players in the neighborhood i look forward to working with them

1273182 it makes sense that adecco would look to buy michael page as they are mainly in specialist staffing and this is an area that adecco is wanting to move into
1273183 but michael page could be too big for adecco and could cause problems in terms of the integration
1273184 it is certainly a downward drag on second quarter gdp
1273185 en el ciclismo se nos trata m s injustamente que en otros deportes

1273187 sabemos que el dopaje en nuestro deporte est a la orden del d a es algo con lo que tenemos que convivir de la mejor manera posible
1273188 cuando fue declarado positivo todo el mundo lo puso en letras muy grandes y cuando fue absuelto nadie ha dicho nada una persona pierde su trabajo y no sale en los medios

1273201 estamos expectantes ante estos juegos venimos de disputar el torneo de cincinnati pero aqu en pek n hace verdaderamente calor es muy h medo adem s el tiempo en espa a tambi n es caluroso por lo que los espa oles podemos tener cierta ventaja psicol gica a la hora de afrontar la competici n
1273202 los juegos son una competici n diferente en relaci n a otros torneos es muy bonita de verdad tengo muchos amigos aqu y tienes la oportunidad de coincidir y relacionarte con atletas de otros deportes

1273214 ett f rs k kommer att g ras s snart det klarnar upp
1273215 si gana uno de nosotros sea quien sea todos seremos part cipes de esa medalla
1273216 hay una motivaci n a adida porque al xito personal se a ade el de contribuir al medallero espa ol
1273217 somos cinco que podemos lograr la medalla pero tenemos que trabajar juntos en unos juegos lo importante es contribuir al medallero espa ol aunque a t tulo individual ser a bonito ganar si cualquiera gana una medalla ser de todo el equipo si no fuera yo quien la ganara tambi n me sentir a part cipe de ella
1273218 con cinco hombres es dif cil que ning n pa s controle toda la carrera la clave ser estar lo m s adelante posible en el momento clave
1273219 yo tambi n me defiendo en la media monta a hay una parte dura pero antes hay una parte llana en una carrera de un d a la exigencia es diferente y adem s no hay muchos sprinters
1273220 con cualquiera de los dos estar a satisfecho no tengo oportunidad de elegir me conformo con cualquiera

1273225 emocionalmente el grupo est preparado para hacer frente a un nuevo desaf o
1273226 hemos mejorado cada d a sabemos que no empezamos muy bien pero hemos crecido con los entrenamientos y los ltimos partidos que hemos disputado
1273227 va a ser un torneo muy duro con muchos equipos maravillosos pero trabajaremos para superarlos
1273228 ser dif cil jugar contra los mejores equipos del mundo pero estamos preparados
1273229 tenemos que defender muy duro si queremos revalidar nuestro oro porque hay muy buenos equipos
1273230 hay que entrenar los d as que faltan y trabajar es lo principal
1273231 but i never find it hard to meet a young stud when i want to the number of young guys who fuck older women is growing
1273232 id never taken part in a threesome before but i want to do it again said
1273233 the advantage conferred by prior exposure to a word or situation
1273234 some of the biggest decisions of our life where we live what we do and who we marry are influenced by our first name
1273235 men named lawrence and women named laurie are more likely to become lawyers
1273236 its really difficult to do gender blind hiring you can do gender blind initial screening but the most effective thing would be to make managers aware that they have preconceptions
1273237 when authors names were removed the number that were accepted from women rose well intentioned educated people can have biases that they dont know they have
1273238 visible minorities addressing the challenge of access to employment and integration in the workplace
1273239 they throw away the r sum s of people who are from bad parts of town which are supposed to have arabs or blacks
1273240 when you have somebody whose name is mohammed and he lives in st denis
1273241 you say i wont bother with that one and so they dont even answer them
1273242 a 112 000 employee behemoth that receives 40 000 resumes a year in france alone
1273243 once i found out about my sexuality i wanted to have sex all the time
1273244 just because i love sex doesnt mean i dont like to be treated right
1273245 we were aware that the show would be competing with dragon boat races on espn macau but hijinx of the masses still performed much worse than expected
1273246 anything less than a quarter of a billion viewers is simply unacceptable
1273247 it is fascinating that the happiest of all women are those who are self employed rather than those who work part time
1273248 self employed women can choose what to do and when to do it working full or part time means women must compartmentalize their lives and this makes them stressed its a rush from being mom to worker to mom to wife each day
1273249 if you are not going to use a condom you need to be damn sure your partner has a clean bill of health and you both need to be regularly tested for hiv and other stds

1273255 drill drill drill so that the futures traders will flee
1273256 approval of drilling will frighten the futures traders out of the market and the price will go a long way down
1273257 integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap
1273258 without the support of the americans we would not have accomplished the mission because the british forces had done nothing there
1273259 i do not trust the british forces they did not want to lose any soldiers for the mission
1273260 i was not happy everybody just assumed that because this deal was cut nobody was going in cutting a deal with the bad guys is generally not a good idea
1273261 a coalition force would make a pact with essentially their enemy and promise not to go into their area so as not to get attacked
1273262 maliki and the americans felt the british were morally impugned by the deal they had reached with the militia the british were accused of trying to find the line of least resistance in dealing with the shia militia
1273263 you can accuse the americans of many things such as hamfistedness but you cant accuse them of not addressing a situation when it arises while we had a strategy of evasion the americans just went in and addressed the problem
1273264 that is what we were trying to do but it did not work
1273265 we have made some terrible mistakes in iraq and it is only by talking about them that we will learn from them
1273266 last autumn we made a mistake which was understandable but not excusable a shia prisoner ahmed al fartusi said he could put a stop to the killings we released 120 of their prisoners and withdrew out of town but when we moved out lawlessness took over as 90 per cent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army known to british troops as the jam had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
1273267 as if the problems were more about a few criminal tribes and families than religious groups baghdad thought basra was easy to solve and didnt fully understand the extent of the problem plus the americans with their obligations in mosul and elsewhere believed basra could look after itself it was compounded by having little guidance from above as to whether we were right to accept the deal

1273364 i think its stupid to ban hoods and caps people should be allowed to wear what they want clothes are part of your personality
1273365 i agree with this ban completely where i live there is a lot of crime and gangs wearing hoods and caps are really scary if i am on my own and have to walk past a group of hoodies i get scared
1273366 there are so many rules against teenagers i think adults should let us have some freedom to choose what we wear and what we do theres nothing wrong with hoods and caps its just the fashion at the moment
1273367 my friends and i get scared when we see gangs of hoodies in the street also if they do commit crime its hard to catch them on the cctv because you cant see their faces i think they should be banned
1273368 just because you wear a hood or a cap doesnt mean youre a criminal adults dont understand teenagers dont the police have more important things to do than look for people who are wearing hoods respect for us teenagers please

1273380 i think its really scary that there are so many natural disasters these days there are far more than in the past every time you switch on the news you see places that are flooded or countries in drought im sure its all connected to climate change and global warming
1273381 we so many natural disasters on the news these days that you become immune to them
1273382 the hurricanes and earthquakes that have happened in the past month just prove how unprepared we are for natural disasters its crazy that with all the technology and information available to us nowadays natural disasters still kill so many people they should spend more money on research to develop warning systems for hurricanes floods earthquakes and tsunamis
1273383 you cant prepare for natural disasters as nobody knows when or where they are going to happen its natures way of reminding us that she is in charge and we should respect her a lot more than we do

1273436 excluding and ignoring people such as giving them the cold shoulder or silent treatment are used to punish or manipulate and people may not realize the emotional or physical harm that is being done
1273437 in the past people who were ostracized at work or by a friend could seek support and control through another significant relationship but because people report growing more distant from extended family and relying on fewer close friendships they might lack the support to deal with ostracism
1273438 ostracism is one of the most widely used forms of social punishment and some see it as more humane than corporal punishment as when used in a time out but there is a deeper psychological impact that needs to be taken seriously
1273439 we know that when people are ostracized it can affect their perceptions physiological conditions attitude and behavior all of which sometimes can lead to aggression
1273440 and second you can get away with them if people are physically or verbally abusive they can be punished but its hard to punish someone for not making eye contact or ignoring another person if the person is confronted by asking why are you not talking to me the person can easily deny the accusation
1273441 other workers dont want to make friends or even introduce themselves because that person is not expected to remain with the company for long temporary workers feel ignored and excluded and this can affect their performance in the office
1273442 these shows provide a safe way people can share in this painful experience
1273443 its like riding a roller coaster most people dont like to fall but riding a roller coaster is a safe way to feel like you are falling
1273444 ostracism is present in the animal kingdom and is often used to increase a groups chance for survival by basically excluding the weakest link
1273445 for example if a lion is hurt and holding the pride up then that lion may be pushed away
1273446 this is why time outs work so well when disciplining children

1273478 de vraag is of deze vermindering van milieudruk mogelijk is met behoud van de huidige welvaart en hoe de lasten op een sociaal rechtvaardige manier worden verdeeld dit vraagt om een gedurfde maar tegelijkertijd realistische kijk op vergroening van de economie wat betekent dat voor onze levensstijl wat betekent dat voor onze sociale politiek als vlees en energie steeds duurder worden voor mensen met lage inkomens hoe verhoudt ons ideaal van duurzaamheid zich met het ideaal van internationale solidariteit hoe kunnen we arme landen helpen zich op duurzame wijze te ontwikkelen die visie heeft moralistische trekjes als bepaalde levensstijlen de voorkeur krijgen en andere worden afgewezen dat dilemma is extra groot als wij pleiten voor stringente regelgeving hoe verhouden regelgeving en moralisme zich tot ons vrijheidsideaal

1273485 i was the first jackpot winner i couldnt believe it when my numbers came up on the tv screen on the first night i think most of britain was glued to their telly that night anyway since then my life has never been the same my wife and i decided to build a mansion in the country and we both gave up our jobs we went crazy bought five cars each and went on hundreds of holidays we decided to only buy the best of everything marble floors pure gold taps persian carpets in the end we couldnt finish the house and we had to sell it we lost everything our relationship changed and we split up in fact i havent got any of the money now im back at work and i live in a small flat on my own i wish id never bought that first lottery ticket ive had a taste of the rich life but to be honest i was much happier before
1273486 i work for a charity that runs an after school club for children we were given some money from the lottery fund six years ago and it has made a big difference to us we have moved the club to a bigger building and we built a special room for the children to do crafts and cookery we also built a sports centre so now therere lots of things for the children to do after school when they are waiting for their parents to finish work
1273487 ive bought a lottery ticket every saturday for the past ten years i always play with the same numbers so far ive only won a small prize but im sure that one day ill win the jackpot i cant stop playing now just imagine if one week i dont buy a ticket and my numbers come up ill regret it forever when i go on holiday i have to get my neighbour to buy the ticket for me and i phone her to check she has bought it i guess im addicted but as some of the money goes to charity i dont feel guilty about it
1273488 since the lottery started in 1994 theyve made it easier and easier to play now you can use a mobile phone to play by text message or you can play on line i reckon this tempts people who havent got the money to spare to spend it on lottery tickets its always the poorer people who gamble more anyway they live in the hope that one day theyll win and their lives will improve its all rubbish money cant make you happy

1273509 bookstore owners mostly from independent stores mixed with buyers from small and regional chains kept us busy
1273510 hes coalesced the remainders industry into a serious part of the book business
1273511 we were surprised and delighted that our sales were as strong as in previous years given the state of the economy there seems to be an unspoken consensus that the bargain book business is particularly appropriate in todays economy if retailers ever needed bargain product its now
1273512 we delivered exactly the number of attendees that we had told the vendors to expect almost every vendor said it was a good show especially after the serious decreases in attendance and sales at this years book expo america in los angeles in may and the international christian retail show at orlando fla in july

1273529 if you love someone let them go if they come back theyre yours if they dont they never were
1273530 we come to love not by finding a perfect person but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly
1273531 love one another and you will be happy its as simple and as difficult as that
1273532 we cannot really love anybody with whom we never laugh
1273533 if so many men so many minds certainly so many hearts so many kinds of love
1273534 it is better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all

1273537 i dont like april fools day it makes me a bit nervous i keep thinking someone is about to play a trick on me when twelve oclock passes i feel quite relieved that its finished for another year
1273538 when i was at school april fools day was always good fun we played tricks on each other and sometimes on the teacher in fact one year one of the boys at school put a bucket of water on top of the door and when the chemistry teacher came in he got very wet it was funny but the boy got in big trouble
1273539 april fools day is a great idea its easy to forget the actual date and i always believe everything i read in the newspapers or watch on the tv news i usually believe the big national hoaxes and it always makes me laugh afterwards its good to remind us that maybe we shouldnt always belive everything we hear in the news
1273540 april fools day is fun when youre young i rember putting a plastic fried egg on my dads plate for breakfast as a trick he decided to cut it up and pretend to eat it now i think some of the tricks are a bit silly and people can be a bit cruel playing tricks on their friends
1273541 i hate april fools day last year people at work changed the sugar for salt so we all put salt in our coffee then some joker in the office decided he wanted a day off and he did something to the computers so they wouldnt work it just wasnt funny i had lots to do and we all had to stop working and solve the problem

1273548 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
1273549 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
1273550 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
1273551 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
1273552 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
1273553 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
1273554 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
1273555 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
1273556 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
1273557 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
1273558 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims

1273564 what you did must have been absolutely terrifying for the young girls involved
1273565 it also caused a great deal of distress to parents in the area when they found out what happened
1273566 both offences involved the targeting of young vulnerable girls and using quiet deserted streets to assault or try to kidnap them
1273567 it is significant that in both occasions you were interrupted
1273568 btp has always policed these tube stations but our new team will now spend even more time tackling crime in bucks

1273575 we are currently working closely with the metropolitan police in order to find out the cause of the accident
1273576 surveillance is and has been the basis of all neighbourhood watches in the uk
1273577 it is true that with cctv we are overseen too much but with crime increasing day by day it is an intrusive scheme which one has to live with
1273578 you can care about serious crime and terrorism without throwing away our personal privacy with a snoopers charter
1273579 the law must be reformed to require sign off by judges not self authorisation by over zealous bureaucrats
1273580 we have only used this legislation when it has been absolutely necessary
1273581 residents rightly expect us to take action when we believe that fraud for instance is taking place
1273582 inevitably it is often difficult to investigate without bringing together personal information
1273583 but the legislation is quite clear and we need to be clear why we can access this data

1273593 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing mr stevens said after the meeting
1273594 our forecasts had the australian dollar reaching a peak of parity to the us dollar at the end of the september quarter before depreciating into year end mr grace said
1273595 we now believe the australian dollar has reached a peak early in the september quarter and will be adjusting our forecasts over coming days to reflect that view

1273619 a day in the life of ivan denisovich after this incident id have flushed the book down the bog except that i didnt want a blocked toilet
1273620 hes been dealing with this shoulder problem for a long time
1273621 going in to repair the problem is his best chance now to open up next year feeling 100percent
1273622 the good news is his back feels great and his left shoulder is not a problem
1273623 it seems like those two issues have been addressed going through an offseason last year and rehabbing three different surgeries at once was not easy this time hell be able to focus on just one thing
1273624 anytime you have a player of his caliber youd always love him to be in your lineup
1273625 but looking at him getting this behind him and ready to contribute on a daily basis next year is exciting
1273626 id have to say i enjoy the warm weather a little better than the cold stuff
1273627 my last two years it has seemed to work out that way
1273628 the biggest thing lately is trying to relax and use my hands
1273629 ive gotten to the point where every at bat im trying to make it as difficult as i can for the pitchers to get me out
1273630 it made me grow up as a person and as a player
1273631 it made me appreciate being on the field every day
1273632 obviously hes not going to play tonight and i would think if the symptoms continue its looking more and more like he may not play in this series
1273633 but thats something ill have to tell you hopefully when the game is over
1273634 what it tells you is how tough this guy is
1273635 this guy is something he wants to play and he wants to be out here
1273636 it would be pointless to sit here and be mad over things i cant control
1273637 if jones couldnt play for an extended period of time i would think wed have to get some kind of replacement up here
1273638 i dont think ive even thrown back to back in the second half
1273639 its really tough to find your rhythm ive gone three four and five days off a couple of times now
1273640 mr rudd and mr swan between them over eight months have destroyed business and consumer confidence in the australian economy
1273641 they talked up inflation as being a crisis they delivered higher taxes in the budget and now weve seen petrol and grocery prices increase
1273642 that was always mr rudds plan to slow the economy
1273643 and now the reserve bank is in a position in looking forward where it is so concerned about the state of the australian economy that its forecasting there may be room to reduce interest rates in the future
1273644 we cannot have the hospital downgraded in any manner or means
1273645 this is about the health board not putting in full time members of staff to provide the service that we require in a amp e
1273646 i want a reassurance that they can staff the hospital and they have got a long term commitment to the galloway hospital in stranraer
1273647 i think our record in the past has shown we want to spend money to provide health services in stranraer
1273648 staffing an a amp e department at that distance from a district general hospital is always going to be difficult
1273649 i think it is really important we get highly trained doctors who are going to provide the service

1273658 the success weve enjoyed in 2008 can be directly attributed to the strength of our 40 territories across the u s puerto rico and the hawaiian islands though im a tad biased the numbers certainly bear out that our people are among the best in the business

1273672 any possible weakening in the level of competition in retailing is unlikely to have been a substantial contributor to food price inflation in australian
1273673 the gross margins of coles woolworths and metcash have increased over the last five years however accc analysis indicates that these increases in gross margins could have only made a small contribution to overall food price inflation
1273674 in other words the vast majority of grocery price increases in australia are attributable to other factors such as supply and demand changes in international and domestic markets increases in the costs of production and domestic weather conditions
1273675 not support the proposition that retail prices have risen while farm gate prices have stagnated or declined
1273676 coles and woolworths have maintained a fairly consistent share of supermarkets above 1000 m2 over the last 10 years with each having just over 30 per cent of stores nationally
1273677 coles and woolworths are much more significant in relation to larger stores accounting for around 87 per cent of all supermarkets above 2000 m2
1273678 there is little evidence to suggest that coles and woolworths have simply bought out the competition high concentration levels alone do not dictate the nature of competition there are other markets internationally that are more concentrated but appear to be more competitive
1273679 evidence indicates that if one player attempts to lead prices down the other will follow making it extremely difficult for either one to win significant numbers of customers from the other through an aggressive pricing strategy there is little incentive and perhaps limited capability on the part of coles to upset the existing balance
1273680 the implications of another large scale wholesaler entering the industry are unclear

1273709 oh well that writers just expressing his opinion hes got that right
1273710 he mr rudd said he would do something about the price of petrol he hasnt dr nelson said in sydney
1273711 he said hed do something about the price of groceries the report doesnt do anything about it at all
1273712 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down dr nelson said
1273713 as adults early maturing girls demonstrate lower academic and occupational achievement and report lower relationship quality and life satisfaction
1273714 it is thus important to identify protective factors that may mitigate negative effects of early maturation on girls adjustment
1273715 also early maturation only predicted physical aggression when combined with low maternal nurturance
1273716 as of 4pm today premier has received acceptance instructions which will enable premier to take its relevant interest to 50 18 of all just shares the company said in a statement
1273717 this number includes the relevant interest of premier and its associates in just shares and the number of additional just shares that are the subject of acceptance instructions in the acceptance facility premier said
1273718 the just special board committee has indicated that they will now recommend our offer mr lew said
1273719 as welcome as todays milestone is were not done yet premier is very focused on securing the remaining acceptances necessary so that it can increase its relevant interest in just to 90
1273720 we dont think that the offer is full price for control of just group given its quality as a business but we need to recognise that the shareholders have voted for the takeover dr pollard said
1273721 unit pricing that is that the supermarket giants display uniform product prices by weight
1273722 the accc report identifies many of the structural issues prevalent in the grocery sector but fails to recommend solutions to address the concentration of market power held by the three major participants in the industry
1273723 the acccs decision to conduct further investigations into restrictive leases and site access generally is a positive step
1273724 rational pricing from the major supermarket chains that is no silly price wars growth should still be available from expanding into non food and grog segments such as pharmacy pending legislative changes clothing and other retailing
1273725 with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1273726 the australian domestic economy led by retail sales credit growth and housing has slowed more rapidly than anticipated
1273727 our forecasts had the australian dollar reaching a peak of parity to the us dollar at the end of the september quarter before depreciating into year end
1273728 we now believe the australian dollar has reached a peak early in the september quarter and will be adjusting our forecasts over coming days to reflect that view
1273729 while there are large differences in the australian and new zealand economies it is difficult for the australian dollar to continue to rally when the new zealand dollar is depreciating due an easing cycle
1273730 the market is now more sure the reserve bank is going to cut rates next month and we would have the first easing cycle in seven years
1273731 the reserve bank statement did confirm in my mind a september cut is a given
1273732 all thats left to debate is whether its 25 basis points or 50 basis points
1273733 weighing up the available domestic and international information the board judged that the cash rate should remain unchanged this month
1273734 nonetheless with demand slowing the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1273735 on balance however it is looking more likely that demand will remain subdued and economic growth will be fairly slow over the period ahead
1273736 the reserve bank has over recent weeks become more worried about the growing risk of recession
1273737 a bad day for the resources sector was partially offset by a very good day in the banks

1273748 whether the early settlers were pilgrims puritans or huguenots the story of their flight from persecution is mirrored by their drive to live among people just like themselves the suburbs in the broadest sense are tied to this urge to control and shape our immediate environment
1273749 the chief defect of the housing improvement policy of the city in the 1950s and 1960s was probably the over reliance on public housing and large scale urban renewal clearances these were both necessary but they did not address the problems of the enormous extent of the row house supply that was the main residential resource of the city this aging row house residential fabric held the city together socially and in terms of community life it was declining at a rate that led people to abandon it yet public housing or clearance to replace the worst areas did not capitalize on the old neighborhood stability characteristic of the city nor did it induce widespread conservation and reinvestment in older housing by working people themselves in society hill queen village and fairmount the result of such reinvestment for upper and middle class families could be seen and a delightful center city ambiance was created the same thing never happened for blue collar families and the result was that dozens of neighborhoods continues to decline this condition altered the social character of the city more than all of the ambitious rebuilding projects of the post world ware ii decades

1273762 als je alleen naar de punten zou kijken heb ik het inderdaad beter gedaan dan gubert maar dat is natuurlijk onzin het begin was gewoon erg lastig spelers die plotseling opstapten we zaten met een incomplete selectie nu begint er eindelijk een team te ontstaan er zijn niet heel veel nieuwe spelers gekomen maar wel een aantal erg goeie pini berlin uit israel doet het fantastisch op doel marinus van dortmont en nils deelder voegen ook echt iets toe aan het elftal
1273763 op 18 februari 2008 is na de promotie naar de 5e divisie het masterplan n8 gepresenteerd e n van de speerpunten was om niet te degraderen en vervolgens mee te gaan draaien met de top 3 dat seizoen werden we echter al direct kampioen en zo speelden we plots in de 4e divisie dabbenvanger gaf voor dit seizoen al aan dat dit nog een beetje te vroeg kwam toch begrijp ik wel dat supporters stiekeme hoop hadden dat er meer in zou zitten we zitten nog niet op het niveau waarmee we het deze tegenstanders echt moeilijk kunnen maken
1273764 ach van die dreksen word ik altijd zo moe laat ie lekker achterover in zijn luie stoel verborgen achter een cubaan luisteren naar klanken uit vervlogen tijden er zijn inderdaad een aantal spelers die ouder zijn dan ik die probeer ik ook zoveel mogelijk erbij te betrekken regelmatig heb ik met de spelersraad bestaande uit van der belt alv s berkhout en van dortmont overleg over tal van zaken tevens heb ik als docent op de land en tuinbouwschool veel ervaring op gedaan eigenlijk heb ik ook helemaal geen zin om me hier te verdedigen reken me maar af op de prestaties aan het eind van het seizoen

1273767 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1273768 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew
1273769 it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1273770 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them

1273788 we had heard about captive from other credit union marketers that had either switched from another system to captive or installed the codigo application after reviewing several options
1273789 they reported a very positive experience and i have to echo those comments we have had a productive relationship with captive since installing the first unit in october of last year that experience prompted us to switch more of our branches to captive and we anticipate installing their system in new branch builds over the coming years
1273790 i absolutely recommend captive to other credit unions looking for a digital merchandising system this product is flexible progressive and easy to use

1273804 after meeting dawn and hearing her story as well as learning about the devastating effects of children born with cdh we immediately offered our services in the production of the first cherubs angel ball
1273805 the angel ball was the planting of a seed for a tradition of annual angel balls as well as raising much needed attention and funds for cherubs
1273806 there are many worthy causes but this was an event which we felt compelled to donate our time and resources to we wanted to create an event for dawn and the families with children affected by cdh that was worthy of their passion and commitment toward getting the word out
1273807 signature events was able to take my vision and make it a reality producing an amazing well thought out one of a kind event that completely exceeded my expectations

1273832 i have spent several hours with paula in hospital since last night she is a strong person and is showing good signs
1273833 her recovery will be a long process and she is getting all the support she needs with her family and friends by her side every step of the way
1273834 i saw paula suffer from lethargy confusion a degree of denial and profound sadness almost like grief

1273840 the big problem for israelis in west africa is that there are countries whose diamond industry is controled by lebanese locals a majority of whom openly support hezbollah
1273841 in effect these are countries which are known as hezbollah states
1273842 theyve got bribery and crime the police dont function and the israelis wandering around there are completely exposed and utterly unprotected
1273843 there are muslim countries there pro arab with regard to the israeli palestinian conflict that are a very easy berth for hezbollah activity

1273848 just as the company slowly diversified the ipod lineup and entered lower price points with every new version
1273849 we expect apple to launch new models of the iphone at lower price points in calendar year 2009
1273850 this rumour still doesnt make any sense to me for this year
1273851 taking features out of the current iphone loses 10 or more of revenue for every 1 saved in build costs iphone nano would have to outsell iphone by a large factor 5 10 times the sales to make sense
1273852 a cut down version of the original iphone with the candy bar shape of ipod nano music players would be a huge hit as a christmas gift
1273853 too expensive to be a realistic proposition in the pay as you go market

1273866 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells

1273892 i try not to make a practice out of threatening bloggers with litigation id have more success swatting hornets
1273893 apparently j todd foster of the bristol herald courier is in a bit of a snit over some commentary by swac girl on her blog the thing that concerns me his response to her was the immediate threat of a lawsuit
1273894 the issue that matters for bloggers and editors more broadly is the absolute lunacy of foster s reaction to one of swac girl s recent posts
1273895 having worked in newspapers for many a year i know how journalists think of the jerks whose first reaction to a negative article is to threaten us with a lawsuit
1273896 boy am i an idiot i keep having faith in my brethren and they keep letting me down
1273897 one who or that which is greatly disliked or detested
1273898 but there s a reason that frivolous lawsuits threats are anathema to people who care about the right to free speech
1273899 for a journalist to use such a tactic as his first resort is a disgrace maybe swac girl is wrong maybe she or the blogger she was linking to owe mr foster a correction one thing absolutely is clear 1st amendment dependent newspaper journalist foster has acted without the judgment you d expect from a man with the responsibility of editing a newspaper
1273900 the writing is on the wall for the bhc circulation is falling the bhc paper boxes that lined the roads for years are now disappearing and being replaced by kingsport times boxes the bhc will continue to lose local readership the reason is j todd foster with any luck the powers that be will get rid of him when they do circulation will again grow
1273901 foster throws out a law suit would cost a blogger 200k to defend powerful threat indeed
1273902 i dont know why foster decided to bring out the sledgehammer
1273903 the government is not going to pacify us like this

1273913 saddam is not like the saudi princes who spend the bulk of their lives outside of their country and who fritter away the kingdoms oil profits on prostitutes and bottles of champagne in paris no saddam is building railways creating electrical networks highways and other important elements of a serious state infrastructure after eights years of war against the iranian regime of khomeini he desperately needs to demobilize his republican guard which incorporates so many of this technical elite in order to rebuild his war devastated country these people are his technicians his engineers if they are put to work in the way saddam wishes they will rapidly make iraq the most advanced power in the region and we cannot allow this to happen
1273914 now we can see a new world coming into view a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order
1273915 are these medical need cases from the military bases bush has put in the caspian basin area or combat related injuries
1273916 they are both need for general medical treatment and combat related vehicle accidents non combat injuries major illness combat injuries etc
1273917 interesting i do not seem to recall reading in the news that the us is involved in combat operations in those nations are we talking about black ops
1273918 yes it is almost all black ops in those nations
1273919 how did you know that these troops had been injured in those nations and not say in afghanistan
1273920 because they were angry at what they had been sent to do and they wanted someone to talk to about it as their care providers safe in the hospital late at night they cried they talked they confessed to us what they had been sent to do we are all under orders to shut up not tell the truth but soldier to soldier we talked a lot i heard more than i was prepared to hear due to the horrid extent of the injuries i saw more than i was prepared to see
1273921 why would a tough special ops soldier be crying loss of a fellow soldier loss of a leg or limb or god forbid his genitals or face unrecognizable anymore
1273922 because of what they were sent to do once they figured out what the real mission was
1273923 no they were sent to be the terrorists and it is why they were sent that had them crying some of them were afraid that god would never forgive them and i think they might be right at times there were some attacks on the us soldiers by people who do not want us there and some pay back attacks after us forces had attacked them but for the most part what i was being told about was the us conducting intimidation and terrorism operations against civilians to get their oil and gas
1273924 many of the people in those areas do not like america do not trust america many are competing to get control of areas of land that have or are thought to have vast amounts of oil or natural gas some of it is oil and gas leases some of it pipeline right of way to get it to a port and ship it all over the world
1273925 i know the caspian basin mother lode the idiotic grand chessboard that is why i have been reporting on and researching the caspian basin and the real reasons we attacked afghanistan to steal a pipeline deal from an argentina company have these soldiers been sent in to strong arm threaten terrorize etc with these big oil thugs and things got too hot shooting started
1273926 some times yes but that is not what had many of them upset unless they did lose a fellow soldier or yes they lost a future because of their injuries
1273927 exactly and that is exactly why i contacted you japan china russia and others are over there to sign up the oil and gas leases but the us is the only one i know of that is going in there and terrorizing or killing people to get its way they are using us soldiers to try to force people to sign a contract or kill them and take it from them anyway the truth has to get out about what bush has done and used 9 11 as the excuse to do it these black ops started way before 9 11 they had to get oil and gas leases signed then they had to get the pipeline under control
1273928 many of our soldiers have already figured out that 9 11 was just to get the pipeline they need across afghanistan many of these soldiers know they were used to get the oil and gas leases nailed down so there would be something to put through that pipeline
1273929 the us army or marines cannot tell you the truth lest they want to face court martial and spend the rest of their life in leavenworth as for me i am no longer concerned about making grade to colonel or general i am resigning my commission and getting out of this web of lies and evil i can no longer serve this nation and what it really stands for and what is does and will not tell america im finished
1273930 were you able to determine from any of these special ops soldiers how long such covert operations had been going on prior to 9 11
1273931 yes according to some of them these operations had been going on for up to a year before 9 11 and possibly even longer they had to nail down those oil and gas leases pipeline right of ways because many other nations were after the same oil and gas deals
1273932 the thought just occurred to me how do they explain these injuries or kia of these soldiers who are waging black ops against civilians in nations we supposedly have no ongoing military operations afghanistan
1273933 afghanistan some times if after october 7 2001 or they list them as victims of terrorists without explaining that they were killed or injured conducting acts of terrorism against civilians and a fire fight broke out innocent humans except they were sitting on land with oil and gas under it there were some attacks on us troops as pay back
1273934 did any of these soldiers admit to you how they figured out that someone had ordered them on an illegal mission an illegal order to go process a death warrant on civilians who would not sign a contract
1273935 in april 2001 tommy franks the commander of us forces in the persian gulf south asia area testifies to congress in april that his commands key mission is
1273936 everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers
1273937 equality is a fantasy as far as im concerned males and females are fundamentally different and that means physically and mentally
1273938 girls work harder than boys they get a real buzz from succeeding in the exam system
1273939 i didnt have a male teacher until i was 12 perhaps without realising it at that age us boys thought school was a girls thing
1273940 boys dont like to learn or work hard at school its seen as uncool
1273941 i remember having to write about why animals should not be hurt for my gcse english exam whos likely to perform better in such an exam a caring sensitive female or a macho lad
1273942 we all know that boys mature more slowly than girls it does not mean they are less intelligent they just catch up later
1273943 it might be that there are loads more teachers who are female and who therefore communicate better with girls
1273944 at gcse age most girls can see forward to the next step in education and boys are too busy watching the girls
1273945 from an early age girls are encouraged to take part in
1273946 a number of changes to the way the exam system works have favoured this inequality boys are better at learning events and facts but gcse questions ask more about feelings now boys are better in written exams but girls work hard at home to do the coursework there should not be any coursework in my opinion
1273947 can we just bury this franchise and promise not to dig it up
1273948 were you to watch this film with the volume off it might be a fairly good adventure film
1273949 this is the worst kind of sequel the kind of that reeks of having been made purely for the paycheck its time to seal this mummy back up into its crypt and keep it there
1273950 when a script stoops low enough to involve yak vomit as the focus of a joke that should be a red flag to the studio that it might be a good idea to hold off on production
1273951 my teaching is not my own it comes from him who sent me if anyone chooses to do gods will he will find out whether my teaching comes from god or whether i speak on my own he who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth there is nothing false about him

1273954 our view is that the economy contracted for the second consecutive quarter in june
1273955 the reason we experienced recession earlier than other countries is the drought which we estimate knocked one percent off gdp in the first half of the year hurting farmer production a major contributor to the economy
1273956 it also reduced hydro electricity generation causing some manufacturers to curtail production
1273957 we think the consumer is out for the count for the foreseeable future
1273958 we have been spending more than we earn on the back of rising housing prices it was always going to come crashing down
1273959 the tax cuts coming on october 1 will feed some demand back into the economy the droughts over so expansion should pick up

1273974 update note one of the quotes used on screen in the mccain ad is under dispute
1273975 i have become a symbol of america returning to its best traditions
1273976 not long after bush called james robison a prominent minister and told him ive heard the call
1273977 richard land of the southern baptist convention heard bush say something similar
1273978 i think that god picked the right man at the right time for the right purpose
1273979 why is this man in the white house the majority of america did not vote for him hes in the white house because god put him there for a time such as this
1273980 privately bush talked of being chosen by the grace of god to lead at that moment
1273981 i think president bush is gods man at this hour and i say this with a great sense of humility
1273982 if id won that election in 1992 my oldest son would not be president of the united states of america
1273983 the gop says this dems say that its all so confusing both sides are to blame
1273984 update note one of the quotes used on screen in the mccain ad is under dispute
1273985 well as ms pointed out earlier today this kind of post from him gets more comments and more attention than serious ones
1273986 this is the moment the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
1273987 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin its not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
1273988 i love when im shaking hands on a rope line and i see a little old white lady and a big burly black guy and latino girls and all their hands are entwined and theyre feeding on each other as much as on me its like im just the excuse
1273989 does anybody notice that only republicans and the mccain campaign refer to obama as
1273990 well as ms pointed out earlier today this kind of post from him gets more comments and more attention than serious ones
1273991 why does michael scherer want to devote so much time and effort to making high school gossip level character assassination the center of this campaign when weve got an energy crisis two wars and from all signs an impending major recession or even depression why does michael scherer hate america why does john mccain hate america
1273992 update note one of the quotes used on screen in the mccain ad is under dispute
1273993 a mccain campaign aide described this new web video as a little friday fun hoping desperately that major news outlets will pick this up and air it for free
1273994 any ad mccain runs against that uppity presumptuous negro is ok by me
1273995 may i remind everybody that obama is uppity mccain is just putting him in his place
1273996 i expect some people will think im being alarmist but there is a broad pattern of fairly steep declines in his poll numbers and obamas obviously losing the narrative battle if the democrats wait until the problems are apparent to everyone before fighting back it will be too late
1273997 but you hit the page and there he is and i for one cant help reading and smug privileged pasty faced lickspittles to power just irritate the hell out of me
1273998 doctor rusty i actually agree with you in that rose at her core feels that bho has no credibility and so for her and you she did miss that point
1273999 i expect youre being a troll a really sophisticated surprisingly literate troll really rose im impressed youre so adept at leaning right while triangulating that i would say you must work for or get all your information from some establishment media outfit
1274000 i guess i didnt get the memo from the dnc that says were not allowed to be pessimistic anymore
1274001 if you sense that i dont like obama as much as you do youre probably right
1274002 rose my thoughts about you are only based on reading your comments here nothing intuitive involved
1274003 rose at her core feels that bho has no credibility
1274004 but rose has been elevating everyone else including mccain today and denigrating obama for no apparent reason and under the cover of helpfulness for as long as she has been posting here
1274005 what is obama talking about those two women are white
1274006 and an aside to rose cliff pnnto acid j and others please note how easy it is for dissension to be sewn within the ranks of allies there is no need for commentors to accuse one another of being a concern troll when we have actual living and breathing conservative wingnut trolls posting on this board
1274007 what is obama talking about those two women are white
1274008 a noun a verb and obama thinks hes so cool
1274009 i am happy that he draws crowds but understand that those people like those in germany wont vote and wont decide i have said that it is good to a point but at some time it needs to be toned down it is just an intuitive thing with me that i know american voters will be a little turned off by it
1274010 but now that hes back in the us he needs in my humble political newbie opinion to figure out how to push back against mccains low substance gambit
1274011 and that really is what has driven me from the gop
1274012 bet he feels dirty all over dont make him rehash those awful memories
1274013 oh you mean the time that he graduated from harvard law school and instead of taking a lucrative position in a big city law firm he decided to return to one of the most down trodden areas of the country in order to help the people who lived there
1274014 the time he founded and managed all of those many foundations
1274015 the time he helped with civil rights legislation and neighborhood economic development or his time in the illinois state senate where he helped to work against predatory lending worked for increased subsidies for child care worked to reform ethics and health care laws the guy is obviously some kind of monster
1274016 help save child care worked to reform ethics and health care laws
1274017 this is exactly the kind of campaign that helps americans decide issues
1274018 another way to look at that ad is that it exposes the sheer incompetence of the mccain campaign
1274019 gee i wonder why if you have a black man running for high public office
1274020 he was offered early release and he told em to shove it
1274021 he has been there hes done that hes been miserable hes been tortured beaten to a pulp and yet he still comes up with that patented mccain smile
1274022 the only reason i am here today is because i believe a higher being has a mission for me and my life
1274023 some people dont like the idea of a president who is declared immune to criticism by the blackmail of accusing the critics of racism
1274024 mccain is more humble giving week end radio addresses and envisioning what america will look like in 2013 after his first term
1274025 also resort to their 3rd grade playground name calling if that will not suffice
1274026 the idea that a n r can be president is as absurd as the idea that obama is the savior of the world
1274027 go have your watermelon boy and let the real americans run the country into the ground
1274028 i have become a symbol of america returning to its best traditions
1274029 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1274030 anytime race is the topic du jour in the campaign its a bad day for obama period
1274031 obama may be the one but is he ready to lead
1274032 ana marie cox is appearing on reliable sources with african american conservative deroy murdoch both agree with the framing that barack obama stating that he doesnt look like the images dollar and five dollar bills is labeling the mccain campaign as racist
1274033 who the heck are these hcd research and muhlenberg college i mean seriously
1274034 ana marie cox is appearing on reliable sources with african american conservative deroy murdoch
1274035 i do agree that obama benefits whenever these fake or not race controversies it reinforces to the point of mythology the idea that this election is a national referendum on whether or not were all racists
1274036 in late june a mccain ad superimposed obamas visage on a one hundred dollar bill as part of an effort to mock obamas supposed presumptuousness
1274037 while the guilt that in total cause the current deficit
1274038 the democrat controlled congress is just as guilty esteemed democrat congressmen and women
1274039 fiscal discipline taxes to pay off the debt at that time
1274040 this was a time our country on our own soil
1274041 now we are going to fight to keep not only our own country safe but the world at large from these extremists
1274042 eventually they will be at our un protected and un defended borders and we can fight them in our own streets
1274043 obamas economic plan he also wants to raise our taxes through non wage tax means
1274044 or are you betting on social security to keep you in your
1274045 in an obama plan you will on a social security only type of retirement plan
1274046 mccain on the other hand wants to allow our free market economy continue to expand with a limited government influence
1274047 if you want to lay blame on the bush administration oops you are right now they didnt
1274048 i am not a stupid person they were telling me how to vote
1274049 i suppose its nice that someone can point out the obvious to the dimwitted fools in our press corps
1274050 it almost seems as if rusty is attempting to portray the stereotypical horrible conservative
1274051 obama is dealing the race card and from the bottom of the deck
1274052 first off harvard amp these state of the world ecology

1274083 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1274084 it was an incredible moment when we realized the figures we were getting in they had not been previously recorded because these are very remote areas that are quite inaccessible and logistically tough to survey
1274085 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time

1274145 the weather is still bad flying in skardu and beyond was not possible this morning normally it takes two or three days to improve the weather in the area
1274146 our helicopters are ready waiting for an improvement in the situation they may try to make an attempt this evening if the weather improves even for a few hours
1274147 such missions are quick it may not take more than one or two hours to bring the climber down

1274154 both flying pigeons and kites have been a severe threat to the safety of planes coming out of the airport in order to strengthen the sky clearance certain areas have banned kite flying to avoid potential danger
1274155 theres not much potential danger in flying kites so long as you dont play along the roads where there are high electricity wires
1274156 we dont want to lay out our cards before the hearing
1274157 it just seems futile trying to argue why the tackle was a grade one without being able to use similar tackles to highlight our point
1274158 im sure hes been under great pressure from the labor party and some others to be a candidate
1274159 his record has certainly been one of supporting quite a lot of labor party activities in the state parliament
1274160 it was noticeable when the flirtation with the liberal party happened over the last few weeks people came up to me or into the office and said please dont do that
1274161 and as well the opportunity of working with government from a community perspective you need to have access for outcomes
1274162 the luxury weve got for this by election is that we know who the government of the day is for the next five years wed be nuts to put ourselves back into the opposition
1274163 australia needs independents in the parliament to provide balance and to ensure the best possible outcomes for the people of australia and particularly those in country areas
1274164 ive been waiting for you on my own for over an hour i felt like a real
1274165 he watches tv for three hours every day hes such a couch
1274166 i was so embarrassed i turned as red as a
1274167 that guy is hes driving way too fast through the town centre
1274168 that lady has a very posh accent it sounds like shes got a in her mouth
1274169 she didnt panic at all she was as cool as a
1274170 he really knows his when it comes to computers hes really knowledgeable
1274171 in 1992 only one person in 237 used one in 2002 one person out of every 5 used one what do you think it is
1274172 i couldnt live without my mobile phone i think im addicted to it in fact make over twenty phone calls a day and send at least forty text messages i just like to be in touch with all my friends i cant really remember what my life was like before i had my mobile i wouldnt give it up for all the money in the world
1274173 i have a mobile but i try not to use it too much when i do have to use it for a long time i worry about whats happening to my brain sometimes my ear gets really hot and i get a headache im sure its not good for you to use a mobile for long periods of time we all use them but there hasnt been much research into the possible dangers
1274174 i think theyre really useful its great to be able to call a mate and tell him youll be a bit late to meet him the other day my car broke down on the motorway and it was great to be able to phone for help i got lost on the way to a friends house the other day and she told me the directions as i was walking along that was really handy
1274175 i have never had a mobile phone i work from home im a writer so i really dont need one i have to phone friends on their mobiles though and my phone bill has gone up lots since everyone started using mobiles my girlfriend keeps trying to convince me to get one but i wont people think im a bit strange not having one but i dont want people to be able to know where i am and what im doing every minute of the day i like to be un contactable
1274176 i have a phone but im really careful about switching it off when im in public places i hate having to listen to other peoples conversations on the train and on the bus i try not to listen but its impossible when people speak loudly often they have really personal conversations and i just dont want to know their private business it can be embarrassing i think they should be banned in restaurants art galleries and on public transport the whole mobile phone culture is out of control and we shouldnt accept it its noise pollution
1274177 im a teacher in a secondary schools and mobile phones really annoy me the students send text messages to each other in the class and last month i caught two of my students cheating in an exam by sending messages to each other in theory they are not allowed to bring them to school but its nearly impossible to stop them i dont think parents should buy them for their children its crazy to see eleven year olds with their own mobiles it must cost a fortune for their parents too
1274178 im a bit of a phone fanatic i always want to have the latest model i now have one of those phones that takes photos its great when youre out partying you can take photos of pretty girls in the bars and send them to your mates we have such a laugh taking photos of people when they dont know once i saw my sisters boyfriend out with another girl so i took a photo of him and this other girl and sent it to my sister that was the end of that relationship i never liked him much anyway
1274179 i think that david beckham wants to show everyone that his sons and his wife are the most important people in his life
1274180 la diffusion din rainbows nous a appris que le plus important sont les gens qui aiment notre musique notre relation avec eux le fait quon peut leur parler directement quon peut partager notre musique avec eux
1274181 en m me temps nous travaillons toujours avec les m mes personnes chez emi et parlophone

1274184 lun des groupes de rock les plus importants des 15 derni res ann es
1274185 it taught us that the most important thing is the people who like our music our relationship with them
1274186 the fact that we can talk to people we can share our music with them in concert on cd and on the internet it can all be part of the same thing it doesnt have to be so mediated by going through a traditional record company
1274187 at the same time were still working with the same people at emi and parlophone
1274188 if youre talking about canada were very grateful for the work from emi canada for all our records
1274189 it was really fun they took us up to their
1274190 they came and saw both shows they took me ed and phil to see some
1274191 we talked to r gine and win about life and touring it was really cool it relates to what i said earlier about how its important to be in one place and space it would be mad otherwise if you didnt connect to the places where you were touring
1274192 more confused than inspired things started to take shape when we started recording in this studio in oxford we recorded two songs 15 step and weird fishes arpeggi and compiled everything around there we managed to get the backing tracks relatively quickly the songs themselves before we recorded them were inspired it was about getting the right emotional and rhythmic measure
1274193 we played the shows and went in to the studio thinking we could record them as
1274194 today were going to talk about x what do you think
1274195 today we are going to talk about pollution and this will be useful for you because you can try using your words structures from the last lesson etc

1274197 you must have gone to the cinema on friday and you might have gone with your boyfriend

1274199 does anyone know if there is a bank open on saturday here
1274200 does he have a long lie in at the weekend
1274201 youve got to make sure you command the respect of your players and not demand it
1274202 im sure kevin will give a speech talk to players individually talk to them as a squad and i dont see there being too many problems first up
1274203 him and andrew flintoff are the two biggest names in that england team and theyve got to make sure they work for each other andrew will play for kevin as much as he plays for england
1274204 i respect michaels decision to take a few weeks off
1274205 i believe he is still a fantastic batter one of the best batters weve got in this country
1274206 hell go back into county cricket without any stresses or strains and hell score as many runs as he can and im sure michael will be back in this england team
1274207 kevin pietersen now stands at a crossroads in his life as well as his career
1274208 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
1274209 within the game worldwide he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone
1274210 hopefully his captaincy will be similar to his batting positive instinctive and entertaining
1274211 kevin has got to play the way he wants to play look at his stats he is better than anyone in the side so why would you change let him go and do his thing
1274212 he is a fine player he has got confidence by the bucketload and he will probably take that into his captaincy the one thing we dont want is for him to change
1274213 he averages 50 odd with the bat in both forms of the game and he is an unbelievable talent
1274214 concentration concentration concentration now beginning are you ready if so lets go
1274215 my favourite colour is blue what question do you need to ask to find out this information
1274216 what do you think laurent do you agree with serge
1274217 i like them too have you got their latest cd
1274218 i think the price of everythings gone up because of petrol i always try to buy things when they are on sale or try to buy in bulk because its cheaper especially for things like nappies and rice
1274219 the cost of fruit and vegetables has definitely gone up i think maybe if they had discount stores for groceries people would go there to buy cheaper things but i dont really know what else they could do to make food cheaper
1274220 things like toiletries and deodorant have gone up its only ten cents for each thing but it really adds up fruit and vegetables have gone through the roof they say its all to do with water and fuel i dont know what they could to make things cost less maybe they should give them to us for free
1274221 groceries are more expensive fruit vegetables and bread everyone blames it on the drought so im not really sure what would help make things cost less
1274222 the two basic things bread and milk have definitely gone up in price realistically i think everything goes up when fuel prices go up theres not much that can be done about it
1274223 but what i do know is that this is not what i wanted my high school experience to be
1274224 people tend to talk about sex all the time in high school kids talk about sex they talk about emotions they have a lot of held in things just like my character does in the show

1274226 more money is spent on them than going to the cinema or renting videos britain is the third biggest market in the world for them and one european country greece has banned them completely what are they

1274228 you may kill a thousand people on the screen in 4 hours of play

1274231 il non aver differenziato i centri di entrata rispetto a quelli di spesa con laggravante dei trasferimenti statali legati alla spesa storica e non ai costi standard ha determinato non solo unesplosione della spesa pubblica ma anche il venir meno della trasparenza della resposanbilizzazione di chi amministra e del controllo democratico da parte dei cittadini sui propri amministratori nonch un aumento dellevasione fiscale con il modello di federalismo fiscale che io ho proposto e la conseguente autonomia impositiva dei comuni degli enti locali e delle regioni tutto questo non potr pi accadere non solo perch il popolo potr controllare il sindaco e gli altri amministratori su come vengono utilizzati i suoi soldi e per il livello di prestazioni che viene offerto ma anche perch sar proprio il sindaco che pu ben controllare i cittadini di cui conosce benissimo i livelli di vita il primo ad essere interessato a fargli pagare il giusto delle tasse e una volta emerso il nero locale da questa emersione ne trarranno beneficio anche a livello regionale e nazionale per cui questo mio modello di fedralismo fiscale far s che a pagare le tasse saranno veramente tutti e che quindi tutti ne pagheranno di meno

1274278 we will have to reflect with calmness and tranquility on the future of the olympic torch relay
1274279 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1274280 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1274281 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1274282 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1274283 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame

1274295 youve got declining home prices very tight credit conditions a soft jobs market and a weak stock market the consumer has got a lot to deal with

1274298 the benefit of screening at this time is uncertain and if there is a benefit its likely to be small

1274323 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in garments of fine linen and put a gold collar about his neck
1274324 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son who is born you shall throw into the river and every daughter you shall let live
1274325 and joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm his father
1274326 and these are the names of the sons of israel who came to egypt
1274327 but god made me joseph a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt

1274412 those responsible for checking on her safety seemed to think she must be fine as long as she was alive even if she was sitting alone in a stroller in a dark room all day wasting away
1274413 the actions or inactions of these supervisors might arguably be considered criminal
1274414 the grand jury has decided however to focus its criminal charges on those individuals who were most directly involved in danieals neglect and death
1274415 a share of the stain of responsibility for danieals death remains on their hands

1274474 its no longer jennifer and elizabeth have been murdered but theres nothing we can do about that they dont care about jennifer they dont care about elizabeth they only care about saving jose medellin

1274510 you know what mr hamdan had agreed to do and you know how we squandered that opportunity
1274511 the leader of al qaeda himself hosted a wedding feast for the accused this shows just how close he was to the very top of this terrorist conspiracy
1274512 not one witness said he had any role in the terrorist attacks themselves
1274513 we are sending out requests to outlets and shops to pull the games off their shelves and we will replace them with other games
1274514 he said he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1274515 im sorry that i caused so much embarrassment for my family the school and the football program
1274516 im thankful for the opportunity to be out here it was very difficult being away from the school and the football team that i care so much about im blessed to have this chance
1274517 were still evaluating him i have a long history of giving guys opportunities a lot of thought went into it though
1274518 the guys that we do have i know theyre going to work hard and compete
1274519 we have a couple of freshmen that came in that are pretty good and weve got a couple of guys that were already here that know safety and are doing pretty good
1274520 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1274521 im not much of an athlete i eat a lot of mcdonalds
1274522 i finally pulled my head out of my rear it took a while to adjust to the from canada its practically still winter there people are still ice skating
1274523 he sent a letter with a very good very fair and very strong statement that he considers this medal unfairly won and before the ioc takes a decision he handed the medal back to the ioc
1274524 two others of his team mates have indicated they would do so but we are not yet in the possession of their medals
1274525 the humiditys quite fun its like rowing through a steam room
1274526 wed been told it was absolutely terrible so we were prepared for much worse its actually not that heavy today were breathing fine
1274527 we have drastically changed the bodies of some of the guys joe thomas and c j davis have both lost more than 30 pounds
1274528 i love the way our football team looks were a lean and very athletic group right now what we were shooting for
1274529 offensive line coach tony wise had an interesting observation he comes here from coaching with the jets against all those all pros and were going through spring practice and the best players in our conference that we have to block not that the steelers have to block have all been guys who are athletes that can run
1274530 we took this another step and said weve got to be able to match up with these guys a 6 foot 5 guy that is an athlete who can move and is 320 there arent many like that so what can we do how can we match up against them counter that thats how we started the ball rolling
1274531 our middle guys are very solid and we have a lot of talent at tackle but we have to work out our starters there
1274532 we went through that last year in atlanta with michael vick the media and on tv and people outside may think its a distraction but us as players weve got to come out here and practice were not talking about that on the practice field
1274533 each person who has a job being focused to do it so everybody else can depend on him and they are accountable for it
1274534 i knew they werent just signing me and that was it i knew they were going to bring young guys in thats a part of the nfl youve got to go out there and do your job
1274535 i missed a lot on ir but it was nothing too serious im feeling good right now so im ready to go
1274536 has had a lot of different responsibilities for us in the kicking game playing both corner and safety defensively
1274537 hes got good experience in a couple different systems so i dont think anything he is doing here is anything that new
1274538 he shows up with a play or two every day and he is a hard working guy
1274539 it was pretty tough because you couldnt get a hold of anyone back there
1274540 that was probably the hardest thing not knowing for like four or five hours not knowing anything and just doing a lot of praying
1274541 eventually he got hold of my mother and then they called me
1274542 he sent a letter with a very good very fair and very strong statement that he considers this medal unfairly won and before the ioc takes a decision he handed the medal back to the ioc
1274543 two others of his team mates have indicated they would do so but we are not yet in the possession of their medals
1274544 bobbys an athletic guy that has had success rushing the quarterback
1274545 as we all know weve got to affect the quarterback more with our front four than we did a year ago weve got to be able to put some pressure on that guy and disrupt his timing and when you look at bobby and look at sedrick inside those two guys are going to help you
1274546 when you start with a new team you have something to prove
1274547 you dont want to keep dwelling on what youve done in the past if you just come in lackadaisical theyre going to feel like youre a bust and you dont want to have that on your shoulders
1274548 they think im probably just a slim defensive end thats just going to try to give you speed but im going to give you variety
1274549 i can mix it up i can beat you inside beat you outside i might run through you youve just got to be ready for it
1274550 my whole goal for him was hes got to show me golf is the most important thing in his life
1274551 and the most important thing in his life is getting drunk
1274552 i had rib surgery two months ago i just had a cyst in my right hand and they finally got that out now ive got tendinitis in my left elbow
1274553 it feels a little strange a little awkward throwing the ball a little bit
1274554 but it feels good to get back out there when you throw the ball its not coming out like it used to so i have to get reacclimated to how i used to do things
1274555 obviously ben is so up on the no huddle and the terminology and its going to take kellen a little time to catch up on that especially the terminology
1274556 once the play begins he knows where to go and what to do but its that terminology part that will take some time
1274557 i want to show that ive become a better individual and will stop making selfish decisions which is what got me into this in the first place
1274558 i had to grow up as a student not just as an athlete
1274559 he brings maturity hes a hardworking guy and he carries a lot of respect in the locker room i think the experience hes had the last couple months playing pro baseball has to make you more competitive and a better athlete
1274560 when i saw him win his bronze medal on television i really wanted to work hard to feel the same emotions myself
1274561 it was not easy finding my way until 2000 i felt he was better than me to beat him was like a sacrilege
1274562 now of course i share every one of my medals with him
1274563 i dont want to live these games with my eyes shut just to make sure my 90 seconds race will be a success
1274564 thirty seconds before the start i want to take a chance to look at the stands and the scenery to keep memories and tell my family about them later
1274565 this is a tragedy for the athlete this kind of suspicion not just in cycling but any sport its bad and it can distract from a desired result
1274566 we believe him we have faith but who knows maybe in the technical data something will show up
1274567 he spent a lot of time at altitude and his body was attuned to elevation where there is less oxygen that alone has the effect of changing blood indicators but all we can do now is wait and follow procedures
1274568 one doping instance and everything we earn in the olympics could be wiped out i ask you to take maximal control and get maximum guarantees that international cycling officials have no pretences in the gusev affair against our athlete
1274569 its disappointing that they are not going to be there
1274570 i was looking forward to playing them but i am sure they will be back at the next games
1274571 we are feeling good the lead up has been really good
1274572 its very sad that they hockey team are not here
1274573 wir nehmen dieses ergebnis mit bedauern zur kenntnis wir sind umso berraschter weil baldini h ufig kontrolliert wurde und diese tests immer negativ waren
1274574 wer gedopt ist wird nach hause geschickt wir werden unnachgiebig sein es sind junge athleten aber sie haben die werte des sports verraten
1274575 ich habe nichts genommen ich habe zwar keine beweise aber es k nnte zum beispiel etwas in eine flasche getan worden sein
1274576 ich bin berrascht mit so etwas habe ich berhaupt nicht gerechnet das ist schlecht f r den fechtsport
1274577 however i would not have wanted to have those four gold medals right now and have the eyes of the world thinking trinidad and tobago is a place where its ok to cut corners the reputation of my country was a lot more important to me than any medal and cheating
1274578 what bothers me most about it is the resignation and the attitude of a lot of the public that its just part of sport today
1274579 we need to get over that because its not ok its more than just cheating its the future of sport not just the livelihood and dreams of the athletes
1274580 i want to be absolutely clear we cant guarantee it
1274581 the mdc will not accept any deal that denies tsvangirai executive powers
1274582 the talks would rather collapse or not move forward unless mugabe is offered a ceremonial post or forced to retire
1274583 we have said if mugabe refuses to give in we will just say go ahead and govern
1274584 this will definitely create a lot of troubles for the peace process and for the security in darfur
1274585 and i think that the african union commissioners and the peace and security council according to their statements that this will hinder and create a lot of troubles for the peace process and also will create troubles even for unamid in darfur
1274586 all that sudan has done is to put its case to the au and i think that the critics who think that when it suits their interests the au should ignore its interests in order to let the interests of the critics prevail is unrealistic
1274587 the number does not exceed 1 000 they are those who staged riots
1274588 the trade in people is a crime that humanity has witnessed and suffered from for centuries and it is still being practiced in a new way till today
1274589 we have presented a draft law to criminalize human trafficking it will be a civilized law to meet international demands
1274590 the business of art collecting swimming against the invisible economy is rich and strange but value of authenticity is as strong as any currency
1274591 no cork sniffer would be caught dead with a box of wine
1274592 wow who would have guessed the italians would become shy about their women s breasts they have gone rococo loco
1274593 ich bin zufrieden mit der vorbereitung und will mich weiter empfehlen
1274594 ich wei nur dass sie interesse an mir haben mehr m chte ich dazu nicht sagen
1274595 as a law abiding israeli citizen i accept my countrys laws which allow me to build my home here
1274596 as a religious jew i also have a duty to settle here
1274597 this land was promised to us by god and that promise is now being fulfilled
1274598 i think the plan is to put pressure on him to leave this area
1274599 if he cant build a simple house and is not allowed to use the water he wont be able to grow crops and will have no income
1274600 we will pick items for the package in line with the prime ministers policy such as structural reforms and maintaining fiscal restraint
1274601 but its very important to be ready to use whatever means available to achieve the target and we hope to meet it
1274602 won with audacity and wisdom from a tactical and strategic point of view the storm was a magnificent and clean victory there is no dilemma there
1274603 there were dishonorable events after the storm that is unacceptable and croatia will bring to justice all those who are responsable for acts committed after
1274604 it feels great to take part in this event this requires patience and concentration from everyone we want to show our good side so that people will remember us
1274605 we will try to go as far as we can
1274606 we will do our best and this may well be a medal
1274607 they filled us with joy but from now on they must work even harder to become successful as men
1274608 we need immigrants who are able to hit the ground running
1274609 it is our pleasure to jointly present with spreadtrum the td900 the innovative mobile tv equipped td handset to china mobile td900 is designed to address the needs of the mainstream market and is developed independently and to bring us the latest digital mobile tv experience being the national industry leader lenovo mobile will make its best efforts to unite the industrys strengths and advance the development of chinas 3g technology

1274613 these can save someones life so its not a laughing matter
1274614 the prime ministers office have managed to offend one of the great artists of liberty
1274615 high oil prices above 125 a barrel drove prices of primary inputs used in production higher and also affected transport costs
1274616 the united states will video tape and sound record the interviews between representatives of your government and the detainee s named above
1274617 if videotapes were made they were likely used for translators to transcribe and or for intelligence officers to clarify their notes after the fact
1274618 the pollution here is going to be the equivalent to will athens be ready
1274619 people are friendly weather great everything seems to be working
1274620 its a matter of putting your head down and doing your job and thinking positive day in and day out
1274621 were focusing on our direction for the future and feeling good about whats in store
1274622 not just heritage and muscle cars and history but forward thinking about where gm will be going
1274623 we used gmnext as the communications hook for the whole event
1274624 we went through our plans for the future brand by brand and included some pretty confidential reveals and disclosures about future products
1274625 discussion about the company and the significance of 100 years
1274626 gm particularly in china has a terrific brand image and i think 100 years contributes to that and to our presence in china
1274627 its been exciting to see how folks across the globe are embracing the gmnext philosophy and applying it to whats appropriate for their culture and their business
1274628 its a forward looking and optimistic spirit thats really refreshing
1274629 but here people think in terms of dynasties that last centuries
1274630 this is the plan i think i want will it work for me in my situation
1274631 today millions of men around the world wear skirts like the sarong in asia or the djellaba in africa without being bothered
1274632 i thought what do i do to get it out i got both wings back in the right position then it showed me its legs were working and it managed to crawl out
1274633 it frightened us both to find out that well be alone in a cabin
1274634 all deans done for the last two weeks is lie flat on his back
1274635 hes getting bedsores hes got a rash all over his body and he cant move his legs
1274636 well just wait im delighted with the squad ive got brett did fantastic for us hes fitted in very well

1274642 gt dont put all your eggs in one basket its a mantra that comes up time and time again b
1274643 to have him fit again has a calming influence on the team because hes a key player for us
1274644 we already have the gold medal right now and that gives us extra motivation to defend it
1274645 were playing well and have had some strong practices so were going to be ready were getting better and better every day were in a very positive mood
1274646 there is no extra pressure on us because were the champions
1274647 we know we have to play well the u s and spain are the best two teams in the world and if we want to win gold we know we have to go through them
1274648 the last two major international tournaments the u s finished third we play a bit more european like spain with the tough defence and fast break than the nba style the u s play but i think we can beat both of them
1274649 i dont think ive enjoyed sculling as much as i have this year
1274650 we were very pleased with what we did in europe but i really treat those european results with caution
1274651 i just know there are two or three crews that youre just not going to see until the last part of the olympic final its how it is they perform poorly in the early regattas and then they always come up for the big one
1274652 touch wood ive done everything i can and im confident that ive managed the problem i didnt actually know if id have a second life and row so im feeling somewhat privileged to be back
1274653 we think were getting close to what we want now
1274654 clearly we know now it wasnt the suit that was causing all these world records to be broken in 1976 it was copious amounts of steroids
1274655 can the suit technology distract from another issue i think its pretty convenient for those indulging in another issue
1274656 back when i was making 1 200 a month as a professional swimmer and that was it i always argued that more money should come into the sport and always was an advocate of professionalizing the sport
1274657 doping in the sport could potentially make us yearn for those good old days where 1 200 a month was the plight of the swimmer and not the decision to have to take performance enhancing drugs to compete with some of the worlds best
1274658 he has a right to voice his opinion im glad he speaks out if he feels he needs to
1274659 were a sport that has to overachieve to get recognition
1274660 were moving into a lot of new and prosperous territory
1274661 some people dont like that hes outspoken even if he has the best interests of the sport in mind
1274662 i think a lot of people tune him out me personally im glad a guy like gary is out there i want a clean sport if he wasnt talking about doping i dont know how much wed hear about it
1274663 ive been on deck all year and i think the americans are clean
1274664 shes inducted into the international swimming hall of fame and the u s olympic hall of fame and marion jones goes to jail
1274665 the only difference was that marion jones admitted it but they were both on the same list
1274666 i need to prove that a 40 year old is doing this clean and doing it the right way and now if anyone questions me there is nothing else i can do
1274667 i have given myself out there i have done blood tests urine tests anything that they want to test i have agreed to do
1274668 unfortunately there have been athletes who have sat there in the past and looked everyone in the eyes and said i am not taking drugs now they are in jail or indicted or whatever and you are now guilty until proven innocent thats why i stepped up and asked to be tested i could sit here and say i am not doping but i have to prove it now and thats why i have done this
1274669 what other sports have shown is that the more money you put into a sport the more somebody might have to lose and the more someone might start swimming for money
1274670 i dont think we will ever have a clean sport the testers can only find what they are looking for and there will always be people in this world for whatever reason money fame will always find ways to cheat and be ahead of everyone else ive coached for over 30 years and we live with this all the time
1274671 it has grown by leaps and bounds with the momentum of phelps it should continue to grow like that as long as the sport can maintain its shine the worst thing imaginable would be to have something like marion jones happen in swimming
1274672 i dont cringe when gary talks about doping in the sport
1274673 i respect what gary is saying we would be naive to say there is no doping in the sport i dont look at what has happened since the balco era as an overhang either i look at it as a spotlight i look at it as a healthy thing
1274674 the discussion about it the revelations that have come out the fact that there is more testing in other sports outside of olympic sports its not just an olympics issue its a sports issue
1274675 id have to say i enjoy the warm weather a little better than the cold stuff
1274676 my last two years it has seemed to work out that way
1274677 the biggest thing lately is trying to relax and use my hands
1274678 ive gotten to the point where every at bat im trying to make it as difficult as i can for the pitchers to get me out
1274679 it made me grow up as a person and as a player
1274680 it made me appreciate being on the field every day
1274681 all this is now over we start with the euroleague as our target but i cannot say when we will attain it

1274688 no other commodity has a five thousand year history and it is indeed the king of commodities gold has not lost its charm as an investment option so far
1274689 we already have six shubh stores and 30 laabh stores the target is to open 100 shubh stores and that will be achieved by next year only the project has been delayed due to lack of public response and volatility in gold prices in recent times
1274690 however the company has not suffered any losses and we plan to build on our core strength of being an integrated gold manufacturing company
1274691 as a business group we need to invest our resources profitably and real estate is one such opportunity

1274695 you fool the vengeance for your sacrilege will not be exhausted against you but it will be carried out on your child wait and see
1274696 while i of course do not countenance the harassment of anyone by religious nuts i also have something of a baleful view of the kind of self conscious atheist who regards it as a good use of his time to spend the day winding up the god squad while i am perhaps the last person on earth who is well placed to tell anyone else that winding people up for the sake of it is a really silly and childish thing to do well winding people up for the sake of it is a really silly and childish thing to do and furthermore dawkinsite militant atheists are as annoying as fundies in their own way and perhaps deserve a bit of winding up too and so it is that at some point this weekend i plan to tell a small credulous child about whom i will provide no other information that a rainbow is a special sign from god that he promises never to flood the world again and that this proves that god exists
1274697 i think dsquared has outdone himself on this one step one hypocritically look down on those who have a go at others for the sake of it step two brazenly imitate this behavior its times like these that i realize that i can never really measure up in the area of being a pretentious sarcastic wise ass its almost enough to make me give it all up but im not sure my friends and family could bear the loss
1274698 the fact that you can generate such a reaction merely by claiming you plan to do something which is in the final analysis totally harmless says a lot about the new atheism
1274699 three days later they remembered 40 percent of the myths as factual
1274700 this makes me wonder that if all the work on the science communication side of things was counter productive and it reinforced the concept that there was a problem with the mmr vaccine
1274701 found that when accusations or assertions are met with silence they are more likely to feel true
1274702 one obvious lesson is for the media they need to get their science right before they begin their campaigns

1274750 a lot of people realised that point to point was going to be a big problem even for telephones even before they thought about computers
1274751 the problem was how you turn it away from that
1274752 there were other ideas around like paul baran at rand but they were nowhere near as useful as what donald davies did in terms of size of packets and nodes
1274753 it was donald who had the idea of making a set of nodes that you send packets of data to that find their own way through
1274754 they had a whole series of early computers at npl that they turned in to a local area network lan

1274777 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
1274778 teachers are bending over backwards to respect home prejudices that children have been brought up with the government could do more but it doesnt want to because it is fanatical about multiculturalism and the need to respect the different traditions from which these children come
1274779 in the context of being one of a range of views on evolution
1274780 the government particularly under tony blair thinks it is wonderful to have children brought up with their traditional religions i call it brainwashing

1274786 most devout muslims are creationists so when you go to schools there are a large number of children of islamic parents who trot out what they have been taught
1274787 i have a lot of time for the church of england
1274788 i feel rather sorry for them in a way compared to the alternatives it is a thoroughly decent organisation and if all christians were like rowan there wouldnt be a problem ive met him socially and he is delightful
1274789 when i go to dinner with a bishop i find them very often extremely often very convivial nice people why ever not
1274790 often when you talk to bishops it appears they dont believe in very much
1274791 it would appear he does believe in it the virgin birth
1274792 but he doesnt thrust it down peoples throats his kind of anglicanism is benign and pretty harmless
1274793 i think weve kind of hit the nail on the head
1274794 its easy for baristas to implement and its easy for customers to understand
1274795 certainly a discounting approach could lead to a better perception of value in the short run but the longer term question remains at the regular everyday price point would the consumer still see starbucks as offering the right value for them
1274796 just remember one thing my son no one is bigger than the club the club will be here long after you go us supporters aint mugs well not too many to end if you dont want us and our club aint big enough for you then f ck right off
1274797 were very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries david and nigel theyre like poets like shelley and byron theyre two distinct types of visionaries its like fire and ice basically i feel my role in the band is to be somewhere in the middle of that kind of like lukewarm water
1274798 can you hear me tommy trinder johnny haynes dodi fayed wolfy smith your boys took a hell of a beating
1274799 each season there is a team that goes into freefall and gets sucked into the relegation scrap losing becomes a habit like winning and if we aint careful that team could be us
1274800 clearly my words have gone to the highest level expect him gone in may
1274801 as a spurs supporter of no half measure i will continue to support jol hughton the squad and the entire club to the best of my ability and at all times
1274802 i hear glenn hoddle has found god that must have been one hell of a pass
1274803 white hart lane was always a place where i felt i belonged
1274804 even now when i go over to my mothers house and dig out the old tracksuit tops i wore it makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck i like to think i am part of a special family i am no longer connected with the club on a daily basis but im delighted with every win and sad about every defeat
1274805 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing
1274806 bill did so much for his beloved spurs that we must never let his legacy fade he must be our inspiration as we strive to ensure that a new era dawns here at white hart lane
1274807 oh dear its f cked is what ive always taken it to mean i do have o level latin now theyve stuck up a literal translation in large letters to dare is to do the words just stand there on their own not making much sense
1274808 when gazza came to the spurs training ground for the first time got the ball went round 8 players as if they were not there and then smashed the ball into the net just to see him play like that made the hair stand up on the back of your neck everybody stood there and applauded him
1274809 we will not be pushed around by a bunch of north london yobbos
1274810 the worst thing spurs ever did was get rid of keith burkinshaw they never replaced him
1274811 when youve finished playing football young man which is going to be very soon i feel youll make a very good security guard
1274812 if someone wants to give you a bum steer on who were after then so be it if you want to know ask me because i have a list of players we want and robbie keane isnt on it
1274813 the biggest regret of my whole football career was leaving white hart lane in 1970 my interest in football weakened after that i was heartbroken
1274814 i know more about smalz herring than i do about football
1274815 the trouble with christian gross is that no one had heard of him the communication wasnt brilliant and as captain i decided to explain to him how things worked and what the players liked and were used to i do not believe he listened to a word i said
1274816 always had a bit of time make a little bit of space look up bang and you know he could put it on a postage stamp from 40 yards mmmmmmmmm
1274817 the great fallacy is that the game is first and last about winning its nothing of the kind the game is about glory its about doing things in style with a flourish about going out and beating the other lot not waiting for them to die of boredom
1274818 i was sitting just a few feet away from david pleat at the world cup hes a nice fellow but the man is mad certifiably eye spiningly mad
1274819 muito cedo para dizer que somos candidatos vaga na libertadores nosso in cio foi muito ruim se queremos o t tulo ou o g4 temos de aumentar e muito nosso aproveitamento se conseguirmos duas vit rias nesses dois jogos a sim podemos come ar a pensar em libertadores e mais tarde at no t tulo
1274820 as scotlands young people continue to aim high and achieve so much we can look to a future where scotland is smarter and we can compete on equal terms with the rest of the world even in these difficult economic times
1274821 these results show continuing strong achievements in what is a robust scottish education system
1274822 further measures in the autumn to help people with housing and through them the housing market
1274823 theres no doubt today that what is happening now is far more profound and will be more prolonged than people thought 12 months ago when the problems first arose
1274824 the important thing is that we are straight with people we are going through a tough time thats likely to continue for a while we are no exception every country in the world is going through this
1274825 i am looking at a number of measures and im not going to be drawn on that today because we have not concluded what exactly we need to do
1274826 its helping people thats important i want to look at a range of options that will help people
1274827 there are two problems in relation to windfall taxes one is the principle and one is the practicality two years ago people were calling for a windfall tax on the banks i dont think anyone will be doing that today
1274828 i think the principle of providing certainty and stability especially if you take our energy companies where i want them to be investing in new plant and power stations i think thats very important
1274829 my main focus is on working with them to see how we can help their customers meet the higher bills that they are facing at the moment
1274830 the prime minister is very focused on what we need to do to recapture peoples enthusiasm
1274831 it is very clear to me that provided we can get across to people what we are for and the difference government can make the clear principle of fairness that governs everything we do then we can turn the situation around
1274832 weve argued that it is easier to make a concession on stamp duty when the amount you are making from it is falling
1274833 its clear that consumer confidence is falling and people would benefit from the reassurance that one of those upfront costs of entering the housing market is being removed
1274834 its still important for the government to sort out mortgage funding if you stimulate demand but dont sort out funding you create a whole set of other problems
1274835 just a note to correct reports that tickets are becoming available for planned u2 shows
1274836 there are no tour dates for the band at the moment so please dont buy tickets for u2 shows you see advertised
1274837 you can be sure any future live announcements will be made on u2 com as soon as they are confirmed
1274838 we are looking very closely at hospitals which have already experienced serious outbreaks of this condition and were looking at what theyve done and put in place to reduce their numbers
1274839 we have actually brought over a team from england called the safer cleaner hospitals team to tell us about what approaches are being used and are having good success in great britain
1274840 i just dont get where the entertainment is coming from at all
1274841 it had been my plan to propose to lisa in the house and i had told someone at big brothers production company
1274842 then lo and behold within ten minutes of entering the house i was getting married
1274843 shes been amazing she was the rock she really was the rock the people that took care of me did a great job and got me back on track
1274844 life has been tough enough that honestly throughout my life ive always really valued the good days i had a nice reminder of it by virtue of having a heart attack
1274845 i certainly didnt want to be a statistic who died at 53 if i can have several years ahead of me that i hope are full of life and love and some artistic reward thats what i value

1274847 a lot of people realised that point to point was going to be a big problem even for telephones even before they thought about computers
1274848 the problem was how you turn it away from that
1274849 there were other ideas around like paul baran at rand but they were nowhere near as useful as what donald davies did in terms of size of packets and nodes
1274850 it was donald who had the idea of making a set of nodes that you send packets of data to that find their own way through
1274851 they had a whole series of early computers at npl that they turned in to a local area network lan
1274852 the important breakthrough that he and his team made was to build the lan and make it work

1274860 this is without doubt the most exciting digital photography announcement this year
1274861 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california simply affirms the historic logical and reasonable definition of marriage and does not remove any benefits from other contractual arrangements
1274862 what has never changed is that marriage is the ideal relationship between a man and a woman for the purpose of procreation and the continuation of the human race
1274863 discounts the biological and organic reality of marriage and how deeply embedded it is in our culture our language and our laws and ignores the common understanding of the word marriage
1274864 diminishes the word marriage to mean only a partnership a purely adult contractual arrangement for individuals over the age of 18 children if there are any are no longer a primary societal rationale for the institution
1274865 same sex unions are not the same as opposite sex unions
1274866 sexual complementarity as designed by nature but includes their ability to procreate
1274867 offer themselves to god as co creators of a new human being
1274868 any other pairing while possibly offering security and companionship to the individuals involved is not marriage

1274899 youve got to say well done to him because while
1274900 i would say it is down to his looks and personality which are even more important over there than over here i wouldnt say hes got this completely for his football
1274901 but i would say its also down to who he has been seen with over there the likes of tom cruise as a friend wont harm him hes done extremely well to win this
1274902 when you look everything that victorias done hasnt really worked so it is all down to him and in the future i would imagine it will be more of the same
1274903 when you looked at the situation before he went you have to say that it looked like a bit of a mission impossible so to win this shows the effect hes had
1274904 in the future i would think it will be more of the same he knows how to play the pr game and hes good at it
1274905 mr rudd and mr swan between them over eight months have destroyed business and consumer confidence in the australian economy

1274986 weve had indications from virginia that they would welcome the museum
1274987 but weve not entered into any discussions to do so because we believe valley forge is the preferred location

1274995 they dont want a successful museum next to a park thats deteriorated bureaucracy and the government is often petty
1274996 our concern is the impact of this museum development on the historic character of valley forge
1274997 if we build the museum its going to be good for the park and the park would be good for arc

1275006 the location of our trails is along scenic streams creeks and rivers its beautiful but flooding is to be expected
1275007 during the floods in iowa city the bicycle became one of the main ways to get around town because traffic was backed up so much
1275008 tuesday should be a much more comfortable day and essentially it wont be as humid
1275009 people come in they want to talk about the storm
1275010 they still do they tell you what they were doing ask you what you were doing everyone who comes in here everyone has a story theres hundreds of people in the same boat were in
1275011 the most icky green thing youll ever want to see
1275012 our house didnt fly away it just completely blew up
1275013 that minute and a half how it changed this town
1275014 people sit down in the coffee shops in the morning and say what did you get done yesterday we got our basement set down we got floor plans things like that
1275015 lord for my sake teach me to take one day at a time
1275016 la d t rioration de la conjoncture se poursuit en juillet dans le secteur fran ais des services lactivit enregistrant un taux de contraction record et les perspectives des entreprises chutant de nouveau un plus bas historique

1275022 prohibitions on receiving contributions from foreigners and guidelines against accepting more than 2 300 from one individual during a single election
1275023 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1275024 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1275025 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1275026 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1275027 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1275028 aber wenn ich noch f r mclaren fahren w rde w re ich vielleicht in der gleichen situation und h tte keine chance auf siege
1275029 sprechen wir nicht dar ber was fernando gesagt oder nicht gesagt hat
1275030 als wir den vertrag mit fernando aufgel st haben gab es klare bedingungen welche das verhalten beider parteien danach festlegten wir haben nicht vor diese vereinbarung zu brechen
1275031 seine meinung ist seine meinung ich werde keine meinung dazu abgeben was fernando getan oder gesagt hat
1275032 es gibt keine marionettenschn re an heikkis schultern und er ist ein ehrlicher kerl
1275033 aber tats chlich war lewis sieben zehntel schneller als heikki
1275034 wir haben es ihm gesagt aber nicht dass er ihn vorbeilassen m sse
1275035 er ist fit und wenn ein rennfahrer einen lauf hat m chte er sich ins auto setzen und rennen fahren das ist ganz normal
1275036 ich habe sicherlich ein bisschen zeit um mich von diesem wochenende und der ersten saisonh lfte zu erholen
1275037 aber es ist auch eine gute zeit um den pr verpflichtungen nachzugehen
1275038 ich freue mich unheimlich auf die beiden rennen nat rlich werde ich mein bestes geben aber viel wichtiger als das ergebnis ist der gute zweck
1275039 ich konnte punkte in der gesamtwertung aufholen und mit den rennergebnissen zufrieden
1275040 unser ziel ist es ferrari in der konstrukteurs wm einzuholen
1275041 aber auch lewis pace hinter felipe war im ersten stint sehr respektabel
1275042 er konnte den abstand bis zum ersten stopp bei rund drei sekunden halten deswegen waren wir nicht besonders besorgt wegen der pace von ferrari
1275043 wir waren zuversichtlich dass wir in einer viel st rkeren position in den letzten stint gegangen w ren
1275044 wir verraten nat rlich nicht was das f r teile sind aber ich bin mir sicher dass wir am freitag in valencia einige neue komponenten sehen werden
1275045 es ist ein gro es teil das sehr windanf llig ist wir hatten das gef hl dass uns die experimente damit nicht gen gend performancevorteil bringen w rden
1275046 this is a little different from anything ive ever seen
1275047 i made a mistake and i know what i did was wrong
1275048 the governor is certainly glad to see that the attorney general responded with candor
1275049 i am asking the supreme court to think about the innocent children in our society instead of sex offenders rights
1275050 although socially inept and no doubt annoying his conduct did not approach sexual harassment
1275051 persons who are socially tone deaf are not by that characteristic necessarily the equivalent of sexual harassers
1275052 hes a perfectionist with this which when youre building an airplane is a very good thing
1275053 its like you were driving an old pickup just going along and if you dont know any better thats great
1275054 if you get into a porsche you really feel the difference
1275055 camp who enjoy the hell out of the building process
1275056 in this thing well go upside down and do loops
1275057 im hacking the weeds im blazing a trail with a machete
1275058 i wanted to see what we could do that was doable financially and would make a difference especially for pedestrians
1275059 we all know how dangerous roosevelt boulevard is these timers really give pedestrians the information they need to cross such a wide road
1275060 they have no idea how long that green light has been on
1275061 the fact is that the abuses occurred on bills watch and as such he will always be a symbol of a broken system
1275062 as the democratic leader he should take responsibility and resign his leadership post
1275063 we must not allow anything or anyone to distract us from moving forward with this reform agenda
1275064 as you look at key moments in this particular event i think this might be seen as one of those that starts to tip the scales against deweese within the party
1275065 i like him as a human being and i consider him a friend
1275066 i am not sure if he considers me a friend anymore
1275067 we need leaders who are committed to transformational reform we need a monumental shift and we need it now
1275068 we cant do better at least in our caucus until we dedicate ourselves to a new direction
1275069 we need leaders who possess the publics trust bill deweese does not
1275070 once the public trust is shattered it can never be put back together
1275071 bill deweeses presence as the leader of our caucus the face of our caucus dramatically undermines that effort to expand our majority and may even compromise it
1275072 we are weeding through the applications i believe we are down to under 100 but you would be surprised how many people will put down an answer to a question that is just utterly ridiculous when the pile becomes less thats when it is more difficult
1275073 plans were put in place yesterday sunday to make this cat safer it has been moved to a safe house we didnt want to take any chances
1275074 there is more than just this cat its been a spokescat for all animals who dont have homes and there are so many cats and dogs
1275075 after dinner it was such a beautiful night they went for a ride up the river
1275076 on the way back bob was showing jody how he looks for channel markers and other boats they never saw the other boat they never heard it it just came out of the blue
1275077 it was with the cell phones that they were able to get the position of the boat they had lost all their running lights when they were hit
1275078 to produce a picture of the circumstances surrounding the crash
1275079 we are weeding through the applications i believe we are down to under 100
1275080 i could just see that the figure of the child it was lifeless
1275081 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists
1275082 comes from her first name despite days of flipping over rocks during their 2006 trip to densely populated barbados on nearby st lucia they also found a second new species dubbed
1275083 blairs been very good at getting off the beaten track
1275084 you might look at two election cycles to say has this pac that im about to contribute to as a potential professional vendor has it in the past supported or opposed evesham candidates
1275085 its an excellent ban it really is and more townships should follow our lead on it
1275086 the scope of the evesham pay to play ordinance does not include my candidacy for higher office but make no mistake about it when we win our election we will be introducing legislation much like the evesham pay to play ordinance
1275087 based on the facts given it appears to be a violation of the spirit of the local pay to play ordinance
1275088 theres really a lot of frustration about the lack of information or lack of coordination where theyre really concerned that their clients might violate both the law and the spirit of the law
1275089 just simply because they dont know what every municipality has required
1275090 while the losses reported today are likely to continue as the restructuring proceeds and as the credit environment remains difficult i am confident that the foundations have been well laid for recovery and return in due course to private ownership
1275091 trading in july has given an encouraging start to the second half year and the outlook for the rest of the year continues to be in line with our expectations
1275092 for the second half continued growth in the global production of steel foundry castings and solar panels should support a further strong improvement in the performance of the ceramics division benefiting from a full period contribution from foseco and from our continuing investment in capacity in higher growth higher margin areas
1275093 the electronics division is expected to continue to maintain performance around 2007 levels the precious metals division is expected to remain profitable despite the weak retail jewellery markets
1275094 it continues to provide excellent revenue visibility for the financial year that has just started and for subsequent periods
1275095 meggitt has delivered another excellent set of results in the first half of 2008 and the strong order intake gives confidence that the group will continue to perform in the second half
1275096 however historically growth in air travel has been resilient in the face of oil price spikes and economic downturns and the capacity reductions announced so far will not have a material effect on the group
1275097 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1275098 one of the reasons im going is because i want to show respect to the chinese people and this is a proud moment for china
1275099 my main objective in my discussions on religious freedom is to remind this new generation of leadership that religion is not to be feared but to be welcomed in society
1275100 oh i think he listens absolutely i think hes interested he absorbs he takes in he listens
1275101 cadel will be flying in tomorrow and the news is that hell definitely be riding in the road race
1275102 and depending on how he goes after that he may ride in the time trial but that wont be decided until after the road race
1275103 we were devastated after athens and resolved to make whatever changes were necessary to address any shortcomings
1275104 our plan has been driven very much by the athens experience and not wishing to repeat it
1275105 by the end of august we will know how successful we have been in our approach
1275106 athletes from overseas spent a lot of time in australia in the build up to 2000 this meant we didnt have to travel to the extent that we would normally leading to savings that could be spent in other areas
1275107 preparations for the 2004 olympics in europe were expensive and were made more so because of inflation and the relative strength of the dollar against european currencies at the time
1275108 in an expensive equipment based sport this had a significant impact on all areas of our program and the ability of our athletes to properly prepare all this coupled with the benefits of the familiarity of a home games in 2000 certainly had an impact in 2004
1275109 it is the best job in the ioc because you have the honor to represent the voice of the athlete i think frankie will take the athletes commission to the next level hes a perfect fit for the role
1275110 les r sultats du premier trimestre sont en ligne avec son objectif dun r sultat dexploitation de lordre dun milliard deuros

1275112 the mention in the last statement that downside growth risks appeared to have diminished somewhat now looks like a premature conclusion
1275113 the extension and enhancement of the liquidity facilities suggests the fed remains concerned about financial stability and thus is unlikely to raise rates in the near term
1275114 with oil and commodity prices not growing nearly as rapidly as earlier this year headline inflation rates are set to moderate by the end of the year
1275115 is likely to continue with hawkish rhetoric reiterating their vigilance against inflation but also noting that their expectation that slack in the economy should help mitigate inflationary pressures over several quarters
1275116 were pretty well positioned for the downside risks we might encounter from here
1275117 i worry a little bit more about the prospects for inflation
1275118 this meeting statement will likely do more to cement the notion of a fed on hold for the long haul as inflation risks stabilize but growth risks fail to abate further
1275119 the trading environment in the uk has become more difficult and we can see this continuing for the rest of our financial year
1275120 we all know rod did this two months before his primary election victory over edwin eisendrath
1275121 january 2006 when the fire happens and hes in the march primary against eisendrath rod was pandering for black votes i understand that but you cant have the state donating 1 million to a church you cant do that with tax dollars
1275122 faith becomes detached from the heart and the gospel is prostituted
1275123 baptists became known as champions for religious freedom they demanded often to their own peril the right to practice religion without interference from the state baptists also stood with other faiths and even with those who professed no faith for the right to the same principle as they did the numbers of baptists grew partly because people admired baptists for practicing the golden rule and partly because baptists maintained their responsibility to share the gospel the credibility baptists built up enhanced their efforts of evangelism
1275124 baptists embraced this concept during their days as a minority and today we as baptists and other christians ought not to forget this concept now that we have numbers and money in our corner the surest way to lose disciples is to try to force christianity on the masses that has been tried it does not work lets get back to living by the golden rule and applying it to church and state issues
1275125 suddenly a tidal wave comes out of nowhere and harry dies the end
1275126 the example of jesus christ and the teachings of the bible
1275127 by giving scholarship money to students who attend sectarian but not pervasively sectarian universities colorado necessarily and explicitly discriminates among religious institutions extending scholarship to students at some religious institutions but not to those deemed too thoroughly sectarian by government officials
1275128 this is discrimination on the basis of religious views or religious status
1275129 the bible as the infallible word of god the existence of god in the father son and holy spirit the divinity of jesus christ and principles of salvation present ministry resurrection and the spiritual unity of believers in our lord jesus christ
1275130 like bruce lee taught us the art of fighting without fighting chris carpenter shows us the art of website revenue generation without a website

1275138 cacing mempunyai hempedal seperti ayam oleh kerana cacing tidak ada gigi dan tidak mempunyai sistem penghadaman yang lengkap secara biologi ia akan memakan sekali sedikit pasir letika mengambil makanan untuk mengisar makanan yang dihadamnya pasir tersebut tidak akan menghadamnya tetapi akan keluar sekali bersama sama dengan kasting ini menghasilkan tanah yang mengandungi bahan organik terurai yang tinggi
1275139 lipan bergerak pantas dan sentiasa mencari makanan cacing tanah merupakan salah satu makanan kegemarannya lipan merupakan haiwan kumpulan anthropods yang tinggal di dalam tanah dan humus ia juga boleh ditemui di bawah batu pelepah dan juga kayu tumbang kesemua spesies lipan adalah pemangsa dan ia menggunakan pencengkam berbisanya untuk menangkap menyengat atau membunuh mangsanya
1275140 harga medium sebanyak rm 1 80 adalah harga purata anggaran pasaran masa kini sekiranya medium dibuat sendiri dengan menggunakan campuran najis lembu dan sabut kelapa kosnya akan menjadi lebih rendah harga sabut kelapa halus dari kilang adalah kira kira rm 4 00 seguni yang mengandungi 6kg setiap guni manakala harga tinja lembu upah memungut dan memasukkan dalam guni juga rm 4 00 bagi guni seberat 40 kg ini memberikan kos setiap kg mediums ebanyak rm 0 32
1275141 oleh kerana cacing adalah haiwan herbivor maka makanannya mestilah berasaskan sayur sayuran atau tumbuhan sebab itu walaupun ia memakan najis haiwan tetapi hanya najis haiwan herbivor sahaja yang diterima oleh cacing tanah najis haiwan pemakan daging seperti kucing tidak diterima langsung cacing tanah juga tidak suka makanan dari bahan organik yang mengandungi minyak lemak daging susu pedas masam dan masin
1275142 ive never had a shoulder issue so i didnt know what it felt like
1275143 but i had also to survive because i was getting snow blind
1275144 we were astonished we had to move it that took of course many many hours some turned back because they didnt trust it any more
1275145 the plan was okay but finally some climbers did not take their responsibility and then accidents like this happen very easy
1275146 it takes time things dont happen overnight as ive mentioned over and over
1275147 i was one of those people who felt i would be back here
1275148 pickup is a huge part of my game im excited to get back to it
1275149 ive taken great joy to touch people to make a difference in the game of basketball
1275150 a school district has the right to choose their own bible curriculum because they know their students best
1275151 we have looked through thousands of pages of course materials from texas bible classes
1275152 we know for a fact what is already happening in most of them we know for a fact that most courses promote christian beliefs over those of other religions some classes promote creation science some classes denigrate judaism some classes explicitly encourage students to convert to christianity or to adopt christian devotional practices this is all well documented and the board knows it
1275153 it seems weve reached a conclusive consensus on global alarming
1275154 people are just generally freaked out about everything with each days rising of the sun more and more people are finding incredibly mundane shit to worry about just a couple of hours ago i was speaking to a mother of four children one of which was horribly sick with the flu and all the mother could talk about was how migrating caribou herds might have to walk around oil drilling sites in alaska it was kind of amazing in a pathetic sort of way i even asked her to locate alaska on a map and she pointed to greenland fucking incredible
1275155 you simply wont believe the kind of shit people are worried about nowadays
1275156 a major component to global alarming seems to be the fact that the reporters and talking heads of most of the worlds largest media organizations are more interested in themselves than the stories theyre reporting on
1275157 so you have all these self absorbed people who typically look good on camera and those who can write decent articles but who cant think critically for shit and these are the people shaping public discourse its pretty fucked up when you think about it
1275158 i personally think they should throw it to keyshawn on every play and not throw it to steve smith thats what im hoping
1275159 im going to struggle with any change of schedule im not good in night games monday night games thursday games saturday games they disrupt the rhythm of the schedule so obviously when we get the schedule well have to make some concessions and do what we deem is right to get our team ready to play
1275160 i have two hands and i need two super bowl rings
1275161 for the first time in a long time the tampa bay buccaneers have players on the offensive side of the ball that can grow together
1275162 its great just going into offseason workouts knowing that i am the starter and the organization is looking to me
1275163 of course im extremely excited about that opportunity i havent been in this position in a few years since college really and i think again it just goes back to the direction our team is trying to go right now weve got a good nucleus and were just trying to build from there
1275164 im trying not to get too excited thinking about that i really like bruce
1275165 he knows how to run a huddle competition doesnt bother him i believe hes going to come in here and make this thing very interesting
1275166 im not going to come into the season and surprise people im going to have to work that much harder in the offseason and ill definitely welcome the challenge and im looking forward to it
1275167 we need michael clayton to come back and step up
1275168 he did not play for us this year like the guy that was a threat as a rookie he didnt seem to have the same focus weve talked privately a lot about that he did not have the same kind of year for a lot of reasons i think the injuries the surgeries all those things caught up with him
1275169 this is the kind of lineman ive been looking for for years and years im just really proud of him
1275170 oh i didnt watch them a little bit i watched them all the time
1275171 as a guy in high school i always loved the buccaneers defense
1275172 interceptions have a far greater chance than fumbles of being returned for touchdowns
1275173 the strongest teams arent the ones with clutch kickers but the ones who dont need them
1275174 new englands bill belichick has been selecting pearls in the draft even though the patriots finish at or near the top every season because hes smart enough to know his teams needs good teams are realistic and win because they make smart picks bad teams stay bad because they dont recognize what they need and who can fill that need
1275175 in the history of the nfl dome teams are 15 45 on the road in postseason play and the best dome teams dont even do all that well at home in the playoffs like the colts who were heavily favored at home against the steelers in the afc divisional playoff last year and got stuffed
1275176 necesitamos m s energ a nuclear necesitamos tecnolog a de carb n limpia debemos excavar costa afuera para explotar petr leo y gas natural debemos excavar ahora
1275177 cualquiera que diga que podemos lograr la independencia energ tica sin usar ni aumentar estos recursos energ ticos existentes no tiene la experiencia necesaria para superar los desaf os que enfrentamos o no est hablando de forma directa al pueblo estadounidense
1275178 tenemos que comprometernos seriamente a nivel nacional a desarrollar nuevas fuentes de energ a y debemos hacerlo ahora
1275179 se enterar an de lo que hac a el cu ado en horas de trabajo
1275180 hab a visto qu tipo de persona era claudi b
1275181 en el momento en que se accedi al correo electr nico del perjudicado
1275182 moved forward under the assumption the event was no longer on
1275183 we wish it hadnt happened were certainly sorry it did happen and were going to work with them to find a solution to make things right
1275184 just the fact that your name is linked with the hall of fame is exceptional
1275185 ive tried to make major contributions to the game to touch so many young people to serve on the advisory committee for the mcdonalds high school all american game to create the baker league in 1960 for pros to play in the summer to work as a broadcaster both locally and nationally but this is a dream nobody could have predicted this
1275186 we asked broadridge financial vote tabulating company to double check the votes it transmitted to yahoo on our behalf
1275187 the independent inspector of elections has certified the results and yahoo accurately announced those results
1275188 i was excited relieved i could start getting back on the court
1275189 this is a process where you cant really be on the court without a contract youve just got to wait it out i was excited to be able to stay here and at the same time get back to work
1275190 he was so anxious he didnt have what you could call a big outburst
1275191 it was more like an exhale it was a great process for him
1275192 we talk about upside with players and lous is as high as he wants to go
1275193 what i think is great is hes a hard worker hell give it all he has but this kid has a big upside will he get there thats what were banking on as were giving him this contract and i dont have a big hang up that he has to be a stone cold 1 or 2 i just think hes a good basketball player
1275194 i dont think i or any player sets out to be a sixth man or a seventh man
1275195 you always want to be a big part of a team the position im in now coming off the bench giving us a spark i love that role but you always want to grow as a player
1275196 ive always been one of those type of guys where i always felt i was going to be an nba player and i always felt like i was going to put myself in a position to make a lot of money over my career
1275197 things dont just happen overnight were just in the middle of negotiations

1275202 how in the world can you achieve what you want when the headmaster has been disrespected
1275203 est claro que el ataque fue planeado cuidadosamente y muestra que china tambi n padece una amenaza terrorista
1275204 a menudo si alguien pone una bomba en el aeropuerto de los ngeles est cometiendo un ataque terrorista pero si pone una bomba en urumqi est combatiendo por la libertad
1275205 no creo que el ataque sea un atentato terrorista es una lucha armada y esto ocurre en respuesta a la persistente represi n del gobierno chino en la regi n no existe ninguna base para acusar al etim del atentado al contrario el culpable es el gobierno chino y sus medidas autocr ticas en xinjiang
1275206 in the smb segment we have only 13 per cent market share if i could only take ibm share from 13 30 per cent alone would be 8 million dollar
1275207 the reorganisation will bring us closer to our customers and set the agenda for providing innovative solutions in next generation data centres for the mid market
1275208 people ask all the time if sex scenes and nudity are hard whats hard not the lines or the physicality but the emotion
1275209 by reporting the lives of the rich and the famous who work hard and party hard page 3 serves as an aspiration model for those who want to be like the page 3 celebrities in life
1275210 we mostly deal with subjects that youngsters would like to read about in our city supplements home to the celebrity pages
1275211 serious issues fun and games page 3 is not just wishful thinking if its there it is because a large part of the society wants to read it
1275212 and as a peoples representative i dont want to be a hypocrite these pages are serving a purpose they are dedicated to the high society who want to know all that is happening in their social circuits
1275213 so whats wrong with page 3 it fits into the way newspapers package their contents
1275214 it is socialist thinking page 3 touches the aspirational nerve of society
1275215 it must have a little bit of spice that can spice up everyones life after all newspapers are family products
1275216 i definitely would not want a dj speaking about bomb blasts this is what page 3 tends to do sometimes we should talk to people relevant to it

1275289 the acquisition of ranbaxy should not be viewed merely as another corporate m amp a ranbaxy is one of the leading suppliers of many life saving generic drugs including arv drugs for the treatment of hiv aids this acquisition particularly given the history of daiichi sankyo in filing lawsuits against generic competition has the potential to adversely impact access to affordable medicines in india and other developing countries
1275290 in the coming days ranbaxy may not be in a position to follow any aggressive strategy to introduce generic drugs including the use of pre and post grant oppositions and compulsory licences which allows generic companies to override patents and copy cat versions in emergency situations

1275306 india is playing a more strategic role in early discovery it is regarded as a more mature venue for chemistry and drug discovery activities than china
1275307 companies such as ranbaxy aurigene advinus nicholas piramal and jubilant have negotiated long term deals with western pharmaceutical companies to discover and develop new chemical entities in a growing number of cases the indian companies share the financial risk in discovery as well as the potential financial rewards
1275308 one chinese company hutchison medipharma has formed a similar partnership with eli lilly others are likely to follow suit as chinese contract research organisations gain experience and western companies come to trust in chinas ability to protect intellectual property
1275309 having more countries like india and china develop treatments for diseases is good for the world and will help reduce the overall costs of health care but the us benefits most when those discoveries are made by companies owned primarily by us citizens

1275383 the primary importance of marriages between the indians and the french was not genetic but cultural
1275384 a new nation in their hearts the historical evolution of the metis people
1275385 while most of the canadien and acadien people were meeting their indian nieghbors on mutual ground they had no more control of the colony than did the tribes france had created a three headed monster to oversee its exploitation of new france the colonial administration the merchants and the church within their own cultural contexts they the church fathers must have thought they were fulfilling some sort of mission here but they usually only produced dissent and division among the tribes for the canadiens and neighboring natives there was an escape from the church and the colonial officials by joining the fur trade and moving to the west or north of the core of the colony along the st lawrence river those people who permanently left the french colony became the first generation of the new nation the metisage of their canadien roots smoothed the way for their economic social and genealogical acceptance among the native nations of the west
1275386 the process of metisage that had begun in canada became more dominant in the pays den haut like illinois michigan etc where small french settlements were intermingled among native villages
1275387 when the fall of new france had begun the english armies first gobbled up acadie and in 1760 forced the capitulation of canada to deal with the acadien problem in newly conquered acadie the british rounded up the french speaking inhabitants locked them up in stockades until they could be deported or sold in slavery in the american colonies or the west indies some of these deportees escaped to louisiana being the ancestors of the modern cajuns while others fled into the woods surviving for decades under the protection of their relatives in the tribal nations
1275388 there are memories of wild places that have come to dwell in the most intimate regions of my mind
1275389 i am following events with increasing urgency every day the news eats into me in tracing the legacy i inherited my mind settles on 1776 the year that the american colonies officially declared for their independence from great britain because it is the inner life i have chosen to explore instead of armies and battles it is in fact the declaration of independence that draws me i cannot say when i first heard the words that thomas jefferson wrote nor do i know when exactly i came to understand what they meant i only know that certain passages are do deeply embedded in my memory that in the way that time becomes flexible in the mind they have fused inextricably with who i am
1275390 that glow of the candlelight itself represents something real in the interior life of democracy a promise not just the hope for the private improvements in the conditions of each life that come from freedom and equality but something more general and less visible the possibility perhaps of achieving the state of mind that can come from living in a world shaped by reciprocity and from this mutuality the sense of being kindred with others
1275391 i am thinking of the communion i felt as a child in the sierra under trees or in fields of wildflowers
1275392 a word portrait of the melungeon or mountain native granny may be gleaned from legends and documents
1275393 for the first century of so after contact native americans did not differentiate between pale skinned and darker skinned newcomers in effect they had to learn about eurocentric racism over the next century through firsthand experiences beginning in the mid senenteenth century english speaking travelers in the southern appalachian region encountered communities of ethnically mixed peoples who defied easy categorization when later waves of of european migrant families flowed into the area and eventually came to dominate the cultural landscape their very survival in outlying places at first depended upon the hospitality of thse more native than not women and their mixed ancestry offspring who retained local on the ground power via kinship and clan oriented networks throughout the colonial period social and genetic intermingling was not uncommon indeed various imperial authorities sought to encourage european indian intermarriage
1275394 new race categories the amalgamation categories white black or negro and mulatto served to privilege whites to disenfranchise and enslave blacks and the offspring of slave women of mixed ancestry and to marginalize and otherwise control mulattoes and free persons of color
1275395 a colony of dark skinned reddish brown complexioned people supposedly of moorish descent who called themselves malungeons sic and claimed to be portugese they live to themselves exclusively in the high ridges and are looked upon neither as negroes or indians they have fine european features straight black hair and dark blue eyes
1275396 for this community to self identify as melungeon and claim a portugese affiliation during the eighteenth century one could argue might simply translate as dont kill me im not spanish or english or french or the groups assertion of their melungeon identity during the colonial period may also be interpreted as their refusal to cooperate with emergent racial national classification schemes melungeon identity perhaps proved useful at time in allowing individuals to claim selective genealogical connections to safe ethnicities that is to whomever was not at war with their neighbors or other protagonists

1275423 thats pretty much all they talk about in the bus when were on the road i like to call them little intellectuals and when im recording with people even though i write the music its always better when the musicians are interested not just coming in to play to make a buck so i try to write music and i think i picked this up from chick specifically for those individuals
1275424 one of the things i like about the fact that cds dont sell so much anymore
1275425 is that the whole idea of making music to be played on the radio seems so ridiculous i used to do that a lot but now i think it gives musicians the freedom to forget about radio to go out and just play something and record something one of my friends said stanley youre sick to think like this but whatever
1275426 i met marcus when he was 14 and victor when he was a little younger and im really proud of both of those guys theyre truly bass virtuosos

1275440 il non aver differenziato i centri di entrata rispetto a quelli di spesa con laggravante dei trasferimenti statali legati alla spesa storica e non ai costi standard ha determinato non solo unesplosione della spesa pubblica ma anche il venir meno della trasparenza della resposanbilizzazione di chi amministra e del controllo democratico da parte dei cittadini sui propri amministratori nonch un aumento dellevasione fiscale con il modello di federalismo fiscale che io ho proposto e la conseguente autonomia impositiva dei comuni degli enti locali e delle regioni tutto questo non potr pi accadere non solo perch il popolo potr controllare il sindaco e gli altri amministratori su come vengono utilizzati i suoi soldi e per il livello di prestazioni che viene offerto ma anche perch sar proprio il sindaco che pu ben controllare i cittadini di cui conosce benissimo i livelli di vita il primo ad essere interessato a fargli pagare il giusto delle tasse e una volta emerso il nero locale da questa emersione ne trarranno beneficio anche a livello regionale e nazionale per cui questo mio modello di fedralismo fiscale far s che a pagare le tasse saranno veramente tutti e che quindi tutti ne pagheranno di meno
1275441 e veramente spiacevole che osservatori solitamente cos attenti come gli editorialisti di famiglia cristiana non abbiano individuato le numerose misure di semplificazione gi presenti nel decreto legge collegato alla finanziaria e quelle ulteriori introdotte nella conversione del sopra citato decreto
1275442 por lo que sabemos la clase obrera de bigote blanco aprobaba las ejecuciones por lo que sabemos desde los entusiastas komsomoles hasta los l deres del partido y los legendarios jefes militares toda la vanguardia aprobaba un nimemente dichas ejecuciones los revolucionarios c lebres los te ricos y los profetas a siete a os de su poco gloriosa ca da aplaud an este rugido de la multitud sin sospechar que su d a estaba al llegar que faltaba poco para que sus nombres fueran absorbidos al grito de hez y basura
1275443 the surprise is that the audiences that turn up are for the most part young
1275444 theyre sprinkled with fans who obviously knew the band back in the day but its mostly young people who are very excitable and receiving the music very enthusiastically thats been a big surprise for me i didnt know what to expect
1275445 you go into a room where the average age is 45 to 65 and you see guys jumping up like theyre 19 or 20 we put the music together and we didnt realize until we got on the stage that all our fans had aged with us
1275446 playing all kinds of music but mostly on the edge very improvised kind of wild music but toward the end i was really wanting to experience getting grooving rhythms and lyrical melodies across to an audience i became more interested in how to reach an audience with music so that was the basic intent of return to forever to take everything i knew with music and put it in a form that could reach out to a lot of people
1275447 its hard to say specifically what comes out of what
1275448 but one thing that came about through studying the works of hubbard was a rediscovery of the importance of communication in life in general so i started to apply that kind of realization that i had to music
1275449 its like anything where two guys just start out doing something together
1275450 its like two guys who open up a restaurant or open up a shoe store when we started out chick had maybe 10 cents in his pocket and i probably had 15 we just went for it and that was it
1275451 a lot of life went down during those years and a lot of changes
1275452 a lot of growing i think too it came to a point where each guy was thinking more toward doing his own music i actually encouraged that to happen because it was a natural thing
1275453 weve been talking about it for years whenever we cross paths or join each other on a project the subject of the band always comes up but everyone has developed a pretty active if not intense career so its just that the discussions about putting it together got a little bit more intense over the past couple of years and we decided to just get down to brass tacks and carve out a schedule
1275454 everyone is much wiser not to say that the adolescent quality that we all love in music from young people is bad but were older and we still have a lot of passion i actually think the band is much more soulful now than it ever was
1275455 chick said a really cool thing to me the other night he said i have to finally admit it return to forever is the most successful powerful thing ive done in my entire career and i actually agree with him in my own life its probably the most significant musical adventure that ive had
1275456 our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter
1275457 but what i do know is that this is not what i wanted my high school experience to be
1275458 people tend to talk about sex all the time in high school kids talk about sex they talk about emotions they have a lot of held in things just like my character does in the show

1275463 we have to return to unity division is exactly what occupation wants
1275464 we must support the use of democracy and promote dialogue within the palestinian society
1275465 the current internal division is a direct consequence of israel jeopardizing palestinian democracy by refusing to work with the unity government and denying the legitimate outcome of the democratic practices
1275466 israel is trying to provoke peaceful palestinian demonstrators into using violence

1275503 estamos enfrentando grandes dificultades para atenderlos no estamos preparados para eso desde el 2001 no hab amos recibido ning n ping ino por aqu y desde el 17 de julio pasado ya hemos recibido cerca de 500
1275504 primero los ubicamos en el centro de rehabilitaci n que est bamos construyendo y despu s tuvimos que improvisar alojamientos en las piscinas en las cl nicas y hasta en nuestro auditorio todas nuestras reas est n comprometidas

1275509 incluso en salvador la temperatura del agua est actualmente tres grados cent grados m s fr a que lo normal
1275510 pero esos ping inos soportan temperaturas que var an entre los 7 y los 30 grados cent grados no son de zonas totalmente heladas y por eso no llegan a sentirse totalmente inc modos en salvador en donde la temperatura promedio es de 28 grados cent grados
1275511 revertir el estado en que llegan es muy complicado y tenemos que tratarlos con medicinas y alimentarlos con pur de sardina pero estamos logrando un proceso satisfactorio de recuperaci n y ya conseguimos que algunos se alimenten solos

1275541 although va has made progress on its 11 billion healthevet initiative it has also experienced significant delays and none of the associated development projects have been completed moreover va is proceeding with this complex initiative without a project management plan and validated cost estimates to coordinate and guide the effort at the same time a governance structure for healthevet has not yet been established and key leadership positions that are responsible for providing day to day oversight have not been permanently staffed further several it governance boards with oversight responsibility for healthevet have not yet performed essential reviews of healthevet projects to gauge progress and funding requirements and the department lacks a time frame for doing so until the department takes the necessary actions to fully address these matters it will face the risk that healthevet may experience cost overruns and continued schedule slippages and may not achieve the outcome it intends to achieve

1275602 integrated visibility and control over the movement of inventory and assets across todays complex global supply networks can be slow costly and very challenging in the past inventory and the assets used to ship them were tracked in two separate systems which made closed loop tracking of assets very difficult with the new release customers can manage this combined movement through a single process driving greater efficiency improved visibility and stronger control over supply chain operations
1275603 being able to manage inventory and assets in a single system provides inherent efficiencies there are significant costs tied up in reusable assets used in distribution operations it makes sense to track these along with the inventory they transport for a complete view of the supply chain in motion

1275796 good to see a young writer taking that option rather than the usual realism and social commentary dovey does it with fine prose and a tantalising narrative
1275797 only two black south african women published books written in english in the 1960s noni jabavu and bessie head and both did so from outside the country
1275798 women are the heroines of continuance who sustain life making sure life continues from one era to the next they have known the agony and the ecstasy they have known treachery rejection and betrayal they will no doubt redeem society through the release of their creative potential
1275799 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1275800 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1275801 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1275802 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1275803 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1275804 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1275805 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1275806 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1275807 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1275808 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1275809 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1275810 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1275811 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1275812 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1275813 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1275814 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1275815 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1275816 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1275817 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1275818 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1275819 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1275820 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1275821 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1275822 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1275823 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute

1276072 please stop calling patients consumers patients are people with illnesses or injuries who need medical care consumers are people who purchase goods or services and are informed about what theyre purchasing most patients are not actively dictating what health care resources theyre consuming note there are certainly consumers of health information but a person who comes to me seeking medical attention is not a consumer he or she is a patient
1276073 the patient controls who sees the information in their medical record but the patients physician controls the actual information

1276078 im looking at a number of measures its helping people thats important i want to look at a range of options that would help people
1276079 there are two problems in relation to windfall taxes one in principle and one in practicality
1276080 the principle of providing certainty and stability certainly if you take our energy companies when i want them to be investing in new power stations is very important
1276081 and in relation to practicality if you look at the oil companies a lot of them make a lot of their money outside the uk and pay taxes in those countries where they carry out those operations
1276082 my main focus at the moment is working with energy companies to see how we can help people meet the difficult higher bills theyre facing
1276083 northern rock along with every other bank across the world is facing a very difficult time
1276084 the difficult situation is going to continue for a while yet northern rock needs more share capital it doesnt have shareholders of its own so its got to come to us what weve said is that we will put in up to 3bn
1276085 if you look over the last year at the 27bn loan made by the bank of england northern rock has repaid just over 9bn of that and we expect those repayments to continue
1276086 the news of that abject surrender provoked an explosion of outrage across jammu
1276087 the governor has violated the sasb act he cannot act unilaterally any decision of the board has to be endorsed by at least five members
1276088 he is also in contempt of the high court which had passed an interim order approving the transfer of 800 kanals of land to the board in baltal
1276089 i dont recall such a massive bandh in recent years
1276090 each death only makes us more determined we are not going to be bullied by the valley anymore jammu wants a voice of its own jammus hindus will no longer tolerate oppression by kashmirs muslims
1276091 vohra did neither he only added fuel to the fire he has been insensitive and his actions have only served to provoke the protesters
1276092 y ears of neglect of jammu by kashmir has resulted in what you are seeing today the people are frustrated the pandits have at last found a platform to vent their anger jammu has more people than kashmir but the lions share always goes to the valley
1276093 clearly underestimated the determination of jammus long suffering hindus who have had to cope with denial and deprivation for decades as the state government focuses only on the kashmir valley
1276094 it was his way of registering his protest against omar abdullahs speech in parliament he was incensed by the national conference leaders duplicity

1276098 i was like an old man i could barely walk because i was using so much now im completely clean
1276099 the death of danieal kelly is one of the most tragic incidents that i have encountered in over 20 years of public service in philadelphia
1276100 i read the grand jurys report not just as the mayor of the city of philadelphia but also as the father of a daughter only one year younger than danieal was when she died i was outraged appalled and heartbroken
1276101 let me say once again danieals death will not be in vain
1276102 if you really want them to see you as sincere pull your mouth as far to one of your ears as possible viewers eat that crap up with a spoon
1276103 yea for the miracles i have shown you thus far are of no consequence in comparison to the wonder of baked circular pastries in a variety of flavours
1276104 weve come to rely on gores uncompromising seriousness and intensity this single moment of weakness on als part could completely change the make up of the democratic party what with all the ex hippies and young slackers that make up this party we need gore to show america that not all democrats have a sense of humor
1276105 i think this is the first time since albert iii was conceived that theyve physically expressed their love for one another
1276106 it is precisely that kind of commitment to celibacy that has given gore the icy determination to accomplish all he has
1276107 and with one sweaty act gore may have released the very thing that held his career together
1276108 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1276109 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1276110 the fact is that the abuses occurred on bills watch and as such he will always be a symbol of a broken system
1276111 as the democratic leader he should take responsibility and resign his leadership post
1276112 we must not allow anything or anyone to distract us from moving forward with this reform agenda
1276113 as you look at key moments in this particular event i think this might be seen as one of those that starts to tip the scales against deweese within the party
1276114 i like him as a human being and i consider him a friend
1276115 i am not sure if he considers me a friend anymore
1276116 we need leaders who are committed to transformational reform we need a monumental shift and we need it now
1276117 we cant do better at least in our caucus until we dedicate ourselves to a new direction
1276118 we need leaders who possess the publics trust bill deweese does not
1276119 once the public trust is shattered it can never be put back together
1276120 bill deweeses presence as the leader of our caucus the face of our caucus dramatically undermines that effort to expand our majority and may even compromise it
1276121 esto es sorprendente dado que an lisis anteriores de la superficie marciana han sido consistentes pero no concluyentes sobre la presencia de perclorato

1276130 the malaysian chinese photojournalist association mcpa is exploring the possibility of boycotting all future pkr events to protest the partys attitude towards press photographers
1276131 in a statement today mcpa said that the latest incident involving pkr security personnel manhandling a photographer showed that party leadership has failed to control their officers despite previous complaints being made
1276132 the association said that it has on several occasions raised their concerns of photographers to pkr and that the latter had promised to take steps to resolve the matter
1276133 mcpa deeply regrets that pkrs top leadership has failed to look into their shortcomings and allowed similar acts of violence to be perpetuated this is highly unprofessional
1276134 we will try our best in avoiding such incidences in the future
1276135 there has been a tremendous movement in the oil price and thats pretty much the major story the personal income and spending numbers were much stronger than expected as well as the factory orders these will go into the computation of the second quarter gdp number
1276136 it has dramatically changed the way we run our lives
1276137 if you dont quit something bad will happen to you
1276138 until recently universities and professional societies have ducked out of this because they dont want to be lightning rods for extremists
1276139 far fewer incidents of harassment have been directed at our faculty
1276140 perpetrators must be stopped using whatever means necessary and the use of force is a morally righteous tactic furthermore it is the most likely tactic to be effective in halting these atrocities
1276141 with a broad brush it makes everyone who cares about animals look like an extremist and that plays into the hands of people who exploit them they are able to discredit what we do
1276142 me and him washington are both competing for the same job
1276143 but in this defense the starter gets the same amount of reps as the second string

1276150 the first thing about rolando is that he plays very very very intelligent
1276151 i mean in an extreme way both across campus in a classroom its reflected in how he goes about that and also on the football field he just understands the game almost from a coachs eyes then you put on top of that he has an unbelievable amount of ability and hes big and strong so that can be a lethal combination
1276152 its been a lot better going to practice knowing most of the defense theres less stress the learning process is the hardest part to me
1276153 ive been riding four wheelers and dirt bikes all my life
1276154 it was the same as a dirt bike to me just a little bigger and a little faster

1276156 yeah ill ride a bike again i just respect a motorcycle more now
1276157 theres not much you can say to a guy who was beat up like i was beat up
1276158 my mom wouldnt say that im lucky she says that im blessed that god was watching over me
1276159 i believe it is imperative that bill deweese resign as house majority leader

1276165 were hoping this puts everything poo related behind us so that we can focus on the real issue which is the fact that the democrats are part of a crappy system oppresses and coerces communities into a capitalist economy and undemocratic government

1276195 this landmark legislation will help level the playing field between card holders and card companies and give consumers the tools they need to responsibly manage their own credit
1276196 the substantive reforms in this bill are needed now more than ever if unfair credit card industry practices continue to go unchecked just as subprime mortgages were it will have far reaching and detrimental effects on families and the economy
1276197 by incorporating into statute the initial proposal on credit cards put forth by regulators the committee has denied itself the benefit of valuable public input and agency expertise on the potential consequences of such proposals
1276198 a deliberative agency rule making process would provide this benefit and would avoid bad policy results that harm consumers
1276199 the feds work doesnt diminish congress responsibility to act in the best interest of our constituents and pass meaningful reforms that bear the force of law
1276200 it encourages the fed not to back down and make the rules any less strict
1276201 things that appear attractive on the surface often come with too high a price tag
1276202 if lenders are limited in their ability to adjust interest for customers whose risk levels may have changed they will have to account for the increased risk by raising prices for everyone thats unfair

1276204 so it would imply that people who have a mutation in this gene and are susceptible to cancer have inherently regions of their dna which are duplicated or deleted and therefore are unstable

1276288 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem

1276298 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1276299 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1276300 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1276301 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1276302 we will have to reflect with calmness and tranquility on the future of the olympic torch relay
1276303 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1276304 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1276305 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1276306 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1276307 after these incidents we are convinced more than ever that we need to cherish and preserve the flame
1276308 we must make all efforts to make sure these incidents are never repeated again it is a hope i dont know if it will become a reality
1276309 i am convinced the games will be a great success and will be well organized
1276310 nunca lo dejas del todo siempre te vuelve a apetecer
1276311 in short and simple terms we would be plunged into a depression that would make the great depression of the 1930s in which i spent my childhood look like boom times
1276312 industries would fail banks would collapse government revenues would dry up universities would have to close health care even as limited as it now is for roughly 75 million americans would virtually cease in short something like what the south suffered at the end of the civil war would plague the country
1276313 irans leaders would do well to rethink their gamble and suspend their nuclear program
1276314 barring this the best they could hope for is that israels conventional air assault will destroy their nuclear facilities
1276315 to be sure this would mean thousands of iranian casualties and international humiliation but the alternative is an iran turned into a nuclear wasteland
1276316 we are a new type of law firm with an innovative business model which allows our staff and consultants to be able competently to work on client matters from any location at any time
1276317 we needed a system that would really empower everyone enabling them to work from multiple locations with easy access to exactly the same functionality and performance as is available in a traditional office working environment that was an enormous challenge we wanted to create a professional culture of work as an activity and not just an office location
1276318 the traditional outsourced it models traditionally available also failed to live up to our initial expectations
1276319 such alternatives were hugely expensive and simply not viable for an operation such as ours dedicated to passing cost savings on to its clients we were convinced that there had to be another way and thankfully we discovered intercepts subscription computing solution
1276320 one thing was also clear any solution had to be scalable to meet our rapid growth expectations while keeping a tight reign on costs
1276321 and intercepts onlinedesktop service exceeded and continues to exceed our expectations
1276322 our migration to microsoft office 2007 was a completely painless process the next step is to work with intercept on a voice solution in so doing we will be able to deliver a truly virtual unified communications service to our clients and be on longer reliant on an office based answering service now that is the future of work

1276377 sen obama told the american people what he thought you wanted to hear i told you the truth
1276378 what sen mccain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years he was in washington for 26 of them and in all that time he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil
1276379 after years of inaction and in the face of public frustration over rising gas prices
1276380 we simply cannot pretend as sen mccain does that we can drill our way out of this problem
1276381 make no mistake the oil companies have placed their bet on sen mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy

1276406 middle east e gaming development survey results have always been difficult to gauge
1276407 but we consulted many unaffiliated survey groups institutions of higher learning and professional demographic firms about how to create a quality middle east e gaming development survey that would produce great results
1276408 were psyched about this project and want to make it an annual event
1276409 and our plans are already in motion to secure a survey facility data analysis bureau and publishers for next year

1276485 there is another interesting protection for equity sellers if an equity buyer is represented by an agent the agent must have a bond from an admitted insurer in an amount equal to twice the fair market value of the property but no insurer admitted in california offers such a bond so agents should avoid representing equity buyers

1276936 it is even worse for those running butcheries outside the municipal abattoir for they have to pay an extra sh400 000 as rental fees
1276937 imagine paying all that when one has not been working for a month
1276938 this means cattle traders and farmers are all feeling the pinch
1276939 we have identified the need to improve the supply side in agriculture which entails the timeous supply of critical inputs such as seed fertilizers agro chemicals and fuel
1276940 all these efforts are being undertaken so that success is achieved against all the many challenges facing the agriculture sector as witnessed by the challenging winter wheat programme
1276941 we have already established strategies to bring stability to agriculture through farmer support systems
1276942 as government we have geared ourselves towards addressing power shortages inadequate supplies of critical inputs of fertilizer agro and livestock chemicals fuel stockfeeds and veterinary supplies for this summer cropping season
1276943 consultations are ongoing to improve the prices prevailing on the international market with the intention of making local agriculture competitive and attractive to our farmers
1276944 this importation has to come to an end the nation cannot continue to depend on food grown by farmers from other regional countries like malawi zambia and south africa when we have our own capable and experienced farmers
1276945 in the low density suburbs they will start with domestic workers only maybe it is because some of the house owners can afford to buy most of the commodities but the issue would be looked into so that they low density house owners would also benefit
1276946 in the low density suburbs only the gardeners and housemaids will benefit house owners in the low density suburbs would start benefiting during the next phase currently there are no teams on the ground who are collecting the names of the housemaids and gardeners but they would be there soon
1276947 i welcome the move since it benefits most of the people in this area and if the space is not enough i am prepared to provide more space for the warehouses
1276948 the exercise is going on well and the people are very happy with the coming of the programme in this area they are very co operative and grateful to the government
1276949 sometimes when our teams are on the ground they dont find people at their homes since most of them would have gone to various places like mbare musika
1276950 but we would like to urge them to come to the epworth local board offices around 4pm so that their names would be recorded
1276951 the government for the past seven seasons has played a pivotal role in supporting the new farmer as a strategy to get his feet into a sector that was dominated by a few individuals it is within this context that failure to ensure productivity in agriculture should be taken as a great betrayal to the ideals and principles of the leaders who have been pillars of this revolution
1276952 the market pricing might not be favourable but a strategic farmer is one who projects his productivity for the next three to five seasons and plans for it today sets a solid foundation today and sees opportunities when others are sleeping
1276953 i fully support the view that we can be different in our thinking but we are zimbabweans first with an unquestionable capacity to champion our desired economic and political destiny
1276954 i am positive that our zimbabwean brothers and sisters will come out of the talks with a sumptuous package for the benefit of all zimbabweans
1276955 the entry fee is a bit steep considering that cash is hard to come by if you have a family of six you need well over 1 trillion 100 revalued
1276956 absenteeism has increased alarmingly because most pupils do not get food at homes those who attend school cant concentration on studies due to hunger the mp said
1276957 unlike the political internal refugees these are people who were displaced by cattle rustlers and have undergone untold suffering since 2005
1276958 i have lost 20 head of cattle to the famine it is the worst i have seen

1277093 excessive and continuous use of chemical and inorganic fertilizers has a harmful effect on soil health it produces an imbalance in plant nutrients of the soil which affects the acidity or alkalinity of soils and reduces its fertility gradually
1277094 some organic fertilizers are high in one of the three major nutrients nitrogen phosphorus or potash but low or zero in the other two some are low in all three macronutrients the ingredients used to fortify organic fertilizers are organic materials for example rock phosphate to increase phosphorus or greensand to increase potash
1277095 the use of organic fertilizers as means of improvement of the fertility and productivity of land for farming is feasible and desirable whether we like it or not we are getting into a situation in agriculture where we shall intensify the use of agro chemicals to solve the problem of food insecurity but our farmers are poor and can not afford inorganic fertilizers organic fertilizers provide short and long term means of maintaining the land fertile
1277096 organic products fetch high prices in international markets and this should encourage the farmers to intensify generation utilization and application of organic fertilizers the world has increasingly realized that excessive use of chemicals may lead to poor health of the people that eat the food
1277097 we told you they are reminding those who care to listen that gm products should largely benefit humanity through boosting food production in terms of quality and quantity specifically today to prevent the food crisis

1277115 youre beautiful but would be more so if you lost weight
1277116 youre so ungrateful i helped you out youll miss me when i die
1277117 theres a lot of people participating already in diving and with the olympics coming theres going to be of course a lot of interest in the sport
1277118 our numbers for learn to dive usually i wouldnt say double but certainly go up i would say maybe 30 to 40 per cent
1277119 the body regions that were most injured were the head and neck along with injuries to the face this accounts for about 60 per cent of all the diving related injuries
1277120 and specifically the types of injuries that we saw were lacerations soft tissue injuries were the most common diagnoses followed by strains and sprains and fractures
1277121 about 77 per cent were forward facing about 22 per cent were backward
1277122 more than 80 per cent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to a metre so thats not very high
1277123 about 17 per cent were injured at a dive height of greater than one metre
1277124 once i slipped off the board i wasnt doing a dive i was just not paying attention and it was very early in the morning i scraped my shin but that was about it
1277125 if youre going to a country club pool or a recreational type pool or a backyard pool youre not going to have the same kind of safety that you would have at a training centre that is teaching the sport competitively
1277126 because if youre using the correct technique really the incidence of any kind of injury is quite rare

1277128 the golden age of refining is behind us and we are entering the dark ages
1277129 for the first time in this decade we believe the u s stock market is primed to outperform the global stock market in the near term
1277130 u s stocks valuations are about as good as any in the world
1277131 most u s companies are well managed and cash rich the u s economy is close to a bottom foreign economies are starting to soften and foreign investors have an opportunity to make money two ways on u s stocks from capital gains and a stronger dollar
1277132 why were so many vanguard investors pouring billions of dollars into the index each month i blame a large part of the mess they are in today on the relentless pitches coming from jack bogle vanguards founder and others at vanguard that one should simply set it and forget it buying an index fund and leaving the driving to the markets
1277133 no he was hedging to vanguards total stock market index fund
1277134 i predicted last summer that this would be my 10th bear market
1277135 but this one is different the others were more marketlike reflecting problems in the market not problems in the society and the economy as this one does as a result were in for a much more troublesome era than after the other big bear markets

1277255 the longer it goes on they actually draw strength from that
1277256 it is now clear that that was not the case and that the initial forensic science service report had said the findings were inconclusive
1277257 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1277258 the trust has identified a total of 19 new cases of clostridium difficile in july 2008
1277259 this is a reduction of four on the previous month and the trend shows a continuing fall in the rate of new infections this is the lowest number of new infection cases in the trust for more than 12 months
1277260 we are however seeing an increase in the number of relapsed cases
1277261 this is a reflection of the nature of the illness that can reoccur in some patients for several months depending on the patients primary condition and whether there is a need to prescribe further antibiotic treatment
1277262 all of these patients have low levels of immunity to infection
1277263 in recent months the trend was in the right direction and in june the belfast trust was meeting its targets for c difficile
1277264 in july however this trend reversed and we had 58 cases recorded this compared with 27 in the previous month
1277265 today the figure is 28 patients with symptoms associated with c difficile infection

1277650 airline tickets are already expensive enough without having to pay to check your luggage
1277651 our 3 1 1 kits make it easy for travelers to pack their personal care items inside their carry on bags and avoid having to check bags altogether
1277652 plus packing all toiletries into a one quart bag saves a lot of space not to mention weight and it goes without saying traveling with just a carry on means theres no chance of losing your luggage and you can bypass baggage claim altogether
1277653 we have just returned from our trip and wanted to let you know how much we appreciated the 3 1 1 compliant kit this is an excellent product perfectly functional and well made the tubes never leaked all our creams and gels were labeled and well organized throughout our travels and we breezed through airport security with them were sold on this kit and would never go back to using standard travel bottles thank you
1277654 this kit is very easy to use i was able to repackage all of my essential toiletries within an hour i recommend this kit to anyone who cannot find their essential toiletries in the required 3 oz size or who refuses to pay the premium for the smaller tubes
1277655 simple convenient and affordable and more importantly its the exact rapid fat loss cardio system i use with my paying clients to have them consistently lose 2 3 lbs of fat per week like clockwork
1277656 my clients were loving the results from the interval training workouts but they kept complaining that it was such a pain in the butt to always have to look at the clock to know when to stop or start and often they couldnt even listen to music because they had to listen for the annoying beep of their stopwatches i knew we had to find a way to fuse our rapid fat loss interval timelines with music and follow along audio instructions and thats when i found topher
1277657 there has long been a direct relationship between workout intensity and workout music what we have done is provided the appropriate music for each part of the workout to generate the appropriate user response the warm up music essentially prepares the mind and body for battle the workout music contains adrenaline racing heart pumping tracks that will have the user exerting optimal training intensity the cool down music relaxes and winds the user down for the rest of the day plus the audio instructions eliminate the need for a stopwatch allowing the consumer to workout in a distraction free environment
1277658 after pressing play on my ipod all i have to do is enjoy the music and respond to the seamless transitions nothing could be easier my cardio workouts have simply gone to that next level and i will never go back to being a slave to my watch again i have lost 80 scale pounds my pant size has gone from a 42 44 to a 34 36 and instead of wearing xxl shirts i am now wearing l xl i also no longer need to take medication for blood pressure or sleep apnea this experience has totally changed my life
1277659 i look forward to having professionals throughout the world join us for our complimentary medical spa webinars with topics that include recession proof your medspa marketing to build medspa success top 10 reasons medical spas succeed

1277674 many investors are placing part of their hard earned money out of harms way into foreign banks that do not have exposure to the u s sub prime mortgage crises
1277675 many investors are placing part of their hard earned money out of harms way into foreign banks that do not have exposure to the u s sub prime mortgage crises
1277676 the first step in establishing a foreign account is to establish an offshore company since many foreign banks will not open accounts directly with u s people or companies the next step is to open the bank account in the offshore company name
1277677 it is very important to note that u s people are taxed on worldwide income so this is not a tax avoidance strategy it is a fully reported financial diversification and asset protection move the u s and many other governments are cracking down on those whom use offshore trusts in an attempt to avoid paying taxes or hide money from their governments offshore company ensures that its clients offshore trusts are set up and filed properly and meet government legal requirements
1277678 dont try setting up an offshore trust by yourself unless you are experienced with offshore banking use a professional service that understands the offshore banking laws as well as the laws of your government remember the government will go after people that not only try to hide their accounts from the government but those that make mistakes setting up the trusts or improperly file the paper work as well ignorance is not an excuse that will save you from governmental action and when you are dealing with a large amount of money and very stiff penalties for mistakes why take chances
1277679 it is clear that the potential of genetic testing to drive health and lifestyle decisions has captured the imagination of many analysis of online searches conducted across our network shows a remarkable awareness of the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 otherwise known as gina and its implications for the protection of consumers rights
1277680 in just a few short years there has been a dramatic shift in individuals attitudes and a growing understanding of the long term effects of lifestyle choices it is logical that the explosive growth in services such as personalized training and personalized medicine would lead to a rapid understanding of the benefits provided by personalized genetics as the testing market matures and regulatory compliant genetics testing labs grow their databases the promised health benefits are enormous bridging the health and lifestyle divide are the possibilities offered by using genetic dating to determine sexual attraction and compatibility at the fun and hobby end of the spectrum there is huge interest in genealogy and genetic testing today the potential to use combined dna databases to build or expand family trees is enormous
1277681 since the enactment of the hipaa legislation at the start of the decade privacy and ethics issues have been an increasingly important aspect of healthcare education and nursing degrees several states have dna testing legislation with new york acting earlier this year to warn 31 genetic labs that they are in breach of state regulations and california ordering thirteen laboratories to cease operations as gina takes full force it is clear that confidence in the benefits of dna analysis will grow
1277682 the potential to avoid a broken heart through genetic dating or a failed heart through early medical intervention is just to tempting to ignore

1277717 researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1277718 the researchers traced ascorbates anti cancer effect to the formation of hydrogen peroxide in the extracellular fluid surrounding the tumors normal cells were unaffected
1277719 when you eat foods containing more than 200 milligrams of vitamin c a day for example two oranges and a serving of broccoli your body prevents blood levels of ascorbate from exceeding a narrow range
1277720 injected ascorbate into the veins or abdominal cavities of rodents with aggressive brain ovarian and pancreatic tumors
1277721 up to four grams per kilogram of body weight daily
1277722 the researchers discovered that high concentrations of ascorbate had anticancer effects in 75 percent of cancer cell lines tested while sparing normal cells
1277723 in immune deficient mice with rapidly spreading ovarian pancreatic and glioblastoma brain tumors the ascorbate injections reduced tumor growth and weight by 41 to 53 percent

1277768 by the mid 1990s scientists had identified genes that might lead to both conditions neuroticism and depression
1277769 although we may wish it to be true we do not have and are not likely to ever discover genes for psychiatric illness

1277776 harper gives 14 billion in corporate tax cuts but our cities scramble the ndp would have taken a balanced approached

1277793 the harper government will have to explain to everyday canadians why he chose a 14 billion dollar corporate tax cut over adequate funding for our cities
1277794 after years of liberal negligence the infrastructure deficit is now 123 billion cities have started to increase property taxes to provide a basic service to their people and once again average canadians are footing the bill
1277795 its about our drinking water facilities our sewage systems the safety of our roads and bridges
1277796 they are all crumbling and municipalities cant keep up with the repairs why should homeowners have to pay up to 30 more for property taxes because of this governments bad decisions while their cities crumble
1277797 when the uns special rapporteur on adequate housing miloon kothari recently condemned canada for its lack of action to address canadas housing crisis all canadians have every reason to believe their federal government has let them down
1277798 there are currently 1 5 million canadians without adequate affordable housing report after report show its the most vulnerable who struggle to pay for a roof over their heads new immigrants lone parent families the elderly aboriginals and young adults are the hardest hit by the lack of affordable housing
1277799 canadians were let down by the liberals who slashed affordable housing funding in the mid 1990s and now by the conservatives who have stubbornly refused to put canada back on the right track when it comes to providing canadians with quality affordable housing
1277800 its shameful that on national housing day canada doesnt have a national housing strategy
1277801 today all opposition parties joined with us to move one step closer to building the foundation for a truly national non profit affordable and high quality child care program
1277802 this minority parliament can leave a strong legacy for all our children by taking these positive steps to support working and middle class families and combat child poverty
1277803 with big box child care at our doorsteps this bill is timely and important we need to make sure that foreign multinational corporations dont profit off the backs of average canadian parents
1277804 across canada parents are struggling to find affordable child care spaces and quality centres for their children
1277805 were putting the priorities of middle class and working families first and addressing their needs with practical solutions like this child care act
1277806 ultimately we know deeply that the other side of every fear is a freedom
1277807 we did a beautiful experiment but it definitely was a disappointment
1277808 the merck setback means that 25 years into the aids epidemic doctors are still far from having a protective vaccine an international team of scientists has been recruited to determine precisely what went wrong
1277809 it calls into question all the vaccines using related strategies that have been leading the field
1277810 i dont think anyone imagined the results would be so definitively negative so quickly
1277811 the researchers said not enough data existed to determine the meaning of the findings about the vaccine which is made by merck the increased risk was principally among a group of people who had pre existing levels of immunity to a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 5 which was modified to become a critical part of the vaccine researchers emphasized that the vaccine itself could not cause aids one theory is that the cold virus may have activated the immune system in some way to make certain recipients more susceptible to becoming h i v infected when they were exposed to the aids virus
1277812 apathy is the glove into which evil slips its hand
1277813 freedom is what you do with whats been done to you
1277814 only a large scale popular movement toward decentralization and self help can arrest the present tendency toward statism a really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced because they love their servitude to make them love it is the task assigned in present day totalitarian states to ministries of propaganda newspaper editors and schoolteachers
1277815 freedom is what you do with whats been done to you
1277816 freedom is what you do with whats been done to you
1277817 people do not believe lies because they have to but because they want to
1277818 can we truly expect those who aim to exploit us to be trusted to educate us
1277819 no duty however binds us to these so called laws whose corrupting influence menaces what is noblest in our being
1277820 liberty has never come from the government liberty has always come from the subjects of government the history of liberty is the history of resistance the history of liberty is a history of the limitation of governmental power not the increase of it
1277821 non cooperation with evil is as much a duty as is cooperation with good
1277822 advocates of capitalism are very apt to appeal to the sacred principles of liberty which are embodied in one maxim the fortunate must not be restrained in the exercise of tyranny over the unfortunate
1277823 to sin by silence when they should protest makes cowards of men
1277824 the objector and the rebel who raises his voice against what he believes to be the injustice of the present and the wrongs of the past is the one who hunches the world along
1277825 the right to defy an unconstitutional statute is basic in our scheme even when an ordinance requires a permit to make a speech to deliver a sermon to picket to parade or to assemble it need not be honored when its invalid on its face
1277826 we are reluctant to admit that we owe our liberties to men of a type that today we hate and fear unruly men disturbers of the peace men who resent and denounce what whitman called the insolence of elected persons in a word free men
1277827 count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth having
1277828 the only fence against the world is a thorough knowledge of it
1277829 war is just a racket a racket is best described i believe as something that is not what it seems to the majority of people only a small inside group knows what it is about it is conducted for the benefit of the very few at the expense of the masses
1277830 the war made possible for us the solution of a whole series of problems that could never have been solved in normal times
1277831 we judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing while others judge us by what we have already done
1277832 no free government or the blessings of liberty can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice moderation temperance frugality and virtue and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles
1277833 and i honor the man who is willing to sink half his present repute for the freedom to think and when he has thought be his cause strong or weak will risk t other half for the freedom to speak
1277834 one death is a tragedy but a million deaths are a statistic
1277835 it may be your intent to be our masters how can it be ours to be your slaves
1277836 it is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere
1277837 by far the most dangerous foe we have to fight is apathy indifference from whatever cause not from a lack of knowledge but from carelessness from absorption in other pursuits from a contempt bred of self satisfaction
1277838 when a man has so far corrupted and prostituted the chastity of his mind as to subscribe his professional belief to things he does not believe he has prepared himself for the commission of every other crime
1277839 then what is freedom it is the will to be responsible to ourselves
1277840 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
1277841 if the machine of government is of such a nature that it requires you to be the agent of injustice to another then i say break the law
1277842 a state which dwarfs its men in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands even for beneficial purposes will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished
1277843 it is dangerous to be right when the government is wrong

1277845 we are fast approaching the stage of the ultimate inversion the stage where the government is free to do anything it pleases while the citizens may act only by permission which is the stage of the darkest periods of human history the stage of rule by brute force
1277846 those who think history has left us helpless should recall the abolitionist of 1830 the feminist of 1870 the labor organizer of 1890 and the gay or lesbian writer of 1910 they like us did not get to choose their time in history but they like us did get to choose what they did with it knowing what we know now about how these things turned out but also knowing how long it took would we have been abolitionists in 1830 or feminists in 1870 and so on
1277847 it should be no surprise that when rich men take control of the government they pass laws that are favorable to themselves the surprise is that those who are not rich vote for such people even though they should know from bitter experience that the rich will continue to rip off the rest of us perhaps the reason is that rich men are very clever at covering up what they do
1277848 an imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics

1277872 when looking closely at the construction and content of the hrsd it is clear that this is a flawed measure

1277904 if we dont keep their phone call records it is very likely that the terrorists may escape easily after executing blasts in the city we appeal to people to cooperate with the police
1277905 we are very particular about cyber cafes after the series of blasts in jaipur bangalore and ahmedabad the terrorists have used cyber cafes before executing those blasts
1277906 in ahmedabad terrorists have not even spared hospitals and they exploded bombs there when media people and relatives of affected persons in the bomb blasts at various places gathered in the hospital
1277907 in view of the terrorist attacks at the hospitals we have written letters to aiims and safdarjung hospitals for strengthening security in and around their premises

1277912 the term carbon finance is used in practice as well as in the course title as a surrogate for climate change finance to cover wide ranging financial responses to mitigate and adapt to climate change

1277916 twelve percent is the highest in pierce county and i have the lowest revenue

1277919 enacted in accordance with state law and the town councils own rules of procedure
1277920 i think the delay is evidence that its hard to get any relief from the court given their limitations on hearing matters that are of an emergency nature
1277921 the festival is a wonderful thing in our community and we should be careful to not lose the things we really value

1277923 further governor gregoire should suspend salary negotiations with state employee groups over pay increases until we know the full extent of our deficit next year
1277924 i am asking each of you to step up your efforts to increase savings i ask that you be creative and take action now
1277925 the high price of energy is hurting our businesses and our families anything we can do to reduce fuel consumption will ease the burden on our budget and on taxpayers
1277926 its across the board except for exemptions for certain public safety positions
1277927 to me its clearly not a matter of deep conviction or she wouldnt have waited so long to do so
1277928 i dont know which she is more afraid of the looming deficit her overspending created or the rossi for governor campaign but clearly one or the other or both motivated her decision today
1277929 whatever works as long as they are doing it because it needs to get done
1277930 you cant just keep waiting and hoping and dreaming that things will get better youve got to deal with the freshest information that tells us we have got to start doing that now so im glad to see the governor is doing some things that will help us to better manage our budget problems next year

1277940 the london 2012 bid team paid for me to attend the international olympic committee meeting in singapore which awarded the games to london in order to demonstrate the cross party support for the bid
1277941 so its a shame that weve got to finance the trip to beijing ourselves since its the only opportunity to see what is involved in running the games on the ground before we are potentially having to run it ourselves
1277942 given that there is cross party support for the project its disappointing that the government wont even pay for one of us to be there especially since five ministers are being sent at public expense
1277943 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills you know

1277953 the kids would sit there and throw stuff and cuss out the teacher when i came here it was a whole different environment the kids were actually caring about their education

1277968 in my mind mr newman made a stupid and inappropriate comment and perhaps in the future he will be more careful about what he chooses to say ms wriedt said in a statement
1277969 i have received numerous emails today expressing disgust at what mr newman said and i would point out that many of these have been sent by men concerned at the nature of the comments
1277970 there was never any intention to insult paula wriedt and any suggestion to the contrary is grossly unfair
1277971 sam newman was simply suggesting ms wriedt should be a guest on the
1277972 sam qualified this moments later when he realised hed been taken out of context
1277973 sam is horrified at suggestions he made a lewd remark about ms wriedt and phoned her to clarify his comment

1277976 we have been advised that six foot is not large for a boa constrictor however people should not touch it or attempt to pick it up by the tail as these snakes do bite
1277977 we believe the snake will be looking for a damp dark and warm location and as it had been recently fed it will be fairly lethargic they are also excellent swimmers
1277978 i didnt know whether or not to give manny a high five after he struck out in the seventh because they were cheering him pretty good out there
1277979 hes got some stiffness and well just see what it is i didnt think it was anything serious just because the velocity was still there
1277980 if people saw me theyd probably think i was a nut
1277981 does it translate into hits i dont know ultimately i have to take a good swing and square the ball up
1277982 but i do know that it makes me feel prepared and not feeling prepared is the worst thing that can happen you need to feel good going into an at bat you cant go up there with any doubt i want to think that preparation is a huge help thats why i do it
1277983 for reserve players some of the resources they have these days are a godsend
1277984 pitchers have just as much information as the hitter does
1277985 you have to force yourself to stay in the game
1277986 its a mind set the years when i had the most success i had a manager who would find a way to get me a start now and then so i could get at bats and stay fresh
1277987 i think that helps greg he can play multiple positions and manager charlie manuel can get him a start now and then to keep him sharp
1277988 the other thing i think helps greg is his work ethic i saw it in spring training he puts in quality time in the cage its not just eyewash hes a tremendous asset to that team
1277989 you get one shot usually late in a game in a critical situation against a tough pitcher its a tough job its almost like being a field goal kicker these guys are specialists dobbs is very good at what he does
1277990 pat being familiar with me and believing in me has been a blessing
1277991 in this great game if thats my role i wont fight it
1277992 to implement the policy we are talking of about 500 students affected by the problem of overstaying
1277993 many of these students have been studying and writing course works in preparation for examinations
1277994 students who have been affected most are those on masters and phd programmes who take longer to submit their dissertations than their undergraduate counterparts
1277995 a student who has overstayed on an academic programme by more that two years shall be discontinued from his her studies at the university
1277996 a student will be allowed only a maximum of two withdrawals on an academic programme and each withdrawal shall be a maximum of one academic year only
1277997 ensure that the students qualifications have a currency at the time of graduation
1277998 it is common knowledge that courses in most programmes have been changing within an interval of two years

1278010 injuries are such a key element today because with the contracts payrolls and overall lack of talent nobody has that much depth
1278011 probably most teams can piece it together if they lose one or two integral guys but if you get beyond that its tough
1278012 i think its just being very lucky i think things have to fall right for you
1278013 i think we were really unlucky last year to some extent
1278014 but we also made some changes that we think have helped weve tried to be proactive
1278015 if youre talking about something like what happened to jimmy rollins youre talking about luck his ankle caught when he was in a bad position thats an injury that cant be controlled
1278016 then there are some you might be able to predict maybe you have some guys in spring training and their shoulder is a little tighter than youd like thats kind of a crapshoot

1278021 all the more so if the idea was to do him a favour by not associating in the public mind a boob with someone who is how to say susceptible to female charm

1278266 find the twelve rabbits in this picture exercises ever concocted at least since finnegans wake to something stronger and more evocative banish all thoughts of that bruckheimer movie surely the howard the duck of the early 21st century and cleave to the real stuff its an altogether admirable work and yet and yet if this is to be an apologia por vita fabula some things began to bother me about this summa while the vision of the blazing world is an immense vista with multiple hints as to its escher and blivit multidimensionality its a place crowded to bursting with figures back in the unblazered world of the league though the war of the worlds happened but was dealt with and the events of orwells 1984 did occur but only lasted a few years and was pretty much confined to england and something in me balked especially at the latter it is true i realized that the events could have been just that localized and temporary yet still look global and eternal to winston smith nonetheless said the little voice is that the best use to which orwells fiction could be put is wellss vision of a world laid waste and humbled really served well by making it a brief upheaval best characterized as abortive if you dont count the marvel and dc universes loeg has two antecedents i know of the first the construct of phillip jos farmer who in his books tarzan alive and doc savage his apocalyptic life created a genealogy of adventure characters linking tarzan sherlock holmes the shadow james bond and many others into one great system the other and slightly more obscure one was john myers myers silverlock which created a magical land where characters of fiction lived but surprised me into appreciation by including figures like manon lescaut along side robin hood and using it to muse somberly about the meaning and fate of man farmers play and i have to take a second to pay tribute to a real multidimensional and audacious writer in addition to his fictional games hes written daringly sexual sf and stylistically daring work hes not only the real writer of kilgore trouts published novel venus on the half shell but he also ghost wrote a story by trouts favorite sf writer jonathan swift somers iii resonated so widely because there really was a deep connection between the figures he talks about why shouldnt g 8 and his battle aces foil a plot by fu manchu why shouldnt james bond and the shadow meet i mean doesnt that sound cool i mean the way bertie wooster meeting cthulhu doesnt the point is that in addition to building characters fiction writers build worlds they dont have to look like middle earth dune or gormenghast it can be something like blandings castle or john updikes suburbia or endless chain of barrooms they can borrow a an off the shelf world in the same way one can yank out several standard characters from the box in back marked teen angst and cynical artists its an important and i put it to you coeval and coequal part with building heroes and antiheroes smoke ring its a sequel to the integral trees a novel that created an exceedingly strange and fully realized world arising it always seemed to me out of the discoveries about the dynamics of jupiters volcanic moon io niven sets up a torus of gas in rotation around a neutron star creating an ecology whose natural state is that of free fall with nothing like earth or sky he built an environment of enormous trees shaped like the integration extended s and then he peopled it with a bunch of flavorless characters whose adventures were almost totally determined by interesting aspects of the created world i read the integral trees when it came out and have waited with the sequel until now ive even reread some of my favorite niven sooner than this and regrettably the balance has not shifted both figures and worlds participate in fiction science fiction fantasy satire and comedy all use their worlds for important purposes while romance adventure tragedy and drama focus more strongly on the figures its purely my personal preference i think that ive always been far more excited by a map than a portrait and so may be just an idiosyncratic objection to alan and kevins blazing world would i not far rather see a vast pan dimensional manifold of worlds to wander in even ones like the ingsoc airstrip one or the updikean air conditioned nightmare the answer is clearly stop youre both right

1278408 there are still dark corners of the labour market where rogue employers seek to mistreat their workers and more needs to be done to safeguard peoples rights
1278409 we want to prevent unscrupulous employers who undercut honest competition and prey on people who are fearful or so desperate to earn a living that they are open to exploitation
1278410 it is disappointing that ministers are not prepared to extend the coverage of the gangmasters licensing authority gla to cover other vulnerable sectors such as construction care and hospitality
1278411 nor has the government been prepared to examine the legal loophole that deprives many workers from gaining the legal status of an employee which stops their entitlement to many rights and allows an employer to sack them with no comeback if they attempt to enforce the limited rights they enjoy
1278412 this effort aims to go beyond mere prevention by promoting ongoing treatment for mothers and their babies
1278413 our aim is to fund the most effective and appropriate medicines and diagnostics on the market for both women and children
1278414 for the first time fewer people are dying of aids and fewer people are becoming infected with hiv but the end of aids is nowhere in sight
1278415 substantial progress has been made on treatment but the prevention message isnt getting through despite our best efforts
1278416 we are anxious about the affordability of this programme we need cheaper drugs cheaper diagnostic tools but most importantly we need to make hiv prevention effective
1278417 religious leaders have immense power imagine the pope or religious leaders speaking out widely on condoms as life saving devices and other advocacy issues like travel restrictions for people living with hiv when we see religious leaders standing up and addressing sensitive issues like these things will shift
1278418 i am absolutely convinced that we as religious leaders and we in the religious community that so shunned and shamed people with hiv and struggling with aids must begin first by engaging in public acts of repentance because absent public acts of repentance i fear our words will not be trusted
1278419 i was not even able to negotiate the use of a condom
1278420 i was so devastated that i thought i would soon die in a foreign country without my family knowing where i was buried
1278421 most countries still have a long way to go to meet the goal
1278422 just as important in most countries stigma against people living with hiv remains a grave challenge
1278423 they are wonderfully courageous and motivated people and should serve as an example to us all on how to act with dignity in the face of adversity
1278424 that they should be discriminated against including through restrictions on their ability to travel between countries should fill us with shame
1278425 this is cause for encouragement but not cause for complacency nor for declaring victory
1278426 because the end of aids is nowhere in sight every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral treatment
1278427 some of the nuclear weapon free zone treaties have not yet entered into force several signatories have yet to complete the ratification or accession process whole regions have been unable to establish such zones including the middle east and some nuclear weapon states have not concluded the relevant protocols
1278428 clearly there is still much work to do before we achieve our shared goal of a nuclear weapon free world
1278429 telephone interpreting is used by countless hospitals and health care facilities throughout the world
1278430 our goal is to help our members and the public at large to learn more about this important method of delivering language access to patients across the globe
1278431 the results of this trial show that telemedicine is efficacious for making acute medical decisions stroke telemedicine is widely implemented and discussed but despite its dissemination its efficacy has not previously been shown our results support the use of telemedicine to make urgent treatment decisions such as whether to use thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke
1278432 the next step is to show that telethrombolysis is equivalent to or better than the gold standard treatment to improve the percentage of patients with no handicap at three months this would represent top level evidence for using and developing telemedicine for equal and improved access to alteplase in all patients with stroke such a study is currently recruiting patients in france in the meantime the study by meyer and colleagues reinforces that telethrombolysis should be strongly preferred to telephone consultation
1278433 with only about 400 fully qualified interpreters in england to support approximately 70 000 deaf people who use bsl as their first language it can be a real challenge arranging a supported doctors appointment by funding signtranslate to be free for every gp in england we hope that every deaf person will be able to see their doctor when necessary
1278434 we have very effective treatments for cancer in adolescents but they only work if the patient takes them
1278435 this study shows that a strategically designed video game can be a powerful new tool to enhance the impact of medical treatment by motivating healthy behavior in the patient
1278436 we now know that games can induce positive changes in the way individuals manage their health
1278437 the game not only motivates positive health behavior it also gives players a greater sense of power and control over their disease in fact that seems to be its key ingredient
1278438 the process to create and evaluate re mission was highly collaborative often challenging and an incredible learning experience

1278491 baegini dulu ada namanya masyarakat sadum mereka adalah masyarakat yang rendah tingkat moralnya rusak mentalnya tidak mempunyai pegangan agama atau nilai kemanusiaan yang beradab
1278492 seorang pendatang yang masuk ke sadum tidak akan selamat dari diganggu oleh mereka jika ia membawa barang barang yang berharga maka dirampaslah barang barangnya jika ia melawan atau menolak menyerahkannya maka nyawanya tidak akan selamat akan tetapi jika pendatang itu seorang lelaki yang bermuka tampan dan berparas elok maka ia akan menjadi rebutan di antara mereka dan akan menjadi korban perbuatan keji lelakinya dan sebaliknya jika si pendatang itu seorang perempuan muda maka ia menjadi mangsa bagi pihak wanitanya pula allah kemudian menurunkan nabi luth a s nabi luth mengajak mereka beriman dan beribadah kepada allah meninggalkan kebiasaan mungkar menjauhkan diri dari perbuatan maksiat dan kejahatan yang diilhamkan oleh iblis dan syaitan
1278493 nabi luth berseru kepada mereka agar meninggalkan adat kebiasaan yaitu melakukan perbuatan homoseks dan lesbian karena perbuatan itu bertentangan dengan fitrah dan hati nurani manusia serta menyalahi hikmah yang terkandung didalam penciptaan manusia menjadi dua jenis yaitu lelaki dan wanita tetapi mereka masyarakat sadum menentang hal tersebut ternyata istri nbi luth juga ikut ikutan dengan masyarakat sadum dia ternyata musuh dalam selimut beliau memohon kepada allah agar kepada kaumnya masyarakat sadum diberi pengajaran berupa azab di dunia sebelum azab yang menanti mereka di akhirat kelak permohonan nabi luth dan doanya diperkenankan dan dikabulkan oleh allah s w t karena masanya telah tiba bagi azab allah yang akan ditimpakan para malaikat berpesan kepada nabi luth dan keluarganya agar perjalanan ke luar kota jangan seorang pun dari mereka menoleh ke belakang
1278494 nabi luth keluar dari rumahnya sehabis tengah malam bersama keluarganya terdiri dari seorang isteri dan dua puterinya berjalan cepat menuju keluar kota tidak menoleh ke kanan maupun kekiri sesuai dengan petunjuk para malaikat yang menjadi tamunya akan tetapi si isteri yang menjadi musuh dalam selimut bagi nabi luth tidak tergamak meninggalkan kaumnya ia berada dibelakang rombongan nabi luth berjalan perlahan lahan tidak secepat langkah suaminya dan tidak henti henti menoleh ke belakang karena ingin mengetahui apa yang akan menimpa atas kaumnya seakan akan meragukan kebenaran ancaman para malaikat yang telah didengarnya sendiri dan begitu langkah nabi luth berserta kedua puterinya melewati batas kota sadum sewaktu fajar menyingsing bergetarlah bumi dengan dahsyatnya di bawah kaki rakyat sadum tidak terkecuali isteri nabi luth yang munafiq itu getaran itu mendahului suatu gempa bumi yang kuat dan hebat disertai angin yang kencang dan hujan batu sijjil yang menghancurkan dengan serta merta kota sadum berserta semua pemghuninya itulah kejadiannya

1278533 scotland has no more of a problem with alcohol than other countries like england and it would not make a difference to introduce a range of measures to control drinking habits just in scotland
1278534 scotland has a more serious problem with alcohol than other countries and therefore needs separate measures to control its drinking habits
1278535 it is fair to reduce promotions or to make alcohol more expensive in scotland than in england
1278536 it is unfair that in scotland people will have to pay more for their drink in comparison to england

1278547 for many years i have dreamed of being an active participant in the revitalization of nassau and in particular bay street
1278548 with the grand opening of the bacardi store i am very excited to lead the charge of the revitalization of the bay street business and tourist districts with such a high end offering with the clout of the bacardi name and its international appeal were confident this store will serve as a gateway to the east end of bay street
1278549 with the opening of the bacardi store a truly unique retail destination we create a visitor experience that showcases the rich history heritage and passion of the bacardi spirits portfolio for both visitors and those who call nassau home
1278550 to commemorate the grand opening of the bacardi store we are pleased to announce the international launch of bacardi reserva limitada this limited edition product is blended from our rarest rums that have been aged in small mature oak barrels for 10 to 16 years nassau is the first place this rum will be sold outside of puerto rico where it is produced
1278551 nassau and bay street have something very special as this themed retail outlet is the only branded retail outlet in the world designed solely for the sale of bacardi products and accessories
1278552 the fact that a company of the reputation of bacardi would establish a retail store of this quality in nassau speaks volumes of their faith in the destination as a premier tourist attraction with the ability to produce solid business we value our partnership with bacardi and bristol and for our part we are pulling out all the stops to revitalize our product to provide a high quality visitor experience overall
1278553 we are working keenly towards the redevelopment of bay street to reestablish its reputation as one of the premier tourist shopping destinations of the world clearly a facility like the bacardi store will contribute much to cementing that image and providing real value for visitors to nassau the bacardi brand is known and respected worldwide
1278554 restaurants have taken the lead in ensuring food safety within the four walls of our restaurants
1278555 the national restaurant association and our members are making multi billion dollar investments in improving food safety and developing state of the art food safety education programs
1278556 we must look for ways for the government at all levels to collaborate more closely with industry experts during the course of an outbreak investigation and we must establish stronger standards and practices that move us towards continuous improvement in produce safety
1278557 of particular concern is the complexity of the food distribution channels for fresh produce and the challenges presented when a finished product served to consumers like salsa contains a number of ingredients this complexity presented challenges to the public health officials leading the efforts to resolve this outbreak in timely manner in moving forward we need a stronger approach we need a truly farm to table approach supply chain collaboration and coordination has taken on a new urgency and new focus
1278558 our first half performance provides further evidence of the strength of our business model and strategy
1278559 despite significant inflation headwinds we capitalized on our momentum to further increase our investment in future growth we increased our earnings guidance and acquired two businesses in emerging markets within the first half of the year and we continue to utilize our strong cash flow to return profits to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases
1278560 while commodities and the economic outlook remain volatile our business model and strategy give us continued confidence that we will achieve our long term goals
1278561 the june decline in the restaurant performance index was the result of a drop in the current situation component
1278562 restaurant operators reported negative same store sales and customer traffic levels in june after posting somewhat stronger results in may
1278563 the uncertain economy and rising food costs continue to create a challenging business environment for restaurant operators
1278564 a record 29 percent of restaurant operators said the economy is the number one challenge facing their business while 22 percent identified food costs as their top challenge
1278565 we are pleased that these two companies have recognized the strong consumer demand for a stevia sweetened beverage and thanks to their highly publicized race to market this relatively obscure herb is now a household word
1278566 it makes being first to market that much sweeter as consumers in the u s realize that our product represents the first real option to artificially sweetened sodas while the majors battle it out to get to market first were out there selling zevia but we are concerned that truvia and purevia have strikingly similar names to zevia which may result in consumer confusion

1278603 de meeste limburgers kennen het evangelie niet het is voor hen voldoende als ze lid zijn van de kerk deelnemen aan de sacramenten een kaarsje aansteken en maria aanroepen hopelijk komen jullie in contact met limburgers die op zoek zijn naar god
1278604 bij mij thuis komen ook vaak mensen eten de blijde boodschap komt op een spontane manier tijdens het diner naar voren

1278645 reflect its limited geographic diversity difficult mining conditions in central appalachia high cost position and somewhat aggressive financial policy still the company is the largest producer of high quality low sulfur coal in central appalachia with an extensive reserve base and industry conditions are favorable
1278646 despite masseys substantial production of premium priced metallurgical coal and a strong current pricing environment for steam coal the companys geographic concentration in central appalachia exposes it to the regions difficult operating situation which includes increasing environmental costs a lengthy and difficult permitting process onerous safety regulations and narrowing coal seams
1278647 in addition the limited availability of experienced underground coal miners has historically constrained masseys attempts to expand production at its underground mining operations these factors in addition to increased raw material costs have meaningfully contributed to the substantial rise in cash operating costs over the past couple of years
1278648 we remain concerned about ongoing cost pressures and the companys ability to increase its productivity
1278649 we expect the company to finance its capital expenditure plans through generated cash flow from operations or existing liquidity sources as a result we expect debt to remain at around current levels

1278653 global demand for commodities is coming down so its not surprising that there will be a cyclical correction from what were very high levels driven by the four years of robust back to back world gdp gross domestic product growth
1278654 for those people who dont have any exposure this would be a good entry point

1278730 doris lessing once declared that fiction makes a better job of the truth than straightforward reminiscence and while that might well be true of her celebrated and semi autobiographical martha quest novels its an observation that doesnt apply at all to her latest book alfred amp emily an intriguing work that is half fiction half memoir the sketchy insubstantial first half of the book imagines what her parents lives might have been like if world war i had never occurred the potent and harrowing second half recounts the real life story of her parents and the incalculable ways in which the war fractured their dreams and psyches and left them stranded in the bush in africa eking out a meager existence on a tiny farm in rhodesia

1278769 if we had waited our costs probably would have doubled or more so as well
1278770 we did what we could with what we had and i think we should be proud of that

1278776 we started with the thought of doing something actually on a trail and realized it might be more useful to do something in town that could be a demonstration

1278780 they looked at whats the least amount of space youd need for certain things but also whats the key to having a good sense of community at the end of the walk
1278781 our design is more flexible in terms of being comfortable for a crowd of 12 but also comfortable for two or three people
1278782 i think a lot of people would use it especially if its advertised and marketed properly
1278783 i had never been on the west coast of nova scotia and it was just like a different world over there theres no real human presence around those trails its got a lot of potential for ecotourism

1278806 the experience of women workers in bleustar manufacturing incorporated shows us the increasing vulnerability of women workers to gender violence and sexual harassment in the workplace as well as the toothlessness of existing sexual harassment laws
1278807 it was disgusting but we had no choice we risk losing our jobs
1278808 most women workers would run to the comfort rooms or hide under the tables when mr ong would arrive we repeatedly complained about this but the management would tell us to just wash it off ipaligo nalang daw namin

1278837 at stake here is the entire idea of using virtual worlds as a petri dish if fantasy gamers behave in ways that violate our most basic assumptions of economic normalcy then it makes no sense to use virtual worlds to study large scale economic behavior if conversely fantasy gamers seem to be normal economic agents then perhaps some of the behavior in virtual worlds does indeed generalize to the real world if so then we can consider using virtual worlds to conduct controlled experiments at the macro scale of society where our most pressing problems seem to live natural resource management intercultural mistrust information security disease

1278887 we have already harmonised our export control requirements with that of nsg
1278888 all we want is a clean and unconditional exemption from the nsg
1278889 nsg guidelines require comprehensive safeguards applicable only to npt countries and since india has both civil and military programmes we have a unique position therefore such comprehensive safeguards are not relevant to india hence clean exemption from that is what we are seeking
1278890 they should exempt india from the requirement of comprehensive safeguards and add no other conditions

1278916 i know that im endangering my life and am even liable to lose my father but i hope that hell understand this and that god will give him and my family the patience and willingness to open their eyes to jesus and to christianity maybe one day ill be able to return to palestine and to ramallah together with jesus in the kingdom of god
1278917 as a child i grew up in a very religious family on the principle of hatred of israelis the first time i encountered them was at about the age of 10 when soldiers entered our home and arrested my father until then i had never been separated from him we didnt know anything about the circumstances of his arrest his membership in hamas was a secret matter and we certainly didnt think he was one of its founders i didnt understand anything about politics or religion i only knew that the israeli army had arrested my father repeatedly and for me he was everything a good loving man who would do anything for me he took care of us bought us gifts gave of himself whereas the soldiers entered our house and took him away from me in high school i studied sharia islamic law in 1996 when i was only 18 i was arrested by the israel defense forces because i was the head of the islamic society in my high school its a kind of youth movement of the organization and my process of awakening began
1278918 until then i knew hamas through my father who lived a very modest and loving life
1278919 nobody knows them and how they operate as well as i do
1278920 i feel that christianity has several aspects its not only a religion but a faith i now see god through jesus and can tell about him for days on end whereas the muslims wont be able to say anything about god i consider islam a big lie the people who supposedly represent the religion admired mohammed more than god killed innocent people in the name of islam beat their wives and dont have any idea what god is i have no doubt that theyll go to hell i have a message for them there is only one way to paradise the way of jesus who sacrificed himself on the cross for all of us
1278921 only those christians with whom i met and spent time knew about my decision for years i helped my father the hamas leader and he didnt know that i had converted only that i had christian friends
1278922 i respect israel and admire it as a country im opposed to a policy of killing civilians or using them as a means to an end and i understand that israel has a right to defend itself the palestinians if they dont have an enemy to fight will fight each other in about 20 years from now youll remember what im telling you the conflict will be among various groups within hamas theyre already beginning to quarrel over control of the money
1278923 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas islam as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews they believe that tradition says that the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and that therefore they must continue to fight them to the death they have to take revenge against anyone who did not agree to accept the prophet mohammed like the jews who are seen in the koran as monkeys and the sons of pigs they speak in terms of historical rights that were taken from them in the view of hamas peace with israel contradicts sharia and the koran and the jews have no right to remain in palestine
1278924 more than that an entire society sanctifies death and the suicide terrorists in palestinian culture a suicide terrorist becomes a hero a martyr sheikhs tell their students about the heroism of the shaheeds and that causes the young people to imitate the suicide bombers in order to achieve glory ill give you an example i once met a young man named dia tawil he was a quiet boy an outstanding student not a muslim extremist and not radical in his ideas against the israelis i never heard extreme statements from him he didnt even come from a religious family his father was a communist and his sister was a journalist who didnt wear a head covering but bilal barghouti one of the heads of the military arm of hamas in the west bank didnt need more than a few months to convince him to become a suicide terrorist
1278925 do you know that hamas was the first to use the weapon of suicide bombers against civilian targets
1278926 they are blind and ignorant its true there are good and bad people everywhere but hamas supporters dont understand that they are led by a wicked and cruel group that brainwashes the children and gets them to believe that if they carry out a suicide attack theyll get to paradise but no suicide bomber will find himself there and no virgins are waiting for them after they have carried out an attack they have to understand that islam was created by people and not by god
1278927 many people will hate me for this interview but im telling them that i love all of them even those who hate me i invite all the people including the terrorists among them to open their hearts and believe now im trying to establish an international organization for young people that will teach about christianity love and peace in the territories too i would like to teach the young people how to love and forgive because thats the only way the two nations can overcome the mistakes of the past and live in peace

1278939 there are two problems in relation to windfall taxes one in principle and one in practicality
1278940 the principle of providing certainty and stability certainly if you take our energy companies when i want them to be investing in new power stations is very important
1278941 and in relation to practicality if you look at the oil companies a lot of them make a lot of their money outside the uk and pay taxes in those countries where they carry out those operations
1278942 my main focus at the moment is working with energy companies to see how we can help people meet the difficult higher bills theyre facing
1278943 northern rock along with every other bank across the world is facing a very difficult time

1278987 about two years ago we passed a resolution to the effect that if there was going to be a third summer games in australia brisbane would be the candidate
1278988 it would be very difficult to win a bid but its not an impossible task
1278989 with such prestigious large cities bidding for the games constantly it would be a difficult so building venues in a flurry now might not be a wise idea
1278990 all i know is that this 2008 team we push each other
1278991 we all want that hardware all we think about is gold medals thats what we dream about the way i see it we should bring a pile home
1278992 i expect them to win at least three gold medals at these games
1278993 they are better now they are coming here as world champions these guys are motivated and they will do really well
1278994 one of the reasons i took them to colorado springs is because last time we had a great team some of the best boxers in the world but every time they went home they boxed in a style that had nothing to do with the olympics
1278995 these kinds of things happen in other parts of the world too and of course it will naturally have a psychological effect on tourists
1278996 but i think this is an individual incident at the same time there has been no fundamental change to the fact that we are basically a safe travel destination
1278997 i believe that through stepping up our work we can get the message across once again that china is safe and good value
1278998 we must release news in a timely way to ensure people know the real situation
1278999 we have made a brand new publicity film and we will increase work in this regard to put across the image that china is a safe destination

1279025 i believe that the sixaxis controller offers game designers and developers far more opportunity for future innovation than rumble ever did now rumble i think was the last generation feature its not the next generation feature
1279026 we have made a technical change to the machine which moves us from being a hardware embedded backwards compatibility solution to one which is a combination of hardware and software
1279027 i think the consumers that get their hands on a playstation 3 clearly see the value and not only want to buy one for 599 in some instances theyre willing to pay ridiculous prices on ebay
1279028 encourage buyers of the entry level playstation 3 to purchase more games designed specifically for the new system
1279029 has been the result of extensive research into the entertainment needs and preferences of the next generation ps3 owners

1279068 were still looking but imran has done a great job for us so far
1279069 he played a key role again at gloucester but its a bit unfair to call him our overseas player although hes come in and done a great job

1279071 this is kind of what they were saying earlier with what happened with hurricane alicia

1279084 theres always a gray area about what caused what first

1279110 i can confirm that the portuguese police put it to gerry as a fact that madeleines dna had been found in the apartment and the vehicle when it is now clear that that was not the case and that the initial fss report had said the findings were inconclusive
1279111 you have to ask what the police were trying to achieve by over presenting evidence that they did not have and clearly could not claim to have
1279112 kate and gerrys lawyers are continuing to examine all of the information in minute detail and where anything that is relevant to finding madeleine needs to be done it will be

1279128 we invited all the outfielders who played a certain number of games he definitely was invited we would love for him to come he was definitely a big part of this organization
1279129 were still getting response we dont have a final list
1279130 we dont know if hes going to come or not we always send letters and make follow up phone calls he was treated like everyone else
1279131 thats what well decide if we need to give him a break skip a start or shut him down
1279132 if we need to do that we will just like we did with timmy lincecum during the season a guy has two or three starts when he doesnt have his best stuff usually you work your way out of it were confident he will

1279147 i went over to the dingle this morning to go for a swim with my young son
1279148 the lifeguards told me the beach was closed for high bacteria counts
1279149 its a little ridiculous with the mayor jumping in and then the next day the beach is closed because of bacteria and stuff
1279150 if i wasnt at the beach there and i just hopped in off the rocks at point pleasant park thered be nobody telling me not to go in
1279151 its screened but not to the point of what were doing with the harbour solutions
1279152 there is a sewage outfall down near the port of halifax
1279153 it was just shut down as a precautionary measure and i think thats a good thing
1279154 as you recall two weeks ago it also rained hard and the bacteria counts were back down very very quickly
1279155 please note that due to high rain activity we are closing temporarily the dingle and black rock beach for swimming
1279156 we need to make sure that information is up to date
1279157 coming from here and training from here just proves that anyone can do it you can be from east jeddore oyster pond and go to the olympic games

1279160 ive kept a positive mental outlook all the time ive just never questioned my ability and my strengths
1279161 i think that this time around we are more confident as a team and we have a definite goal of reaching the team finals
1279162 if we can put that race out there and have the race of our lives we can achieve our main goal and hopefully the race of our lives will mean a medal at the other end
1279163 i want to make the medal race which is top 10 i want to be in medal contention going into that race and give it my best shot
1279164 our goal is to walk away saying we did the best we could and were happy we put our best performance forward
1279165 im just thinking about what i can do every day to be at my best in china
1279166 im just excited to be among the best in the world and to race my best
1279167 theres always going to be controversy and the press is always going to lock onto that controversy but i think the message of the olympics is about the success and the work that the athletes have put in and about the games themselves
1279168 i know there are issues going on but this is a world event where we all come together and compete against each other thats how im looking at it dont penalize the athletes
1279169 im just going over with the best attitude possible if its going to affect anybody its not going to affect me im just going to push through it
1279170 i feel pretty comfortable in the country and theyre very helpful and friendly
1279171 i think well be fine and i think theyll put on a pretty good show

1279184 with respect to the bail hearing its still subject to interpretation
1279185 its sure that this new provision is intended to reduce street crime
1279186 the first thing we need is a national strategy to reduce violent crime
1279187 limit its main response to violence to reacting to it after it has happened
1279188 without the long term vision there will be other dangerous people to step into the shoes of the people who are detained
1279189 the luck of participating in an olympics held in our motherland is a once in a century opportunity and a dream that our predecessors have fought to fulfill for 100 years
1279190 this is a historical chance for us we are burdened with a glorious mission

1279203 el objetivo de conseguir una medalla es muy importante a t tulo general pero tambi n a nivel individual
1279204 para nosotros es normal y tampoco nos sorprende somos de los que m s controles tenemos que pasar y lo nico que nos ha fastidiado un poco es que con el control y la rueda de prensa se nos ha modificado el planning del d a

1279207 es cierto que no es una carrera para sprinters pero tampoco hay muchos sprinters en estos juegos mi caso es diferente porque me defiendo en al media monta a y no es una carrera de tres semanas sino de un d a espero defenderme lo mejor posible y llegar hasta el final
1279208 es una carrera especial porque somos cinco corredores siempre te motiva porque es una vez cada cuatro a os y con la edad que tenemos la mayor a de nosotros ser la ltima vez que podamos estar en unos juegos es una carrera joven en los juegos ol mpicos y ganar siempre es importante pero creo que cuenta un poco m s la medalla a nivel de equipo que a nivel individual

1279222 green carbon the role of natural forests in carbon storage
1279223 protecting natural forests serves two purposes it maintains a large carbon sink and stops the release of the forests stored carbon
1279224 the majority of biomass carbon in natural forests resides in the woody biomass of large old trees commercial logging changes the age structure of forests so that the average age of trees is much younger
1279225 the carbon stock of forests subject to commercial logging and of monoculture plantations in particular will therefore always be significantly less on average than the carbon stock of natural undisturbed forests

1279231 daar ben ik het echt mee eens mijn vader was en blijft gewoon de koning van het volkslied dat klinkt misschien een beetje raar om over je vader te zeggen maar het is gewoon waar
1279232 hij was volkszanger nummer n en dat blijft ie ook
1279233 het is heel bijzonder dat je weet dat iemand dood is maar dat hij eigenlijk nog niet dood is dat muziek eigenlijk grenzeloos is of je nu dood bent of niet dood bent het leeft voort
1279234 hij was de aller aller allerbeste zanger die we ooit gehad hebben de beste volkszanger die er ooit is geweest
1279235 van welke muziek je ook houdt hazes kon en kan altijd en dat is goed nederland is meestal niet zo trots op zijn helden en het is misschien wel goed dat we dat nu een keer wel zijn
1279236 het hoort bij het leven het is een heel levenswerk wat hij neergezet heeft er zit altijd wel een liedje bij dat je aanspreekt en dat blijft hangen
1279237 iedereen die we benaderden om mee te doen met het album reageerde meteen met natuurlijk doe ik mee ik vind het een hele eer andr wordt nog een heel warm hart toegedragen
1279238 ik kon in het begin heel slecht naar andr zijn teksten luisteren naar zijn liedjes ik was iedere keer aan het huilen
1279239 maar toen zei kleine andr tegen mij mama dat moet je niet doen want het is juist heel mooi het zijn toch een soort boodschappen van papa dus haal er maar je kracht uit en toen dacht ik een ventje van 13 die dat tegen zijn moeder zegt dus dat doe ik nu

1279295 the new sepa payment instrument will be used primarily for cross border payments and will take the place of the standard eu credit transfer however it is only likely to be used extensively for domestic payments once banks provide their customers with assistance in automatically converting bank codes and account numbers to iban bic private and commercial banks in particular have this obligation
1279296 however it is advisable to address this question and to plan and migrate the it systems early on so that banks and their customers can benefit as soon as possible from the additional security offered by sepa
1279297 for a medium sized bank the cost of switching over to sepa will be at least six figures

1279303 while miss bimbo unlike gta is meant for kids its non violent and contains no pornography or overtly offensive language its distasteful and hard to agree with but we can no more take issue with the game itself than we can blame the interesting social microcosm of bully for well bullying like gta miss bimbo is somewhat of a satire of these archetypes and that can rob them of their venom in fact its a safe way for girls to explore ideas about social pressures what they do from there is a parental responsibility primarily and an issue for our culture at large

1279324 this is what the minister has to show after three full years and a 40 billion spend three inpatient beds a year
1279325 the governments commitment to increase total acute bed capacity was virtually complete
1279326 in fact by that time the total number of inpatient beds had fallen by 42 beds during the first full year of the ministers tenure between 2005 and 2007 the net gain in inpatient beds amounted to just 10 this occurred over a period when health spending increased from 11 9 billion in 2005 to 15 billion in 2007
1279327 this would be risible if it wasnt for the thousands of patients tragically affected by the ministers ineptitude in health
1279328 the 21 000 patients still on waiting lists for more than three months need look no further than the minister who delivers nothing beyond soundbites
1279329 40 billion and three years on the ministers record in health is little more than a sick joke

1279342 toen ik haar voor het eerst hoorde zingen dacht ik al meteen jij bent exact je vader qua zingen en qua doen en laten ze heeft die prachtige trilling in haar stem die andr ook had als haar stem straks wat meer is ontwikkeld en roxeanne iets meer durf krijgt zie ik een samenwerking wel zitten

1279362 alles wat ik nu als zanger ben komt door andr hazes
1279363 nadat dit jaar mijn manager wout van doleweerd een goede vriend van hazes overleed voelde ik dat ik iets moest doen toen heb ik rachel gebeld het was eerst de bedoeling dat alleen andr mee zou zingen in ahoy maar toen bleek dat zijn zus ook goed kon zingen
1279364 als we niet onder de douche staan te zingen doen we wel een duet samen
1279365 ik heb het roxeanne en andr netjes gevraagd ze mochten zelf beslissen daar zijn ze oud genoeg voor maar zeiden direct ja op het verzoek van wolter
1279366 wolter is de enige met wie ik dit zou willen doen na de ceremonie in de arena twee jaar geleden sprak ik met wolter toen was het meteen grappen samen
1279367 mr trott claimed that mrs trott had slapped him across the face several times and threw a frozen lasagna at him that struck him at the top of his head
1279368 in my opinion it hurts very much and will cause welts its like throwing a block of ice and its very heavy
1279369 later during the investigation they discovered that mr trott had a violation of injunction he was also arrested
1279370 all of them said they didnt think it would come to their arrest
1279371 the vehicles purchased by the plaintiff and the other class members were not as unique or rare as the defendants had stated them to be
1279372 their value from scarcity and as collectors items were and are dramatically less than the buyers had been led to believe their value would be
1279373 while it is rather rash to make detailed prophecies it is i think fairly clear that in future a human body from the moment of conception will not be regarded merely as something which must be left to grow in accordance with natural forces with no human interference beyond what is required for the preservation of health the tendency of scientific technique is to cause everything to be regarded as not just a brute datum but raw material for the carrying out of some human purpose the child and even the embryo will come to be viewed more and more in this way as the mentality connected with scientific technique becomes more dominant in this as in all other forms of scientific power there are possibilities of good and possibilities of evil science alone will not decide which is to prevail
1279374 science when it has once acquired a firm hold upon social organization is hardly likely to stop short at those biological aspects of human life which have hitherto been left to the joint guidance of religion and instinct we may i think assume that both the quantity and the quality of the population will be carefully regulated by the state but that sexual intercourse apart from children will be regarded as a private matter so long as it is not allowed to interfere with work as regards quantity the state statisticians will determine as carefully as they can whether the population of the world at the moment is above or below the number which leads to the greatest material comfort per head they will also take account of all such changes of technique as can be foreseen no doubt the usual rule will be to aim at a stationary population but if some important invention such as artificial food should greatly cheapen the production of necessaries an increase of population might for a time be thought wise i shall however assume that in normal times the world government will decree a stationary population if we were right in supposing that the scientific society will have different social grades according to the kind of work to be performed we may assume also that it will have uses for human beings who are not of the highest grade of intelligence it is probable that there will be certain kinds of labour mainly performed by negroes and that manual workers in general will be bred for patience and muscle rather than for brains the governors and experts on the contrary will be bred chiefly for their intellectual powers and their strength of character assuming that both kinds of breeding are scientifically carried out there will come to be an increasing divergence between the two types making them in the end almost different species scientific breeding in any truly scientific form would at present encounter insuperable obstacles both from religion and from sentiment to carry it out scientifically it would be necessary as among domestic animals to employ only a small percentage of males for purposes of breeding it may be thought that religion and sentiment will always succeed in opposing an immovable veto to such a system i wish i could think so but i believe that sentiment is quite extraordinarily plastic and that the individualistic religion to which we have been accustomed is likely to be increasingly replaced by a religion of devotion to the state among russian communists this has already happened in any case what is demanded is scarcely as difficult a control of natural impulses as is involved in the celibacy of the catholic priesthood wherever remarkable achievements are possible and are at the same time such as to satisfy mens moral idealism the love of power is capable of swallowing up the instinctive life of the affections especially if an outlet is permitted to purely physical sexual impulses traditional religion which has been violently dispossessed in russia will suffer a setback everywhere if the russian experiment proves successful in any case its outlook is difficult to reconcile with that of industrialism and scientific technique traditional religion was based upon a sense of mans impotence in the face of natural forces whereas scientific technique induces a sense of the impotence of natural forces in the face of mans intelligence combined with this sense of power a certain degree of austerity in regard to the softer pleasures is quite natural one sees it already in many of those who are creating the mechanistic society of the future in america this austerity has taken the form of protestant piety in russia of devotion to communism i think therefore that there is hardly any limit to the departures from traditional sentiment which science may introduce into the question of reproduction if the simultaneous regulation of quantity and quality is taken seriously in the future we may expect that in each generation some 25 per cent of women and some 5 per cent of men will be selected to be the parents of the next generation while the remainder of the population will be sterilized which will in no way interfere with their sexual pleasures but will merely render these pleasures destitute of social importance the women who are selected for breeding will have to have eight or nine children each but will not be expected to perform any other work except the suckling of the children for a suitable number of months no obstacles will be placed upon their relations with sterile men or upon the relations of sterile men and women with each other but reproduction will be regarded as a matter which concerns the state and will not be left to the free choice of the persons concerned perhaps it will be found that artificial impregnation is more certain and less embarrassing since it will obviate the need of any personal contact between the father and mother of the prospective child sentiments of personal affection may still be connected with intercourse not intended to be fruitful while impregnation will be regarded in an entirely different manner more in the light of a surgical operation so that it will be thought not ladylike to have it performed in the natural manner the qualities for which parents will be chosen will differ greatly according to the status which it is hoped the child will occupy in the governing class a considerable degree of intelligence will be demanded of parents perfect health will of course be indispensable so long as gestation is allowed to persist to its natural period mothers will also have to be selected by their capacity for easy delivery and will therefore have to be free from an unduly narrow pelvis it is probable however that as time goes on the period of gestation will be shortened and that later months of foetal development will take place in an incubator this would also free mothers from the need of suckling their children and would thus make maternity a not very onerous matter the care of infants intended to belong to the governing class would seldom be left to the mothers mothers would be selected by their eugenic qualities and these would not necessarily be the qualities required in a nurse on the other hand the early months of pregnancy might be more burdensome than at present since the foetus would be subjected to various kinds of scientific treatment intended to affect beneficially not only its own characteristics but those of its possible descendants fathers would of course have nothing to do with their own children there would be in general only one father to every five mothers and it is quite likely that he would never have even seen the mothers of his children the sentiment of paternity would thus disappear completely probably in time the same thing would happen though to a slightly less degree in regard to mothers if birth were prematurely induced and the child separated from its mother at birth maternal sentiment would have little chance to develop
1279375 among the workers it is probable that less elaborate care would be taken since it is easier to breed for muscle than to breed for brains and it is not unlikely that women would be allowed to bring up their own children in the old fashioned natural manner there would not be among the workers the same need as among the governors for fanatical devotion to the state and there would not be therefore on the part of the government the same jealousy of the private affections among the governors one must suppose all private sentiments would be viewed with suspicion a man and woman who showed any ardent devotion to each other would be regarded as they are at present regarded by moralists when they are not married there would be professional nurses in cr ches and professional teachers in nursery schools but they would be considered to be failing in their duty if they felt any special affection for special children children who showed any special affection for a particular adult would be separated form that adult ideas of this kind are already widespread they will be found suggested for example in dr john b watsons book on education the tendency of the scientific manipulator is to regard all private affections as unfortunate freudians have shown us that they are the sources of complexes administrators realize that they stand in the way of a whole hearted devotion to business the church sanctioned certain kinds of love while condemning others but the modern ascetic is more thoroughgoing and condemns all kinds of love equally as mere folly and waste of time
1279376 what should we expect of the mental make up of people in such a world the manual workers may i think be fairly happy one may assume that the rulers will be successful in making the manual workers foolish and frivolous work will not be too severe and there will be endless amusements of a trivial sort owing to sterilization love affairs need not have awkward consequences so long as they are not between a man and woman who are both of them unsterilized in this way a life of easygoing and frivolous pleasure may be provided for the manual workers combined of course with a superstitious reverence for the governors instilled in childhood and prolonged by the propaganda to which adults will be exposed the psychology of the governors will be a more difficult matter they will be expected to display an arduous and hard working devotion to the ideal of the scientific state and to sacrifice to this ideal all the softer sentiments such as love of wife and children friendships between fellow workers whether of the same or of different sexes will tend to become ardent and will not infrequently overstep the limits which the public moralists will have fixed in such a case the authorities will separate the friends unless in doing so they will interrupt some important research or administrative undertaking when for some such public reason friends are not separated they will be admonished by means of governmental microphones the censors will listen in to their conversations and if these should at any time become tinged with sentiment disciplinary measures will be adopted all the deeper feelings will be frustrated with the sole exception of devotion to science and the state the governors will of course have their amusements for leisure hours i do not see how art or literature could flourish in such a world nor do i think that the emotions from which they spring and to which they appeal would meet with governmental approval but athletics of a strenuous kind will be encouraged among the young of the governing class and dangerous sports will be considered valuable as a training in those habits of mind and body by which authority over the manual workers will be maintained love making among the sterilized will be subjected to no restrictions either of law or of public opinion but it will be casual and temporary involving none of the deeper feelings and no serious affection persons suffering from unendurable boredom will be encouraged to ascend mount everest or fly over the south pole but the need for such distractions will be regarded as a sign of mental or physical ill health in such a world though there may be pleasure there will be no joy the result will be a type displaying the usual characteristics of vigorous ascetics they will be harsh and unbending tending towards cruelty in their ideals and their readiness to consider that the infliction of pain is necessary for he public good i do not imagine that pain will be much inflicted as punishment for sin since no sin will be recognized except insubordination and failure to carry out the purposes of the state it is more probable that the sadistic impulses which the asceticism will generate will find their outlet in scientific experiment the advancement of knowledge will be held to justify much torture of individuals by surgeons biochemists and experimental psychologist as time goes on the amount of added knowledge required to justify a given amount of pain will diminish and the number of governors attracted to the kinds of research necessitating cruel experiments will increase just as the sun worship of the aztecs demanded the painful death of thousands of human beings annually so the new scientific religion will demand its holocausts of sacred victims gradually the world will grow more dark and more terrible strange perversions of instinct will first lurk in the dark corners and then gradually overwhelm the men in high places sadistic pleasures will not suffer the moral condemnation that will be meted out to the softer joys since like the persecutions of the inquisition they will be found in harmony with the prevailing asceticism in the end such a system must break down either in an orgy of bloodshed or in the rediscovery of joy such at least is the only ray of hope to lighten the darkness of these visions of cassandra but perhaps in permitting this ray of hope we have allowed ourselves to yield to a foolish optimism perhaps by means of injections and drugs and chemicals the population could be induced to bear whatever its scientific masters may decide to be for its good new forms of drunkenness involving no subsequent headache may be discovered and new forms of intoxication may be invented so delicious that for their sakes these are possibilities in a world governed by knowledge without love and power without delight the man drunk with power is destitute of wisdom and so long as he rules the world the world will be a place devoid of beauty and of joy
1279377 take again such a matter as housing in england individualism leads most families to prefer a small house of their own rather than an apartment in a large house the result is that the suburbs of london are spread out through mile after mile of dreariness to the immense detriment of the women and children each housewife cooks an abominable dinner at great expenditure of labour for an infuriated husband the children when they come home from school or while they are too young to go to school find themselves cooped up in small stuffy premises where either they are a nuisance to their parents or their parents are a nuisance to them in a more sensible community each family would occupy a part of an immense building with a courtyard in the middle there would be no individual cooking but only communal meals children as soon as they were no longer at the breast would spend their day in large airy halls under the care of women possessing the knowledge the training and the temperament required for making young children happy the wives who at present drudge all day doing wasteful work badly would be set free to earn their living outside the home the benefit of such a system to the mothers and still more to the children would be incalculable at the rachel macmillan nursery school it was found that about 90 per cent of the children had rickets when they first came and almost all were cured at the end of the first year in the school in the ordinary home the necessary modicum of light and air and good food cannot be provided whereas all these things can be provided quite cheaply if they are provided for many children at once the freedom to cause ones children to grow up stunted and crippled on the ground that one is too fond of them to part with them is a freedom which is certainly not in the public interest

1279389 we applied with the games organisers to order an extra long bed after the good luck beijing test events in april
1279390 back then all the clinical beds here were just 2 1 metres long and were very uncomfortable for the patients
1279391 of course we hope no one gets injured and all the athletes play well at the games

1279395 herr brand zwei monate vorbereitung sind jetzt fast vorbei olympia steht vor der t r wie viel kraft hat das ganze unternehmen schon gekostet
1279396 das war schon eine sehr intensive zeit f r alle beteiligten f r die spieler rein k rperlich wo sie an die grenzen gehen und dann irgendwo aber auch mit dem kopf dabei sein m ssen aber auch f r mich vorbereitung und ver nderung des programms auftritte in den medien das sind schon gef llte tage wir waren zweimal zwei tage und einmal drei tage zuhause aber das k nnen keine urlaubtage sein da habe ich von morgens bis abends am schreibtisch gesessen
1279397 was erwarten sie von den ersten olympischen spielen in china
1279398 es werden sicher andere spiele als bisher gewohnt ich denke viele dinge ber die im vorfeld diskutiert worden ist werden sich schon irgendwo erledigt haben wir m ssen auch nicht als mannschaft dar ber sprechen jeder hat ja das recht sich zu u ern ich denke viele haben schon ihre meinung aber vor allen dingen sehen sie es so dass wir uns auf den sportlichen bereich konzentrieren das kann nicht unsere aufgabe sein dinge zu erledigen die die politik nicht schafft
1279399 und was erwarten sie f r das olympische handball turnier darf man von einem besseren niveau als bei em und wm ausgehen da mehr zeit zur vorbereitung war
1279400 es sind ja doch einige nationen die nicht diese erholung hatten die qualifikationen spielen mussten deswegen mache ich mir da keine gedanken im nachhinhein kann man sich mal gedanken machen auf welchem niveau das turnier stattgefunden hat jetzt geht es nur um die eigene vorbereitung
1279401 was k nnen die spiele f r die entwicklung ihrer spieler bringen
1279402 so ein turnier bringt die jungen spieler immer weiter man sammelt erfahrungen die man sonst nicht sammeln kann weil man sich international bewegt weil es eben die olympische spiele in einem besonderen ambiente sind das sind au ergew hnliche erfahrungen
1279403 die er ffnungsfeier werden sie der mannschaft aber nicht g nnen
1279404 das habe ich entschieden dass wir das nicht machen das ist nicht zu verantworten zwei tage vor dem ersten spiel wenn man wei dass man stundenlang irgendwo stehen muss da w rde ich ewig ein schlechtes gewissen haben wenn wir das erste spiel verlieren w rden nat rlich m chte jede mannschaft gerne einmarschieren was ich auch verstehen kann ich habe auch schon mal mit tr nen in den augen auf der trib ne gesessen und beim einmarsch zugeguckt ich kann das sehr gut nachvollziehen aber unsere aufgabe ist es m glichst gut abzuschneiden
1279405 dabei soll ihnen auch wieder christian schwarzer helfen waren sie von dem gro en trubel um seine nominierung berrascht
1279406 ich hatte mit den reaktionen gerechnet und ich bin zu 100 prozent berzeugt und habe mir das von fachkollegen best tigen lassen dass christian schwarzer der st rkste deutsche kreisl ufer ist also kann ich guten gewissens dahinterstehen
1279407 christian schwarzer ist auch noch einer jener spieler aus der sogenannten goldenen generation die 2004 mit silber abgetreten ist was unterscheidet die mannschaft von heute von der damals
1279408 das war die alte generation und ist relativ schwer zu vergleichen die mannschaft damals hatte viele r ckschl ge wegstecken m ssen bevor sie nach athen kam diese hier ist relativ schnell nach oben gekommen man nehme nur den wm titel
1279409 man macht sich gedanken ber die gesamte entwicklung wie schnell und wie steil gehts nach oben das sind ja alles dinge die man nur ungef hr wei wie es sich dann tats chlich darstellt zu welchem zeitpunkt das passiert das kann man nie genau sagen

1279431 and these genital warts i got from a ravishing fellow from wales
1279432 prostitution whether its high end or any other form is really just an expression of mens beliefs that women are disposable sexual objects or mens property

1279434 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

1279463 this specification might have certain additional requirements on character encodings image formats audio formats and video formats in the respective sections
1279464 it would be helpful for interoperability if all browsers could support the same codecs however there are no known codecs that satisfy all the current players we need a codec that is known to not require per unit or per distributor licensing that is compatible with the open source development model that is of sufficient quality as to be usable and that is not an additional submarine patent risk for large companies
1279465 if you dont revert you will be giving us independent authors the shaft and we will remember it forever
1279466 there are unimplemented bits bugs etc that need to be sorted out but its a start towards using a common codec across all platforms and will improve as we get towards the 3 1 release

1279492 were no longer based on the existence of nation states we must reinvent ourselves

1279503 he said hed do something about the price of groceries the report doesnt do anything about it at all
1279504 giving shoppers a pair of binoculars and telling them to look at the prices of groceries is not going to do anything to bring it down
1279505 evidence provided to the inquiry does not support the proposition that retail prices have risen while farm gate prices have stagnated or declined
1279506 while there may be some instances where this has occurred generally movements in farm gate pricing are determined by supply and demand in international national and local markets
1279507 changes in the wholesale prices that coles woolworths and metcash pay suppliers are reflected in movements in shelf prices over time
1279508 this has had a dynamic impact on the grocery sector and brought about competitive responses from coles and woolworths on many products
1279509 competition between retailers is however sufficient to ensure that coles and woolworths cannot simply retain all of the benefits of the lower wholesale prices they extract at least some of the benefits flow to consumers in the form of lower retail prices
1279510 woolworths is already working towards this with a trial in its baulkham hills store leading to a national rollout soon
1279511 mr rudd and mr swan between them over eight months have destroyed business and consumer confidence in the australian economy

1279575 the move is designed to attract greater foreign investment and is part of the countrys sweeping economic liberalization program iran will no longer make a distinction between domestic and foreign firms that wish to purchase state run companies as long as the combined foreign ownership in any particular industry does not exceed 35 as an example a foreign firm may purchase an iranian steel company but it would not be allowed to buy every business enterprise in irans steel industry among the new incentive measures announced foreign firms may also transfer their annual profit from their iranian company out of the country in any currency they wish

1279632 four days after this great conversation in which he was enthusiastic and funny i get this email that was almost like a form letter
1279633 and it reads thank you for offering to have me in the movie but i am going to have to decline to participate i wish you and the rhoads family the best of luck it was so impersonal i really dont know what made him change his mind
1279634 this documentary is about randy not about anyone else or any past grievances
1279635 so if you really consider yourself a friend come in and do it for him
1279636 when dakota pictures director peter margolis called me to be involved in the proposed randy rhoads documentary i was hesitant to say the least
1279637 be totally about randy and not about others trying promote a book or new album and their own personal agendas
1279638 i told him that i have arguably the most accurate and complete memory from those years and would be willing to provide him with any and all of the massive amount of archival material in my possession which is extensive
1279639 after being advised to do some careful investigation on my part a few days later i realized that this film and some of its participants indeed had their own overriding priorities and randy would not be represented as accurately or in many ways in a truthful manner then and only then did i decide to bow out
1279640 as anyone who really knows me will tell you i adored randy rhoads
1279641 when dakota pictures director peter margolis called me to be involved in the proposed randy rhoads documentary i was hesitant to say the least

1279643 after being advised to do some careful investigation on my part a few days later i realized that this film and some of its participants indeed had their own overriding priorities and randy would not be represented as accurately or in many ways in a truthful manner
1279644 in all the five years that i played with randy we never once had an argument and spent many hours playing around in the hollywood area
1279645 below please find the original letter that i sent peter margolis via e mail
1279646 please accept this e mail as my formal notice to decline your kind offer to participate in your planned film project randy rhoads documentary that you previously approached me about
1279647 it is my continued devotion and affection for the memory of randy rhoads and our time together that dictates that i keep those memories and feelings private so that they are not misconstrued as an attempt to monopolize on either randys life or his untimely passing
1279648 i will continue to hold randys memory dear and private as always i wish you much success in this worthwhile endeavor do randys memory family and legacy proud
1279649 while i do wish them success with the film my protective feelings for the memory of randy will not allow me to be a part in this in any manner
1279650 with no disrespect intended to all involved wouldnt it be a fitting tribute to the memory and greatness that still is randy rhoads for the film makers and everyone involved to decree that all the proceeds and profits from this film after legitimate non inflated artists or production cost be designated as a gift to a charity chosen by the rhoads family or perhaps that profits from the film be contributed to a randy rhoads music scholarship what a fitting and selfless tribute that would truly be i guess i can dream cant i

1279713 to be honest i still dont know what happened all i ever heard from the coaches was shoot the puck work hard it will all work out but
1279714 i mean you dont want people to think you lost it and cant play that gives you some motivation probably

1279719 i put down phys ed teacher because thats what my dad did i wanted to get her off my back
1279720 i think it was grade 6 when i said to him michael maybe you should put down something else you know it might not happen
1279721 we knew he was really good and you always hope for the best for your child but we figured here in bonavista everything is so small what chance do you have realistically
1279722 every time ive had him hes had a good year
1279723 when he came to hull he had a lot to learn eh because in bonavista he really hadnt played much he had a lot to learn
1279724 i had to bench him for the third period in shawinigan
1279725 like i say he had to learn thats all he was just a kid after two periods he hadnt broken a sweat he wasnt lazy hes never been lazy he just had to get the message
1279726 hey players dont have to like you they just have to understand
1279727 did i have a bad game apparently i try to block it all out
1279728 what i like about claude is that he knows how to get every inch out of every player
1279729 its what he does well even in junior we didnt have the most talented team but we beat teams just by working hard
1279730 and ill admit i was leaning to boston because every time hes played for claude hes done well hull then hamilton then montreal
1279731 at one point while he was making up his mind michael said ok i get it you love claude you love claude julien
1279732 i think he made a good choice for us the time zones better too its much easier for us to watch games in the east
1279733 you grow up here you see icebergs whales all the time and its like you take it all for granted

1279737 something we know to be true in the world and in literature is that the imagination has difficulty living in the daily world and miraculously there is an artist who demonstrated that for a period of time the imagination could live in at least a version of the daily world and that was joseph cornell at the risk of terrible pretension i think that for a brief moment there was joseph cornell living on utopia parkway in a house surrounded by hedges and for a very few people they understood that this was like the cave of ali baba that you could enter within a working class neighborhood of queens a completely haunted realm and that you would not have to bottle or un bottle the genie who was in charge of it and that he the genie could sometimes put on clothes and perhaps visit new york city but i guarantee you for him it was a place of spires and minarets and yet no one destroyed him and there because of the power of the work a protection around him in the same way that certain figures take on metaphysical pretensions and generate a kind of holiness wherever they go i think cornell had a supernatural aura that allowed people for that time they encountered him to not call him or it precious but rather mysterious astonishing mystifying and beautiful and thats what i mean that the imagination was able to enter the world briefly
1279738 cornell who could neither paint draw sculpt nor hold a movie camera is famous above all for his small glass fronted shadow boxes with their puzzling assemblages of found objects and less so for his collages and short films in addition to hundreds of works of art he left behind a vast archive of files memorabilia and source material on his various projects all stored now at the smithsonian which the authors of recent studies have gone over for clues as deborah solomon writes in her recent biography it is often said of artists that they live in fear of being misunderstood cornell by contrast lived in fear of being understood like edgar allan poe and emily dickinson before him cornell was a lover of secrets and mysteries he himself described his boxes as being like forgotten games of a childhood rich in ambiguities the art world being what it is today cornells independence of mind appears worthy of emulation
1279739 the dog barking at the moon is the only poet
1279740 l gypte de mlle cl o de m rode cours l mentaire dhistoire naturelle
1279741 throughout his life cornell was fascinated by women with mystique
1279742 and this box is an homage not only to one but two of those women
1279743 part of cornells genius lay in being able to project himself into the experience of something else completely different
1279744 like if he watches a sparrow pecking among the gravel outside his window he becomes that sparrow pecking at the gravel outside the window and in spite of the fact that he uses readymade birds you also feel theyre set into motion in some way which to me is a little bit similar its as though cornell is identifying with the habitat of these birds the birds are perching on twigs twittering balancing perhaps diving for food this is only one aspect of it because you have so many other complicating elements there like the columns of figures and the numbers are these related to games perhaps even shooting targets and so suddenly as so often happens when youre looking at a cornell box having followed one direction you suddenly come back and find that theres something actually a little bit more sinister underlying it
1279745 its almost like three dimensional literature the story of paul and virginia is based on that of a french author from the late 18th century that became wildly popular during the victorian era all around the world so that cornell in his various perambulations through libraries came across english versions of the story and his grandfather actually owned one of the many romantic lithographs that interpreted events in the story line and cornell remembered that as well the story of paul and virginia has to do with two star crossed lovers they were born on an island in the indian ocean and were destined to marry until virginia was taken off to europe she tried desperately to return and as she did her ship sank in sight of her lover paul he tried to get to her desperately and she died in his arms so in many respects this is actually something of a casket for both paul and virginia because the box is covered with illustrations from one of the books paul and virginia and you see different snippets from their happy life on the island as well as images that suggest the hard things that happened to them that mysterious dark blue chamber at the top of box actually has when youre able to peer into it images of fish which could suggest the watery grave that virginia actually went to dead center at the bottom theres a little robins nest with robins egg blue eggs and while they were children paul and virginia used to gather nests as tokens of affection for one another they also gathered widows flowers which have the color blue and the box is dominated by the color blue and so you begin to have this whole sense that hes trying to capture both the early and the later events in paul and virginias life as sort of a cabinet in honor of the two young lovers
1279746 from the 1930s to the 1950s cornell converted numerous old wood boxes once used to store and carry writing accessories jewelry medicines and toiletries into works that he often described as museums and pharmacies
1279747 usually they feature vials or bottles filled with found objects especially shells sands and colored liquids feathers snippets of text and illustrations beads marbles and mineral and wood samples the selection of materials is inherently poetic yet the bottled orderly compendia suggest that a scientist magician or collector has been at work chests cabinets and museums fulfill mans need to preserve classify and display specimens documents mementos and treasures the tradition of the cabinet of curiosities and the wunderkammer room of wonders have played illustrious roles in the evolution of museums and cornell tapped into these traditions in creating his own museums he also used old chests and cabinets some with doors shelves and handles to create miniature reliquaries dedicated to historical figures and fictional characters
1279748 as the blue sand cascades down from the reservoir at the top of the box
1279749 little flecks of white paint skitter across the blue like comets or shooting stars in the night sky these heavenly bodies have dislodged from the sides of the box through an aging process that cornell intentionally created by applying repeated layers of paint each baked in his kitchen oven to vintage the boxes his sand fountains are miniature theaters of time as the sand falls here it overflows the cordial glass and with the undulating movement of a tide eventually covers the small starfish at the bottom of the box suggesting both a creature in the deep blue sea and a star in the night sky
1279750 cornells genius and originality disarm critics and make them affectionate and inspired
1279751 one can deduce and conclude that every object has two aspects one current which we see nearly always and which is seen by men in general and the other which is spectral and metaphysical and seen only by rare individuals in moments of clairvoyance
1279752 transforms the user into alice in wonderland it gives the opportunity to explore cornells universe through more than 250 of his boxes and collages
1279753 now here you see it takes all the running you can do to keep in the same place
1279754 this haunting image of bronzinos portrait of bia di cosimo de medici in cornells hands has become dream and homage and elegy
1279755 cornell shrouded his princess in mystery by placing her in the center of a complex cabinet and behind three plates of glass one tinted blue the color of the night from which she is constantly emerging somehow it evokes memory the princess is flanked by quartered images of herself in which one or two sections are always obscured by a darker blue as if in a flickering and incomplete image on film she seems simultaneously in motion and forever still the notion exists that part of her lost to time and irretrievable is echoed by her hidden image which is reflected from the back of the blue cube onto a mirror in the lower portion of the box portrayed at a young and tender age the princess nevertheless displays the formal trappings and gravity of royalty the fact that she died very young would not have been lost on cornell who characteristically in his desire to protect and idealize children enshrined her spirit in this hauntingly beautiful work
1279756 the two emilies referred to in the title refers to emily dickinsons friend whom cornell learned she had a very close and meaningful relationship with
1279757 and one could well imagine in a white washed winter landscape in amherst massachusetts emily dickinsons excitement upon the pending arrival of her visiting friend perhaps drawn by horse drawn sleigh
1279758 once cornell discovered the international revival of the romantic ballet in the late 1930s
1279759 he spent the next thirty years exploring his fascination with the queens of the dance he described his dance related boxes as souvenir cases or bouquets and often included the phrase homage to the romantic ballet or cited specific ballets in their titles many of the boxes refer to ballerinas such as the romantic eras prima ballerina marie taglioni or her modern counterparts tamara toumanova and ren e jeanmarie among them whose interpretive talents and grace contributed to the romantic ballets revival several works incorporate miniature reproductions of ballerinas portraits from cornells extensive collection of dance ephemera yet his use of delicate materials bits of ribbon and tulle costume beading dried flowers and butterfly wings is often enough to suggest that his dance related boxes are conceptual portraits of the ballerina as a timeless creative spirit and the embodiment of all too fleeting beauty reflecting his sensitivity to set design and narrative other examples present metaphorical versions of famous ballets such as swan lake or sleeping beauty the source of inspiration for his series of pink palaces
1279760 although cornell rarely committed explanations of his work to paper
1279761 the impact of seeing a pet stores display of tropical birds during the late 1930s moved him to describe in some detail the origins and approach for his
1279762 most often cornells three dimensional poems contain those things essential to movement in space
1279763 compasses watches earth sun and moon maps star charts or they evoke games which rely upon the mastery of projectiles and itineraries such as slot machines penny arcades and shooting galleries his aviaries with their mirrors peepholes and clock springs fit into this category because they promise to tell us something about migration as do his observatories and sand fountains some boxes reveal the workings of wind others divulge the time of the suns rising and setting and the exact length of days and nights another explains the phases of the moon yet another describes the elements which make up the cosmos and cornells star hotels are just that they offer rooms in space a glimpse of one interior gives a peep shows ideal view of a sky bristling with zodiacs all cornells boxes are time machines they take us into memorys deepest recesses to those sublime moments of infancy when the world still spelled enchantment

1279832 en na gesprekken met vriendin en collegas werd dit nogmaals bevestigd is het advies voor de komende weken

1279840 whats really changed in the past 10 years is the political landscape
1279841 which affects their comfort level and ability to access care
1279842 but reproductive health is not decided by the city outside the city limits its redneck hell
1279843 youre looking at services for poor black and increasingly latino populations you cant ignore racial politics in the south
1279844 our profile is really poor in how we do health care and what we do in education
1279845 for a state that prides itself on being the real powerhouse of the south a more progressive state of the south our policies and resources are not utilized in a way that reflects that the problem in these conservative states is some of the focus is on being the sex police weve not come together to say that every child should be planned for and wanted
1279846 reproductive health is in the back of the bus as a priority

1279863 everything jamy does looks natural although you know its a trick i feel the same about truly great flash work i know its achievable but i dont know how they did it
1279864 we have to come out strong tuesday we dont have a choice
1279865 you need to start from square one every year and continue to reach back and build a foundation
1279866 i would say our older players came back in very good condition id say 95 passed the test our younger players just like every younger player in america theyre finding out that theyre young and theres an adjustment there so even though theyve been acclimated a little bit theres still an adjustment
1279867 i dont get butterflies anymore but it brings back memories
1279868 ill call my position coach from south carolina i do it every year because it brings you back to where you started i think the first day of practice always does that
1279869 day 1 in practice i think everyone whos ever played college football remembers that first day
1279870 we just have to figure out which is the guy as we move into camp
1279871 we wont know that for probably 2 3 weeks as we find out who can handle all the situations
1279872 you know we see rodney as a starter hes a sixth starter
1279873 we have a young group and if we continue to develop them and add their playing time to our starters i see us having a chance to be really good right now and on down the road even if we keep the nucleus the way it is right now
1279874 we understand that players have strengths and weaknesses and were not going to harp on their weaknesses
1279875 were going to try to be a positive influence when were coaching them we are trying to coach from a positive standpoint rather than a negative standpoint
1279876 its a hall of fame quarterback getting back in our division
1279877 the record proves itself what else can you say about the guy hes a winner
1279878 i mean they got the same team they had last year
1279879 hes seen so much in this defense if were on our job and hes on his job chances are hes going come out probably a little more on top than us because hes a quarterback and hes seen every look you can give him
1279880 playing against the best always brings out the best in other players
1279881 coach dungy wouldnt speak to the defense often but when hed come in for that week hed speak to us and let us know that hey bretts going to throw three or four balls youve just got to catch them its just a great opportunity for a secondary to rise up and accept the challenge
1279882 i think hes playing probably as good as ive ever seen him play
1279883 the love the man has for this game i think is whats bringing him back
1279884 i had more of his baseball cards than anybody elses
1279885 when he was holding his press conference friday when he joined the white sox he was wearing his hat backwards i think hes the one who wanted to make every kid wear his hat backwards
1279886 i liked the way his swing looked and his defensive plays
1279887 the only thing i wanted to do like him was swing and hit home runs
1279888 i got it at a flea market its a baseball card with a little inscription and its matted nice i think it cost 20
1279889 i dont think hes hit a homer off me ill go with my strengths
1279890 that was the one everyone was trying to trade for it was a popular card because he was so good he was hitting home runs you just knew he was going to be good
1279891 he was a rookie and upper deck had just come out that might have been the first year for upper deck

1279894 probably the area that were most disappointed in is i didnt find out until i watched on the couch last night and that makes it very difficult in our situation it compromises our ability to actually help players with issues like this
1279895 as a young kid i dreamt of playing afl football and my dream has come true so ive just got one more dream that i need to fulfil before i move on
1279896 its been a challenging and rewarding journey for crawf thus far and were hoping that hes going to play a fair amount of footy for us this year and also in the years ahead if his body enables him to do that

1279901 when you have two of your key players looking at the president the coach and their own teammates in the eye and actually lying to them it really destroys the essence of the club
1279902 it was decided by the leadership group the executive that these two players actually dont deserve to wear the collingwood football club jumper and thats why theyre not playing for the rest of the season
1279903 they have explained why they lied and we understand the reasons and we dont accept or support it
1279904 i cant see why they are backing me i think people should start saving their money or put it somewhere else theres six or seven other blokes who are well ahead
1279905 its pretty similar his form compared to last year but i have to play a number of different roles than i did last year

1279909 ive been impressed with him i like him very much and im pleased weve got him here
1279910 hes a good kid and has the potential to become a very good player he was recommended to me and we got him here straight away because there is a big gulf at the club between senior players and young kids

1279914 what kind of church that you are actually try to find
1279915 try to read the acts of the apostles chapter 2 and 4 you will find what is church and that is the ideal church in my view
1279916 soon i am going to die and all people who follow me will leave me but jesus christ after he die his followers never left him even the population increased and were able to shake the world
1279917 how many persons who have been joined to my church both unbelievers who repent and believers who renew their faith
1279918 how many persons who have heard about the gospel from me this week
1279919 human salvation is more important rather that the number of people inside of the church
1279920 man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of god
1279921 bless are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled
1279922 why that we have to go to the church if we can only meet the disharmony and send our offering money there but never get something which makes us find god
1279923 teach us to number our day aright that we may gain a heart of wisdom
1279924 church does not implement its function as the salt of the world which is giving the cure of the pain because of sins
1279925 the inclination that is faced by todays church is the losing of the true love of the church the only thing that is loved by the church is the existence of the church itself church does not care to its members church does not care with gods reputation and church does not care to the society and world which surround it church only cares to its own development to be the biggest church and if it necessary the church will sacrifice the other
1279926 saya prihatin dengan kondisi tersebut mungkin itu juga yang menjadi penyebab mengapa
1279927 yang membahas tentang permasalahan di dalam gereja dan diantara orang percaya kadangkala saya merasa tidak berada diantara orang percaya tapi diantara orang orang farisi yang merasa diri rohani dan diselamatkan oleh allah tapi sebenarnya tidak ehmm tapi mungkin saya perlu bertanya kepada diri saya sendiri tentang hal ini saya takut jangan jangan saya juga salah satu dari orang farisi yang saya sebutkan tadi
1279928 berapa banyak ya orang orang baru yang bergabung dengan gerejaku baik mereka orang belum percaya yang kemudian bertobat maupun orang percaya yang memperbaharui iman mereka
1279929 berapa orang yang sudah mendengar berita injil dariku minggu ini
1279930 keselamatan manusia lebih penting daripada jumlah orang di dalam gereja
1279931 manusia hidup bukan dari roti saja tetapi dari setiap firman yang keluar dari mulut allah
1279932 berbahagialah orang yang lapar dan haus akan kebenaran karena mereka akan dipuaskan
1279933 gereja tidak lagi menyatakan fungsinya sebagai garam dunia yang memberikan pengobat dari rasa sakit karena dosa malah sebaliknya menjadi madu dunia yang makin mempermanis dosa dunia dengan kata lain gereja telah menjadi sama dengan dunia bahkan lebih buruk dan tidak lagi menunjukkan budaya tandingan yang membuatnya menjadi berbeda dengan dunia saya tidak tahu seberapa prihatin anda melihat kesaksian gereja yang lemah di tengah masyarakat
1279934 kecenderungan yang dihadapi gereja pada saat ini adalah kehilangan kasih yang sejati satu satunya hal yang dikasihi gereja pada saat ini adalah dirinya sendiri gereja tidak lagi peduli dengan jemaatnya gereja tidak lagi peduli dengan reputasi allah dan gereja tidak peduli lagi dengan masyarakat serta dunia disekitarnya gereja hanya peduli dengan bagaimana gerejanya semakin berkembang dan menjadi besar bila perlu mengorbankan yang lainnya

1279941 ours is a non chemical technology and it is competing in canada and other countries with a chemical that is added to the controlled atmosphere to keep apples firm hard and green
1279942 but in canada the chemical smartfresh has a huge chemical company behind it
1279943 it keeps apples hard and green which supermarkets love and yet the flavour has gone
1279944 our method allows the fruit to age naturally and on the plus side it also allows the fruits to develop their flavour
1279945 the smartfresh is a chemical which penetrates the apple and interacts in the cell of the apple to some reactions that are responsible for normal ripening and aging
