7880013 i want to ring fence london development agency money for sport and that means not just investing in facilities but also investing in the mentoring and the tuition that are so important for long term success
7880014 you can have the facilities but if you dont invest in the people to train and give people encouragement its not going to work sporting opportunity can be part of an early intervention strategy that tackles child poverty and under achievement
7880015 i hope a new generation of london children will be enthused inspired and get involved in sport in a way that theyre not now
7880016 no actual figure has been put on this but the lda will be working with the mayor to deliver his vision
7880017 the results in beijing have decisively lifted the curse of dashed expectations that so often hangs over british sport now we need to build on this for the future by getting more young people involved in sport
7880018 some will do it because they want to be the next christine ohuruogu others just because it is healthy and fun our reforms will secure more funding for grassroots sport which has to be the solid foundation on which future sporting success is built

7880021 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year declines in the present situation index both in term of business conditions and the labor market appear to be moderating the expectations index which posted a significant gain this month suggests better times may be ahead however overall readings are still quite low by historical standards and it is still too early to tell if the worst is behind us

7880028 we want to recognize our military personnel and remind their families that the program is on going they can give them a gift during the holiday season or anytime during the year
7880029 zipcar offers a wonderful way for bowdoin students faculty and staff to take cars off the road and reduce our carbon footprint
7880030 beginning with the class of 2013 first year students will no longer be able to have cars on campus and zipcar will provide an inexpensive and convenient alternative for them and for our upper class students faculty and staff thanks to zipcar over time i expect well see fewer students with cars and more one car families
7880031 this is just one more in a long list of initiatives that colby has undertaken to reduce our carbon footprint
7880032 the zipcars allow students with cars to leave them at home if they want and it adds a transportation option for those who dont have cars its an all around good idea
7880033 the partnership with zipcar will help us further our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint and create a culture that supports sound creative transportation alternatives for our students faculty and staff
7880034 we are delighted that this convenient economical and environmentally friendly option is now available on campus to the university community and area residents
7880035 we know that the average student searches several travel day combinations when booking air travel our new site does the work for you providing students with the best fares across more itineraries with one search
7880036 we made a real investment in technology to help make it possible for college students and faculty to find cheaper fares faster
7880037 not only will the improvements in search technology help students get more results faster but a new clean and streamlined look will make it even easier for students to find what they are looking for
7880038 we are not a huge company telling students what they want we are a small company listening to students and enhancing our web site based on specific feedback
7880039 students can be more flexible with travel dates and price is most important when booking travel with the new flexible search functionality at studentuniverse com students can see the different prices for up to a weeks worth of travel dates and can be confident they are getting a good deal

7880041 like many an english lad before him vocalist richard ashcroft puts the sneer into soul his fine sandpaper voice tempers the musics heavenward thrust its satisfying this blend of the angelic and the blokeish but on forth it never feels very urgent or original if an anthem deficiency is what ails you this album is a perfectly useful over the counter treatment just dont expect the trip to take you anywhere new
7880042 you get the impression that for guitarist nick mccabe life in the verve has been one long battle with ashcrofts ego rumours already abound that he will be leaving the band again before long but its mccabes self possessed musicianship that makes forth worth hearing he is consumed by the alchemists belief that such base materials as guitars and amps can be transformed into gold sometimes he fails but when he succeeds its sublime
7880043 while many bands who reunite years after they parted cant find the old thread or cant advance it the verve has taken their core character and moved it a bracing step ahead
7880044 but appalachian springs gives the best afterglow built on the ballad prayer model of the drugs dont work on 1997s urban hymns and coated in mccabes melting guitars and ashcrofts higher than you bleating it is forth s final trackk and most complete trip
7880045 it is a great honor to receive this recognition because it reflects passengers opinions from all over the world their preference is the best motivator for the efforts that we put forth daily in offering consistent and differentiating excellence in service with the goal of offering the best travel experience possible
7880046 we have long understood the challenges organizations face with identity verification in a best case scenario they must make a major investment in resources that dont directly align with the corporate mission which is counterintuitive with our outsourced idaas model
7880047 by teaming with nna a trusted identity provider in the industry we can alleviate this burden with a solution executed by specialized notaries companies now have a choice they can stick with the premium version of fis and handle identity verification themselves or they can select the new standard version of fis and allow exostar and the nna using its trusted network of specialized notaries to do it for them
7880048 identity assurance and signature authentications are the cornerstones of a notarys job function our members pride themselves on executing those responsibilities flawlessly on a daily basis
7880049 thats why our partnership with exostar for identity verification as part of the digital credentialing process makes perfect sense exostars vision for idaas is unparalleled and they are clearly setting the standard for the a amp d industry with this groundbreaking agreement and service offering

7880083 research tells us that by 2010 the amount of wealth controlled by women will hit more than 22 trillion and in that time women will hold half the fortune 500s top 20 jobs we recognize the changing role of wealth in womens lives and our fee only structure allows us to focus on the relationship that is so important to women our female clients seem to appreciate the fact that we dont sell products we just offer the best thinking of all of our experienced professionals this assures them we offer unbiased advice with only their best interests in mind the fact that were consistently recognized as a top financial planning and wealth management firm tells me this is the right way to go
7880084 the firm met or exceeded every expectation we have for holistic client centric firms
7880085 our firm has always been about attracting the best and the brightest minds in the financial advisory field thats certainly a key to our success more importantly its the consistent communication and the personal relationships many of our client relationships span 30 years thats when you know youre doing something well
7880086 i cant think of any other reason or any other party with an interest
7880087 these are professional provocateurs and we did not want to cooperate with that on the open seas
7880088 instead of letting the entire international press obsess about this for a week the boats received almost no coverage simply because there was no confrontation
7880089 this decision was about these boats we will see what happens with any future boats

7880094 this speech will be history in the making and will be watched by millions its so much better fun if you can have a flutter on it too im told that obama has some irish ancestry so im sure he wont be short of a word or two it would be quite funny if he opened up with life is like a box of chocolates who knows maybe hell have a bet and do just that
7880095 republicans who are thinking about holding their nose and voting for mccain out of fear of obama are going to experience their worst fears anyway
7880096 mccain will govern much like obama for four years be a one term president and leave us in 2012 with a democratic president probably obama or possibly hillary clinton
7880097 none of the above why 2008 is the year to cast the ultimate protest vote

7880153 we dont necessarily run everything that they do and vice versa
7880154 but i think the biggest thing is you have a driver over there thats going to prove to the world that he is better than who theyve put in his car at hendrick
7880155 youve got a team that has been through hell for four or five years they are all working well together they all want to be together and thats a big thing theyre not sitting there talking about contracts theyre not talking about this and that theyve got all their stuff done theyre racing together and moving forward theres no distractions with a lot to prove over there and thats a great recipe for success
7880156 it just continuously changes week after week you dont do necessarily the same thing you did last week youre just always trying to make things better some days its frustrating some days its exciting because its challenging

7880170 she talked about how important it is to help the hispanic community because a lot of the things being done are just not fair

7880172 all the people that voted for her in kansas they need to have their voices heard
7880173 i need to talk for them because all our other superdelegates support barack obama
7880174 i guess its just because i dont know him very well

7880456 i went into the los angeles thinking tactics workshop with a couple of problems to think about one which i thought was unsolvable i worked on it in one of the exercises and saw what to do jean gave me a method to follow
7880457 everyone i spoke to during the breaks felt as if jean tailored the workshop for them considering the varieties of professions and personalities that were represented it is clear that thinking tactics can benefit anyone who wants to think
7880458 whether they are managers or engineers lawyers or marketing specialists they solve problems for the business make business decisions and dig up facts the business needs they are the brains of a company but no matter how bright or motivated they are sometimes theyll hit a mental block such as overload or uncertainty this happens most often when they are moving outside their comfort zone on the most creative and difficult tasks my goal in thinking tactics is to teach them exactly what to do when they hit these mental obstacles i want to help them leverage their own expertise so they can get more top level work done with the same mental effort

7880527 the sudden war in the caucasus brought georgia to heel reasserted russias claim as the dominant force in the region and dealt a blow to u s prestige but in this part of the world diplomacy and war are about oil and gas as much as they are about hegemony and the tragic loss of human life victory in georgia now gives russia the edge in the struggle over access to the caspians 35 billion barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of gas the probable losers the u s and those western oil companies that have bet heavily on the caspian as one of the few regions where they could still operate with relative freedom

7880562 absolutely not absolutely not this is not a criminal thing
7880563 marked by mysterious secrets among the cutting edge crew an explosive showdown with an elusive arms dealer
7880564 i think the idea was to build up the mystery where is frannie what happened to her is she coming back or not
7880565 so hopefully that played well when she did return in the fourth episode i think it was a bit of a surprise
7880566 i think well see in this episode that she genuinely cares about casey and is sorry but she cares about evan too she has feelings for him i think theyre real its not just a game
7880567 is casey wrong to not support frannie because hey she gave evan up or is frannie wrong to pick a guy over the friendship with casey whats right or wrong depends on where youre standing i think very interesting
7880568 jake mcdorman often will say that he wishes evan were a nicer guy he feels like he looks like such a jerk all the time
7880569 i dont really think evans a jerk i think hes just caught up in the circumstances of his life being from money and having this image that comes from that hes juggling it the best he can the kids in college for crying out loud hes not going to know how to handle everything and i think he has good intentions even if he goes about it the wrong way
7880570 whenever a person loses their life it is definitely a sad situation especially a guy like gene who has been a tremendous asset not only to the nfl but to the players
7880571 we lose a lot of knowledge a great person a great human being and someone who was leading in the right direction
7880572 he would help various staff members in all kinds of ways of course he never wanted anyone to know
7880573 if you came to him with a problem more often than not hed open his wallet give his time anything
7880574 he adored his family he was a good friend to many and his staff at the nflpa and players inc now nfl players loved and respected him
7880575 he had a great sense of humor and his infamous texasisms will long be remembered right now hes probably saying shoot whats the big fuss about yall go on and have a party even though he was a lousy dancer he would be there with his dancin shoes on those are some very big shoes to fill i will truly miss him
7880576 i have to tell you that at no time in my life have we had any experience like this
7880577 to this you will always be our hero struggling newlyweds would be so lucky to find a wonderful person as yourself to cross their path
7880578 to have someone of genes age and the way he carried himself to all of a sudden receive a phone call that gene has passed away was a huge shock to me
7880579 from where the union started to where it is today is leaps and bounds a lot of that credit has to go with gene and what he stood for
7880580 he stood his ground on a lot of key issues with the backing of the players he was able to get us in a pretty good position hes left us in a very good position
7880581 i rank him in the top five men in the history of this game and i dont know anyone who can sit there and dispute it
7880582 the one thing we always shared what is going to be the hardest to find in replacing him is the passion and love for the national football league the game meant more to him than his own personal gains
7880583 gene was a leader mentor and friend to me and many others throughout his lifetime
7880584 as gene would have wanted the nfl players association will continue to move forward in making the nfl the greatest professional sports league in the country
7880585 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
7880586 we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
7880587 genes accomplishments for our union obviously speak for themselves but for me it was that incredible personal touch he had with everyone he met
7880588 youll hear wonderful well deserved compliments about him from players owners and other notables but you wont hear the hundreds of messages weve gotten from people who worked at his favorite coffee shop his sons school or the other places he visited in his daily life
7880589 they are all the same he was always so nice to me and that was because they were just as important to him as anyone else
7880590 he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
7880591 the nflpa had a heroic leader who gave the membership effective free agency guaranteed monies effectively at 60 percent of football revenues an effective and incrementally increasing salary cap and improvements in franchise and transition rules default provisions and rookie contract lengths
7880592 the nflpa had a heroic leader who gave the union financial viability and institutional respect
7880593 i had a friend who i consider heroic and i mourn his loss
7880594 playing alongside of gene was an honor and a privilege
7880595 he was a pillar of strength and leadership for our great raider teams
7880596 as a player in the raider locker room and as a leader in the boardroom gene was fearless in his efforts to ensure that the players both active and retired were treated fairly even though he was larger than life he only used the spotlight to further the interests of the players
7880597 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field genes tremendous love of the game also showed in his wide ranging support of football at all levels genes positive impact and legacy will live on for decades to come
7880598 hopefully everyone in this locker room recognizes that theyre a lot better for having gene as their leader he did so much every guy in this locker room can say they benefited from his leadership the league has benefited from his leadership our game is better from his leadership he is definitely going to be missed we had a lot of great meetings there were a lot of times when we obviously had to take care of work it was a serious approach but behind closed doors we would sit and laugh and talk really he is a player and i think sometimes people forget that gene upshaw was a hall of fame offensive lineman he was one of the guys you really couldnt get him to talk much about his raider days he would shed a little bit of light on it most hall of fame players let you know theyre in the hall of fame if youre around gene long enough obviously i remember because i remember watching him play but he wasnt the type of guy that would always talk about his accomplishments his main focus was the union and thats what he lived for
7880599 gene upshaw was a good friend an inspiring leader and a tireless and effective champion of players in the nfl i cant imagine a world without genes larger than life presence my thoughts and prayers are with everyone there at the nflpa he was a giant and we will all miss him
7880600 in his position representing the players i felt like gene was always very frank and fair when he came in and visited the club he wouldnt come here to visit without wanting to sit down and talk for 15 minutes to see how our players were doing and what else was going on how were they doing how was i doing a time didnt go by when he didnt do that and i appreciated that its a big loss for the nfl community
7880601 we are very deeply saddened to hear of the passing of gene upshaw gene upshaw was very supportive in the formation and operation of the national football players fathers association he was gracious enough to accept in person our living legends award in miami in 2007 it meant a lot to us to have him show his support and give the wonderful comments and words during the ceremony we wish to express our heartfelt condolences and prayers to his wife and family he will be missed
7880602 with genes passing the nfl has lost an innovator players have lost their advocate and i have lost a friend a hall of fame player gene was also a hall of fame businessman and negotiator he always had the best interests of the nfl players at heart and that played a large role in building our league to the prominence it enjoys today my prayers and the prayers of the washington redskins organization go out to his family at this sad time
7880603 on behalf of the philadelphia eagles i am very saddened and shocked to learn of gene upshaws passing whether it was as a hall of fame offensive lineman with the oakland raiders or as executive director of the nfl players association gene was a tremendous leader and a wonderful person gene always believed the best way to build the popularity of our sport was to craft a dynamic partnership between the players and the owners that served the best interest of the fans we as well as the entire nfl family will miss his presence dearly and our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons

7880617 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
7880618 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
7880619 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
7880620 many monasteries in italy are dying because of a lack of religious vocations
7880621 why its ok i got a tattoo of my fiances name
7880622 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them

7880624 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision

7880634 if you knew worksafe was going to start policing it the moment it was proclaimed we would have to make sure that we were covered
7880635 this will add significant cost to building a new home or undertaking improvements and i dont see the logic of having to apply practices that have been in place in nsw and have seriously impacted on affordability in that state
7880636 its just not so theres just no evidence to show that in any form
7880637 instead of working off rusty old 44 gallon drums and orange crates you find yourself in a stable work environment then you can actually do your job
7880638 its our view that besides making it safer it will actually make it more productive
7880639 but at the same time if one person is saved because of 10 000 is that too much to ask

7880641 our position is that this country doesnt have a state president
7880642 landmark agreements should be concluded with the expectation that everyone will sign up

7880687 we were thrilled when ashley agreed to share her proactiv success story with australia
7880688 acne sufferers feel so insecure about their looks its such an emotional issue its really powerful to see a gorgeous young model like ashley talk about what she went through
7880689 people who can afford the most luxurious skincare choose proactiv

7880698 it also provides our alumni and fans in the region the opportunity to see us in a fabulous venue the exposure of playing in an nba arena will hopefully prepare us for what we would see in the postseason
7880699 we are fortunate to have the opportunity to play at tradition rich programs like kentucky and marquette we also play two teams from the missouri valley conference and three from the horizon league which will be comparable to the competition we see in the mac

7880712 we wanted to make buddybackup completely free for everyone to use and to remove the limitations that previously were only unlocked in the paid version we didnt think it was fair to do this when so many users had already bought the software so we decided to offer a refund to everyone who has paid and upgrade all current users to the full version of the software
7880713 we are contacting all users through their registration email to let them know they are entitled to a refund any unclaimed money will be donated to a multiple sclerosis charity and save the children because buddybackup is used by people from all over the world we wanted to give to global charities as well as the united kingdom and u s a we have large user bases in china vietnam india and many other eastern and european countries so we thought it right to find charities that would be relevant to all our users

7880729 since the beginning weve pushed the envelope to offer everything a customer needs to conceive create design duplicate and package a piece of audio or video media

7880732 it takes a lot of planning that goes into each event this conference the 7th is no different
7880733 special attention is paid to each detail the quality of each speaker and the pertinence of their topic
7880734 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7880735 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7880736 our second annual inc 5000 continues the most ambitious project in business journalism
7880737 the inc 5000 gives an unrivalled portrait of young underreported companies across all industries doing fascinating things with cutting edge business models as well as older companies that are still showing impressive growth

7880740 i am taking legal action as its so silly i know young girls look up to me and you know i am a mother of three how and why would i put my health in any situation like that its totally without foundation
7880741 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7880742 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7880743 fundamental breakthroughs in these directions are expected on a time scale of 10 to 20 years and are recognized by the international science community as major milestones on the road to a renewable fuel
7880744 molecular bioenergetics of cyanobacteria towards systems biology level of understanding
7880745 we were unaware of the many issues surrounding shark fin soup after reading about it we decided to immediately stop offering it its the responsible thing to do these animals should not be slaughtered and pushed to extinction for a bowl of soup
7880746 we hope other restaurants will join us and make florida a shark friendly state
7880747 we commend ivory mandarin bistro for its compassionate decision mr sritrairasri and mr wu clearly care about the marine ecosystem and its commendable that they have taken this responsible step
7880748 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals
7880749 it was only by spending three years in the lab learning how to physically make these tools that we were able to finally replicate them accurately enough to come up with our findings
7880750 because bats can detect objects with echolocation they seldom collide with man made structures
7880751 an atmospheric pressure drop at wind turbine blades is an undetectable and potentially unforeseeable hazard for bats thus partially explaining the large number of bat fatalities at these specific structures
7880752 given that bats are more susceptible to barotrauma than birds and that bat fatalities at wind turbines far outnumber bird fatalities at most sites wildlife fatalities at wind turbines are now a bat issue not a bird issue
7880753 slow reproductive rates can limit a populations ability to recover from crashes and thereby increase the risk of endangerment or extinction
7880754 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters
7880755 as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7880756 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much
7880757 so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation
7880758 if this is all it takes to change genitalia it may be easier to make new species than we thought
7880759 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
7880760 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
7880761 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
7880762 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago
7880763 the shortage of mortgage funding is creating similar problems for buy to let landlords as it is for other borrowers
7880764 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7880765 this vote means that malaysians want a change we are entering parliament with a clear agenda its time that you behave and accept the stark realities of the day
7880766 i think it will definitely be an important milestone and also an important yardstick on abdullahs administrations continuity and also popularity but i think most importantly it will also be a voice of discontent which should barisan national lose this by election i think it will definitely be a yardstick of peoples continuous rejection of the communal formula presented by barisan national
7880767 los movimientos que leg timamente pueda hacer un partido no involucran al gobierno
7880768 los movimientos que leg timamente pueda hacer un partido no involucran al gobierno no corresponde entrar al gobierno catal n en los movimientos que hacen los partidos por su cuenta y riesgo en el frente de madrid

7880776 the strengthening dollar and more bad news for economic growth worldwide are putting downward pressure on prices but its hurricane season and gustav has reached hurricane status
7880777 while it is far too early for definitive forecasts of its path there is a possibility for it to pass over the western side of cuba and into the gulf of mexico oil producing region next week
7880778 gustav will be the major driver of prices this week
7880779 for all the hand wringing that this storm may cause we should remember that the price sell offs following storm systems that have failed have usually far outpaced the initial run higher
7880780 this is not an easy choice to make but it represents the only possibility to save human lives
7880781 poor german ifo and gdp data highlighted the frailties of the european economy and once again sparked fears that a global slowdown would result in reduced demand for oil
7880782 they liked it so much they are bringing us back for some encore time to beef it up add a little salt and pepper

7880786 the benefits of the program accrued very quickly and are very large
7880787 when adults stop smoking you see immediate benefits in heart disease with impacts on cancer and lung diseases starting to appear a year or two later
7880788 we confirmed these results with a wide range of model reliability tests and sensitivity analyses to make sure that the findings we found were not a result of some unobserved third factor
7880789 for example including differences between california and the control states on a variety of risk factors did not materially affect the results
7880790 the methods in this study can be used to forecast future costs and will provide important additional means for validating program evaluations that previously did not exist
7880791 large scale tobacco control programs should be an integral part of the medical cost containment that everyone agrees must be part of any health care reform
7880792 at driverside we spend all our time trying to save motorists money and make auto ownership easier purchasing fairbenjamin allows us to do more of both

7880810 georgia regards europe as a partner which is able to render not only financial but also political assistance
7880811 this offers him and his family security both on and off the field
7880812 one of the issues raised was the terrific development that tony has overseen of greg fleming
7880813 he has gone from being a rookie goalkeeper to playing in the spl and gaining international recognition
7880814 as a consequence of gregs progress we felt that tony could inhibit his development further by staying in the team and it is an opportunity to promote greg back into the number one jersey
7880815 impossible to conduct business as usual in the framework of the nato russia council

7880823 there will be criticism from some inside and outside the company that these changes particularly in editorial will compromise quality and critical mass in the metro mastheads and their mission
7880824 we reject that this initiative has been carefully constructed by the publishers with full regard for the integrity of their mastheads our mastheads will remain true to their heritage and their values of quality andexcellence
7880825 you would expect them to say they can maintain quality
7880826 time will tell but you will not find many editors who have figured out how you can lose several hundred staff and keep up the quality without a magic potion
7880827 i was responsible for starting a lot of these sections at a time when the smh had no sections at all
7880828 but the newspapers have gone far too far down the lifestyle track they have done it because they believe these sections command benefits in additional advertising
7880829 after fuelling growth in these sections for two decades it would now be not a bad thing at all if the reduction in costs came from cuts to lifestyle
7880830 what those of us who care about journalism say is that there should be less of this death by a thousand cuts and a deeper analysis and reinvention
7880831 we dont manufacture widgets here or car tyres we responsibly provide information to people
7880832 the point we make is that quality depends on individual journalists and the teams of journalists they put together they seem to want to actively break up the teams and the esprit de corps
7880833 management simply doesnt value quality and this new round of redundancies is another example of it
7880834 you cant expect quality wont be affected when you take out so many
7880835 the people likely to go are the most experienced and valued journalists whom fairfax sees as the most expensive newspapers all over the world are struggling and the ones that are doing better are the ones who are investing in their staff
7880836 we must tell people what they want to know and even more important what they might not want to know about war politics economics schools corruption and the thoughts and deeds of those who lead us we need to tell readers more about barack obama and less about britney spears
7880837 if you look at readership and circulation trends over the last few years newspapers with markets that are very clearly defined very targeted are still growing
7880838 this includes regional dailies like the geelong advertiser and townsville daily bulletin or the gold coast bulletin the national daily the australian its a serious political newspaper were still growing i think the fin is holding on better than the smh and the age it knows its market it is a business newspaper but its those papers that are trying to be all things to all people in the capital cities that are struggling
7880839 its instructive that management at fairfax sees that their core business is in fact lifestyle journalism because lifestyle journalism is just as vulnerable to the internet as classifieds were
7880840 theres not much in lifestyle journalism that you cant get provided easily online and its very cheap for internet providers
7880841 i knew the moment i started reading depth takes a holiday that sandra was a kindred spirit
7880842 both of our books contained the phrase danskin crotch panel
7880843 sandras new book works on several levels including my own
7880844 theres something very satisfying about reading an account of someone who has a lot of initial anxiety about putting her kid in a public school but who ends up becoming an advocate and activist for public education ill be interested to find out from her at the reading now much of the hysteria about getting your child into a good school is genuine concern for the childs education and welfare and how much is status anxiety
7880845 i love the part where sandra puts all her jonathon kozol books into a wicker basket as if getting ready to drown them thats good stuff
7880846 a search for wisdom from old people while they are still on this earth
7880847 id always thought sandra was exaggerating when she said he uses a frosted flakes box as his briefcase

7880874 now that the u s breached the agreed points the north is compelled to take
7880875 the work ahead is to get that verification mechanism and therefore to proceed with denuclearization
7880876 we actually are in discussions with the north koreans and i think well just see where we come out in a few weeks
7880877 its regrettable that this announcement came at a time when each side has been trying
7880878 i hope north korea will resume disablement measures at an early date
7880879 i think this represents the biggest crisis to the denuclearization process since the feb 13 agreement
7880880 the norths kim jong il may have decided that he wont negotiate with the bush administration any more

7880883 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7880884 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7880912 weve always been going by the old school thing of picking a guy and sticking with him and getting him ready
7880913 in the preseason you have the luxury of getting quarterbacks a lot of reps weve had 26 practices we can pick and choose when they get reps i dont think any of them is lacking for reps right now but when youre limited on the number of days you have to get ready for the next opponent i think it is extremely important to get one guy more reps than the other guy because you plan on him playing

7880918 i suppose it helped doing the dvd commentary for genesis of the daleks
7880919 which i hadnt seen since 1975 when it went out i watched it again for the first time what two years ago and i appreciated it so much more davros is such an iconic thing and meeting him again was bizarre
7880920 in the sarah jane adventures im almost a different kind of sarah jane because of the kids you kind of have to be people have different facets to themselves though so thats allowed when i go back to doctor who oh i love it i go a bit more i suppose girly sarah jane at my age i thought maybe i shouldnt but i cant help it i see the doctor and all of a sudden thats my doctor again it frees me in a way that i cant be when in responsible parent mode
7880921 im going to try to bring a bit of that freedom to it in the second series of sarah jane i think i should let go a bit more i think people sopmetimes think im rather acquiescent but i just work in my own way
7880922 yeah i youtubed her theres a massive difference wobbly sets and all that apparently graeme harper worked on older doctor whos too he was telling me that theyd have egg cartons on the walls and colour them in so that they looked like computer buttons it sounds brilliant
7880923 i dont need any gizmos and tricks my voice doesnt have to be put through a modulator it seems to be part of me he sighs i only wish people would cast me as something else
7880924 i hope this starts a new era of really innovative childrens programming because the bar has now been set incredibly high its storytelling that doesnt mess about kids have to deal with some quite harsh things in the show but life is dangerous and a little bit scary
7880925 when phil ford was putting all the elements together for the finale he knew that the threat was so great sarah jane would need more than the support of her regular gang shed need one of her oldest and best friends at her side and dont think sir alistairs going to take it easy because there are more old faces returning in the finale some of whom no one will be glad to see

7880955 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado

7881099 when we considered system functionality company reputation and the strength of the episys customer base symitar became our clear choice we expect great things from this stable reliable widely implemented system and know that symitar is an ideal cultural fit for our credit union which is extremely important to our day to day business relationship
7881100 every aspect of this technically challenging engagement from project management and programming to hardware support and training was executed with a high level of professionalism and dedication and thereby affirmed westerns decision to become a symitar client
7881101 since being acquired by jack henry amp associates eight years ago we have more than doubled our episys client base by participating in the competitive technology evaluations conducted by diverse credit unions and building our customer base one win at a time rather than through the acquisition and conversion of competitive customer bases and during fiscal year 2008 we continued to increase our market share by replacing competitive platforms we believe the diversity of these 30 credit unions clearly demonstrates the industry wide appeal of our technology platforms episys and cruise were selected to replace 12 different competitive systems by credit unions that are located in 20 states with assets ranging from approximately 3 million to more than 1 4 billion and with member bases ranging from a start up credit union to one with more than 120 000 members the credit unions added to our client roster this year also have an average asset size that is more than double the average asset size of the clients added during fiscal year 2007
7881102 according to data published by the national credit union association the average net gain in new clients for symitars major competitors during our most recent fiscal year was less than one episys has replaced every major competitive system and represents the largest organic user base in the industry which was built through the competitive evaluations conducted by more than 500 individual credit unions rather than through the conversion of acquired client bases episys is also recognized as the technology platform of choice for more credit unions with assets exceeding 25 million than any other alternative including more than 30 percent of the 127 credit unions with assets exceeding 1 billion and six corporate credit unions our client retention rate of approximately 99 percent during symitars 23 year history also provides a rewarding point of competitive distinction
7881103 real median household income in the united states climbed 1 3 percent between 2006 and 2007 reaching 50 233

7881139 ik vind dat the osbournes het publieke beeld van mijn vader heeft verpest door hem neer te zetten als een beetje een seniele grappige stuntelende man
7881140 i think it is more down to the simple fact that theres no point in running into the gear box
7881141 we had 17 films in production between january and june which is unheard of
7881142 we all had to prepare for the worst case scenario
7881143 his movies are so humanistic in a genre that frequently passes by that element
7881144 all of his movies became kind of funny and bright even mistakes like atlantis the lost continent which is sort of an italian movie that isnt an italian movie and is really a pretty silly picture there is a geniality to his movies he stamped his personality on them whether he directed them or not
7881145 there is wistfulness about it thats really absent from most science fiction films
7881146 its a moving film on a level that most movies of that type didnt even try to reach
7881147 the higher ups at fox are not too impressed the footage that has been shot thus far and are seriously debating shutting the whole thing down the movie supposedly has a budget of over 100 million and i can understand them wanting to cut some losses while they still can
7881148 20th century fox states the information reported was false and the film is still scheduled for an april 2009 release
7881149 the first movie is all about the mystery and reveal of the transformers as a concept and a species which means we had to hide them a lot in the first hour in the second movie now that everyone believes in the universe we can jump right into the world of the transformers the first movie was meant to be somewhat of a mystery for the sequel we need an entirely different structure and paradigm for the movie and we cant rely on it being the first
7881150 we were emulating the style of movie from the old amblin days like back to the future and gremlins also comedy makes things more accessible to a larger audience
7881151 yes waldo has infiltrated our film and he can be seen in almost every crowd shot taking place at hogwarts
7881152 the problem is not these few scenes in fact the problem is every other scene waldo has such an uncanny ability to hide that we have had to go back through the film frame by frame and look for him that is something like 684 000 frames ilm has had to go through just looking for the blasted man
7881153 so often i have to lie and make up half truths about what really is going on with any one of our films we felt releasing this behind the scenes image without actually telling anyone he was there would allow fans to realize just how hard it actually is to find waldo we just couldnt make the planned november release and had to delay
7881154 as we are in an aggressive growth and expansion mode we want the brand to reflect the same
7881155 through the tv commercial we have tried to highlight the basic human tendency of desire for more whether it is applied to what we do or the customers we serve

7881159 we did the best we could with the research we could find along with public testimony and other outreach we did to come up with a draft rule that we felt would work
7881160 whatever feedback that im getting and whenever the people come up to me and say that they are really looking forward to my film thats very encouraging and acts like a moral booster for me we have worked very hard for something that is not considered normal as the film has rock band in the background im also very sure that the emotional content of this film is something that the people will connect with so im very excited and i am looking forward to sharing this movie with the audience
7881161 i play a sophisticated south mumbai girl in this film my characters name is sakhshi she is a very calm girl and handles all her situations very calmly she can compromise everything for the person she loves the most to see him happy
7881162 we have organised this prayer to pay for the souls of the victims of the ahmedabad blasts we organised fire rituals to pray for the victims

7881167 and they better include me or ill put a bullet in my head
7881168 thats been the problem in the past to try and get everybody together at the same time but we are aiming for next year and i hope it can all be worked out i miss those people i miss the writing

7881178 the market closes on monday but we will make other signings following shevchenko and senderos
7881179 coach carlo ancelotti should be very pleased with the signings now it is up to him to not fail and help us to win the scudetto
7881180 our fans should be calm as always in the return of sheva we never talked about kaka with chelsea
7881181 i am playing great and the ryder cup is a huge thing for everyone but i have other things that i want to do as well
7881182 i want to move up the world rankings and order of merit and gleneagles is another big tournament
7881183 at the end of the year i want to be sitting down having my christmas lunch thinking that i am in all the big tournaments again next year
7881184 we are planning on staying hurdling at the moment anyhow
7881185 well give him a couple of runs and see how he goes but he is only six turning seven
7881186 if hes nearly top class at that hurdling we may as well stay at it thats alans thought anyway
7881187 hes back in now and hes in great form he looks amazing so we are delighted with him at the moment
7881188 it broke my heart last year to do some of the things i was doing
7881189 it really went against the grain what we had to do in europe because of the perilous position we were in the premiership so we were changing it
7881190 we werent trying to get ourselves knocked out of the fa cup or carling cup or uefa cup but we couldve picked stronger teams
7881191 were going to give it everything weve possibly got to win the competitions that were entering
7881192 last year we had issues because of our league position so that had to be where we prioritised
7881193 it is the same situation we are working hard on trying to improve the squad if possible
7881194 we have a better squad and we were starting to play really well at the end of pre season
7881195 then we started playing bad but the only positive thing is that we are winning
7881196 it is really good if you can win without playing well because it means that when you start to play well it will be easier
7881197 i am confident we will improve and if it is like this i am sure we will continue winning
7881198 we have been chasing him for a while but obviously the finances involved along with a couple of other things did not make it possible until now
7881199 he is a player i have full admiration for i remember him at aberdeen where he was held in such high esteem that sunderland eventually paid 1m for his services
7881200 unfortunately he had no sooner signed than he picked up an injury and obviously he ended up finding it hard to get back into roy keanes side

7881207 fue que todos peleamos que todos estaban metidos que estaban con el compromiso lo cual es lo m s importante la verdad tuvimos muchas jugadas de gol nos falt concretar pero gracias a dios metimos un gol en t ctica fija

7881218 los equipo mexicanos tienen una din mica especial que han progresado en los ltimos a os y sin duda va a ser un partido sumamente dif cil esperamos contrarrestar el futbol que ellos tienen y tratar de hacer nosotros nuestro juego

7881372 obama doesnt accept campaign contributions from lobbyists or political action committees but thats a change from his past practices he accepted their donations until he launched his presidential campaign
7881373 obamas us senate campaign committee starting with his successful run in 2004 has collected 128 000 from lobbyists and 1 3 million from pacs according to the center for responsive politics a nonprofit organization that tracks money in politics
7881374 pacs and lobbyists aided obamas rise data contrast with his theme
7881375 in obamas eight years in the illinois senate from 1996 to 2004 almost two thirds of the money he raised for his campaigns 296 000 of 461 000 came from pacs corporate contributions or unions according to illinois board of elections records
7881376 pacs and lobbyists aided obamas rise data contrast with his theme

7881388 at rice we are mindful of the impact our students transportation choices have on our campus the community and the environment as a whole
7881389 by bringing car sharing to our campus we can encourage students to leave their own vehicles at home during the school year while teaching them to make sustainable transportation choices that we hope will extend beyond their college years
7881390 i view the zipcar concept as an important component in rices efforts to become a climate neutral campus the program will reduce our transportation related greenhouse gas emissions while providing cheap high quality mobility on demand
7881391 we used this property from about 1958 to around 1975 for our local train operation we then moved on to our main line but this has been our storage area for many many years
7881392 we leased this land in 1956 from the puget power company who has the dam and the facilities around here
7881393 we now use this for storage and will soon have a new storage area in the north part of town here

7881398 republicans who are thinking about holding their nose and voting for mccain out of fear of obama are going to experience their worst fears anyway
7881399 mccain will govern much like obama for four years be a one term president and leave us in 2012 with a democratic president probably obama or possibly hillary clinton
7881400 none of the above why 2008 is the year to cast the ultimate protest vote

7881404 we do not have a police force to create policy theyre here to enforce the law

7881411 the array of animal free products i will have in my toolkit will enable me to provide innovative cost efficient time saving and safe solutions to both existing and future invitria customers
7881412 for example cellastim an albumin used to replace bovine albumin and human albumin as a cell culture ingredient and biopharmaceutical formulation excipient has been shown to improve mammalian cell culture productivity by up to 50 when compared with other forms of albumin
7881413 these animal free products represent the future in this industry the holy grail of ingredients for the cell culture market and i am extremely proud to represent them as a part of the invitria team

7881417 zipcar offers a wonderful way for bowdoin students faculty and staff to take cars off the road and reduce our carbon footprint
7881418 beginning with the class of 2013 first year students will no longer be able to have cars on campus and zipcar will provide an inexpensive and convenient alternative for them and for our upper class students faculty and staff thanks to zipcar over time i expect well see fewer students with cars and more one car families
7881419 this is just one more in a long list of initiatives that colby has undertaken to reduce our carbon footprint
7881420 the zipcars allow students with cars to leave them at home if they want and it adds a transportation option for those who dont have cars its an all around good idea
7881421 the partnership with zipcar will help us further our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint and create a culture that supports sound creative transportation alternatives for our students faculty and staff
7881422 we are delighted that this convenient economical and environmentally friendly option is now available on campus to the university community and area residents
7881423 he wanted to transform the world so that everyone would be happy but he only hung by a thread for you see he was in fact made out of paper
7881424 in addition to his celebrity status creativity and high energy dieterle brings with him the insight of a restaurant owner and chef who has overseen the preparation of thousands of meals in fast paced settings
7881425 were looking forward to him running our chefs dream kitchen through a rigorous workout and offering his expertise to our design team
7881426 im excited about cooking up some of my favorite recipes in beazers model homes
7881427 beazers spacious and thoughtfully planned kitchens are designed to support everything from food preparation to family gatherings
7881428 todays kitchens serve a command central role in the home
7881429 theres got to be plenty of room and functionality built in to accommodate cooking plus entertaining socializing and more mundane tasks like processing mail or doing homework
7881430 this speech will be history in the making and will be watched by millions its so much better fun if you can have a flutter on it too im told that obama has some irish ancestry so im sure he wont be short of a word or two it would be quite funny if he opened up with life is like a box of chocolates who knows maybe hell have a bet and do just that
7881431 hopefully i can provide some assistance in the future to this school and all that it can be
7881432 i know you are working very hard and struggling to bring up this school but i have said i will assist the school and i will do so
7881433 senator obama has not honored the promises he gave me when we met in 2006 and in his earlier letter to the school
7881434 he has not given us even one shilling but we still have hope

7881437 we are extremely disappointed with the decision made by myspace and fox interactive to delete our account
7881438 myspace was a great way for us to keep in touch with our pool playing friends and customers so the loss of franks myspace page is not an insignificant loss
7881439 i cant believe they kicked me out of my home without even telling me why its ok though because mike promised me that hed build me a new home where i can blog keep my pictures talk about my adventures with debbie schjodt and keep in touch with my friends

7881441 lets sit around in a drum circle and hum our energy
7881442 i may have been the crazy one but he was either attracted to crazy or had his reasons for being with crazy but if you looked at each of us in the relationship i was the crazy one i was the bad guy well i was the one who was acting it out
7881443 no matter what happens this is how you will win you get to show them that youre down but youre not out youre not dead
7881444 the only thing you can change is you and the amends you need to make are made when you change and send the good of those changes out into the world
7881445 we have long understood the challenges organizations face with identity verification in a best case scenario they must make a major investment in resources that dont directly align with the corporate mission which is counterintuitive with our outsourced idaas model
7881446 by teaming with nna a trusted identity provider in the industry we can alleviate this burden with a solution executed by specialized notaries companies now have a choice they can stick with the premium version of fis and handle identity verification themselves or they can select the new standard version of fis and allow exostar and the nna using its trusted network of specialized notaries to do it for them
7881447 identity assurance and signature authentications are the cornerstones of a notarys job function our members pride themselves on executing those responsibilities flawlessly on a daily basis
7881448 thats why our partnership with exostar for identity verification as part of the digital credentialing process makes perfect sense exostars vision for idaas is unparalleled and they are clearly setting the standard for the a amp d industry with this groundbreaking agreement and service offering
7881449 as the worlds population grows so will demand for food and energy using non food feedstocks for feed and energy is one way that agriculture can apply innovation to create renewable sustainable solutions
7881450 there are a number of challenges associated with harvest collection and storage of cellulosic biomass this collaborative effort brings together three agricultural leaders to identify and address the complexities that come with commercializing a new feedstock
7881451 expansions in biorenewable energy are possible if we are able to combine productivity and sustainability improvements in agriculture and forestry with a variety of biomass feedstocks and the most applicable conversion technologies
7881452 we are hopeful the collaboration of our companies will lead to innovative technologies to improve collection and provisioning of biomass feedstocks such as corn stover
7881453 advanced biotechnologies are protecting plants better than ever helping the plants to achieve their full grain yield potential
7881454 achieving this potential also means having healthier larger plants producing even more biomass this provides an opportunity to convert an underutilized resource into a new source of value for growers and processors its an exciting area of research to focus on and were pleased to be a part of it
7881455 the fact that these suppliers are still doing business with ford motor company today speaks volumes about the relationships that henry ford created a century ago
7881456 this longevity is a testament to both ford and its suppliers today we salute these special companies and look forward to another century of innovative and cutting edge technology
7881457 we are proud of these relationships and want to acknowledge the contributions made both then and now

7881465 as we get older the unfortunate truth is that our eyes strain in low light conditions we simply refuse to accept this limitation and have designed the periscope r book light in a book cover tm to provide bright even light coverage over the entire page reading enjoyment is enhanced and eye strain is reduced

7881468 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7881469 depending on where you focus on the details of the report you can see some different stories on where home prices are headed record year over year declines were reported in both the 10 city and 20 city composites in june however they are very close to the values reported for may the rate of home price decline may be slowing for the month the 10 city composite was down 0 6 and the 20 city composite was down 0 5 while still falling these are far less than the 2 2 5 monthly drops seen earlier in 2008 in june nine of the 20 cities were up month to month compared with seven in may nevertheless not one market is showing a positive return over the past 12 months and seven of the metro areas are reporting declines in excess of 20 0
7881470 considering that more than 40 states require vision screenings before children return to school and a recent survey found that 87 percent of respondents were unaware that one in four children have vision problems its very important that we provide a low cost solution for parents this back to school season and beyond
7881471 through our vision center products and services parents can ensure that their children receive the proper screenings necessary to head back to school without breaking the bank

7881476 democrats stances against free trade helped build the partys success at the polls and could tip the balance on trade matters the new dynamic could put a definitive end to the already troubled effort to reach a global agreement to reduce tariffs and open markets
7881477 peace is the natural effect of trade two nations who differ with each other become reciprocally dependent for if one has an interest in buying the other has an interest in selling and thus their union is founded on their mutual necessities
7881478 the policy implication of our finding is that further international cooperation in reducing barriers to both trade and capital flows can promote a more peaceful world

7881485 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as i am concerned thats the end of the matter
7881486 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7881487 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7881488 allegations of this nature are of course highly defamatory and they were particularly offensive to the claimant because they are simply not true
7881489 in fact as a number of his protection officers volunteered to testify in the event that this matter came to trial sir salman conducted himself with dignity and courtesy throughout a time of great personal danger and concern
7881490 they are also here to apologise unequivocally to sir salman rushdie as well as ms west for the hurt and damage which they have suffered as a result of the publication of these allegations
7881491 in view of sir salman rushdies belief in free expression he has uniquely in a british libel action not sought damages nor has sir salman asked for any opinions in the book to be altered only that the false and defamatory content be taken out
7881492 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers to an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
7881493 i am very gratified by the outcome it seems to me to have been an avoidable business the facts were not checked before publishing these allegations
7881494 my interest was solely to establish the truth over the number of serious allegations about myself elizabeth west and indeed about the behaviour of the police force
7881495 stand up in the high court and own up to being a liar
7881496 i hope it will be an original and new method by which to establish facts rather than going for enormous financial damages

7881582 this is someone who was a job killing machine in business hes someone who has been proficient at using tax havens in places like the cayman islands that americans have become increasingly tired of
7881583 i think romney is a fine man and hes always been decent to me but i have a very serious concern and i think the people of massachusetts had about his engagement in the job of he spent what was it almost 300 days of the last year of his office out of state and it was indicative of how little attention he was paying to us and weve got some serious challenges

7881603 there have been a lot of distractions lately with the rise of twenty20 cricket but the premium product is still test cricket and one of the premium events is playing india
7881604 in the short term its disappointing missing the bangladesh series but in the longer term its really good because it gives me extra time to get right for india
7881605 i want to finish off the desire i have to play one day cricket without being selfish because its important the team has plenty of time to prepare for the next world cup
7881606 thats still a long way off but i wont be ruthless about trying to push on i dont want to hang on too long
7881607 mostly due to the stress of business ownership and jet lag
7881608 you can turn a smart person into an idiot just by over tiring him
7881609 like people who have had too much to drink the chronically sleep deprived have no sense of their limitations
7881610 i would argue that all theyre doing is allowing themselves at least 12 hours to marinate the information they take in and if those 12 hours include some sleep they get even better results
7881611 usually i could fall asleep but id wake up at 1 or 2 a m and start thinking about everything i had to do
7881612 the more responsibility you have the more lack of sleep hurts you
7881613 but once you realize how it affects you deliberately depriving yourself of sleep is actually kind of dumb
7881614 learning how to shut my doors at 5 p m so i can wind down
7881615 if youve always been sleep deprived you dont know any better
7881616 but once you start sleeping enough you notice the positives
7881617 now that im aware of the effects of being overtired i remember feeling slow and dumb at 4 a m i forgot where i put my gym bag the day before and just wanted to yell
7881618 the initial idea was a site to help freshmen adjust to college
7881619 but in my sleep ive had ideas for expanding its scope such as drawing in parents sponsoring alumni events and including local part time job listings for students

7881627 all 150 of us were rounded up for a short while before police arrived and talked them down to the ground floor
7881628 i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it
7881629 gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7881630 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7881631 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7881632 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7881633 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7881634 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7881635 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7881636 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7881637 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7881638 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7881639 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7881640 that when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is its not about vocal acrobatics
7881641 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everyone will sign up
7881642 the fact that yesterday the duma and today the russian president recognized south ossetia and abkhazia is inconsistent with my and i think our understanding of the principle of territorial integrity and is consequently absolutely not acceptable
7881643 the fact that the russian governance now has chosen this path means that they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community as a whole
7881644 regrettable and we reaffirm our attachment to georgias territorial integrity
7881645 for us south ossetia and abkhazia are parts of georgia
7881646 this of course only makes sense when it is based on common values
7881647 a true partnership requires shared values and those include respecting the territorial integrity of individual states as well as the use of international mechanisms to resolve conflicts
7881648 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7881649 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7881650 whilst the results were good it appears they werent good enough to drive the share price to perform materially differently from the rest of the sector
7881651 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong standalone value proposition for shareholders
7881652 were not in a position to forecast whether chinalco will avail themselves of the flexibility that theyve now been given so well just have to wait and see
7881653 although we have seen some moderation in global growth rates from tightened availability of credit the impact on our markets has been modest
7881654 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

7881656 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7881657 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7881658 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7881659 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7881660 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7881661 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7881662 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7881663 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7881664 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7881665 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7881666 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7881667 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7881668 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7881669 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7881670 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7881671 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7881672 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7881673 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7881674 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7881675 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7881676 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7881677 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7881678 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7881679 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7881680 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7881681 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7881682 there is a deliberate policy aimed at making a separation with the palestinians impossible and this will risk forcing us to live in a single bi national state

7881688 anything that is complex is not useful and anything that is useful is simple this has been my whole lifes motto
7881689 it is unfortunate but it really has come down to this
7881690 its your people that are walking around our neighborhood committing all these crimes
7881691 what you are suggesting is putting people behind walls and thats un christian like its un jewish like its completely inhuman and unacceptable
7881692 its now a matter of letting everyone know were ready to do what we have to do to protect ourselves
7881693 i am strong advocate of the second amendment but you can go from being a victim to someone being prosecuted very easily
7881694 my fear is that someone is going to get into trouble or hurt
7881695 i believe that the constitution confers an individual right to bear arms but just because you have an individual right does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7881696 just because you have an individual right to free speech does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7881697 just because you have an individual right not to be searched unreasonably does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7881698 just because you have an individual right to freely exercise religion does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7881699 just because you have an individual right to an abortion does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7881700 just because you have an individual right to bear arms does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7881701 i believe that the constitution confers an individual right to bear arms but just because you have an individual right does not mean that the state or local government cant constrain the exercise of that right
7881702 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7881703 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7881704 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7881705 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7881706 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7881707 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7881708 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7881709 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7881710 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7881711 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7881712 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7881713 who are open to doing something on the production side
7881714 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7881715 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7881716 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7881717 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7881718 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7881719 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7881720 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7881721 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7881722 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7881723 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7881724 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7881725 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7881727 i would be happy to debate sutton shes on vacation right now i would be happy to debate her anywhere any time any place under any rules i think its reasonable to say theres diversity in this district it makes sense to have a debate in all four of the counties one in medina county one in cuyahoga one in summit one in lorain and i know full well that there are facilities that would like nothing better than to encourage the public to participate in these types of events i think it makes the process much more transparent to use some of her words
7881728 our fellow citizens living in ohios 13th congressional district have many important decisions to make in this years general election the candidates they choose to vote for in federal state and local races along with their choices on ballot initiatives will significantly impact on the lives of all who live in this wonderful district i am certain that you would agree that our fellow citizens should be provided with as much information about their candidates who are running to represent them in order for them to make an informed choice
7881729 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
7881730 it is a lie to smear him the government is doing everything they can to shame him

7881734 the person in front of meyer was told he would be the last person to speak orlando said meyer said he was upset with that so kerry gave him the ok

7881740 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7881741 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7881742 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7881743 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7881744 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7881745 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7881746 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7881747 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7881748 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

7881753 i guess i did realize that when the plane was going to take off perhaps it was not going so fast
7881754 and i said to myself something is going on here
7881755 i grabbed the seat i noticed a bump my stomach was rising and falling and then i dont remember anything else
7881756 there were children who had seats on top of them what i did was pull them out and set them aside so they were not trapped
7881757 i know a lot is being made of this but i think any human being at any time when people ask for help will give it
7881758 it is a contradictory feeling because i know that bodies are arriving back there and i will arrive intact
7881759 i noticed that the plane did not have power when it started to rise
7881760 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7881761 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7881762 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7881763 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7881764 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7881765 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7881766 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7881767 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7881768 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7881769 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7881770 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7881771 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7881772 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7881773 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7881774 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7881775 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7881776 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7881777 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7881778 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7881779 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

7881781 we do not want international forces to leave afghanistan until the time our security institutions are able to defend afghanistan independently
7881782 within the framework of afghan law with respect to international law
7881783 mission is based on a u n mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
7881784 found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7881785 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7881786 i assume that north korea recognizes that it still has obligations
7881787 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7881788 the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7881789 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7881790 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7881791 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7881792 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7881793 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7881794 there is little time left to get a solid negotiating text on the table clearly the clock is ticking
7881795 tal y como pinta la cosa ahora no quisiera arriesgarme
7881796 partimos de una situaci n que no es mala todo el mundo sabe que ser dif cil batirnos
7881797 el municipio no puede dejar inconcluso el by pass de la avenida venezuela
7881798 yes i can confirm im pregnant its still early so im being cautious im resting as much as possible
7881799 ive moved down to the beach with tito i love being by the beach
7881800 esta m sica es nuestra interpretaci n de la historia creada por pato zapato la que nos llev a sumergirnos en un universo de ideas de las cuales surgieron estas canciones
7881801 the same speech hes been giving for months why didnt he give the germans something more
7881802 it was a tent in the desert 100 degree heat off and on for what seemed like forever
7881803 why was i held by the united states like that when i was their ally
7881804 if theyre exaggerating and distorting this much in august what will october be like
7881805 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7881806 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7881807 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7881808 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7881809 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7881810 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7881811 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7881812 i walked away and said good night and walked over across the hall to the elevators
7881813 and i came back over and said excuse me what did you just say and he grabbed me by my arms and started laughing and i said no no what did you just say and he didnt repeat it and i said did you call me an uncle tom and then i came back with a barrage of things that i wont repeat publicly
7881814 what i said was come on board hes a nice clean cut guy and everything i said weve got to stop all this weve got too many doubting thomases and weve got to get together
7881815 and she was walking away and therefore she heard the last part of the word she didnt hear the whole part
7881816 if he had said doubting thomas he should have said it right then and there said no i did not say uncle tom i said doubting thomas and it would have been over with
7881817 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7881818 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7881819 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7881820 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7881821 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7881822 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7881823 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7881824 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7881825 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7881826 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7881827 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7881828 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7881829 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7881830 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7881831 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7881832 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7881833 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7881834 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7881835 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7881836 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7881837 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7881838 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7881839 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7881840 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7881841 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7881842 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7881843 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7881844 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7881845 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7881846 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7881847 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7881848 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7881849 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7881850 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7881851 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7881852 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7881853 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7881854 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7881855 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7881856 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming
7881857 sydneys largest dam warragamba has received 43mm of rain since thursday while the regions smaller dams got a better soaking including the upper nepean which got 108mm
7881858 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
7881859 environmentalists can have a sense of humour too environmentalists can have a sense of humour too
7881860 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7881861 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7881862 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7881863 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7881864 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7881865 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
7881866 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
7881867 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
7881868 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7881869 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7881870 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7881871 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7881872 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7881873 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7881874 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7881875 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7881876 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7881877 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7881878 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7881879 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7881880 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7881881 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7881882 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7881883 im a property owner we own a lot of property but we live in one or two
7881884 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7881885 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course
7881886 they invite us we wave everybody cheers we sit down
7881887 i think hes more ready for it clearly by far than i was
7881888 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7881889 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7881890 we are excited about this acquisition the strategic combination of our groups will accelerate the realization of our common aspiration that of becoming the most respected provider of business transformational services in the global marketplace we hold the management and employees of axon in high regard and look forward to welcoming them to the infosys group
7881891 it has now become clear that our previously announced target is out of reach
7881892 we were encouraged by improving volume and cost trends in the second quarter including positive feedback received from some of our valued customers
7881893 however the disappointing results we have seen over the past few weeks at the beginning of our most critical quarter indicate we will fall substantially short of our expectations for 2008 we are no longer on track to deliver our targets
7881894 the versatility of the h 264 mpeg 4 standard has been recognized and applauded across an amazing spectrum of industry its widespread versatility is testament to the flexibility and efficiency that has been engineered by a group of dedicated people
7881895 either so extensive an improvement on existing methods or so innovative in nature that they materially affect the transmission recording or reception of television
7881896 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7881897 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7881898 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7881899 about the only guy who seems to have done really well these last eight years is a guy with a private jet and so many homes that he loses count
7881900 as an investor i yearn for a president who looks to financial heroes not corporate lobbyists for economic advice as a gay man i yearn for a president who believes in equal rights for all americans but most of all as an american i yearn for a president that the world can root for and be inspired by because having much of the world on our side again would not only be good for our national security it would be good for business vote obama my fellow democrats because boy do we ever need a change
7881901 why is she getting ready when its still dark outside
7881902 whatever happened to the great streets initiative for petworth middle georgia avenue
7881903 many things are still happening in response to all the community input that we have received in the various agencies working on great streets
7881904 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7881905 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7881906 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7881907 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7881908 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7881909 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7881910 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
7881911 oftentimes one brings in celebrity for a sense of making a campaign look like its young and vibrant and visionary and all the rest of it you give it a bit of that showbiz juice the problem is that the last thing that barack obama needs is showbiz juice
7881912 hes got all the charisma hes got the speaking the whole idea of this rock star candidate is now to some extent being reframed to become a liability the democratic party has to be really careful that they dont paint themselves as a hollywood presidency kind of thing
7881913 a lot of people are beginning to realize that celebrity endorsements are doing a lot more to get you to change your mind about the celebrity than they do to get you to change your mind about a candidate
7881914 most people come to candidates with pretty set ideas of what their party is and who they like and who they dont
7881915 just because one of their favourite actors endorses someone or speaks for one of them i think its more likely that the average voter is going to say oh i used to like that celebrity but they like candidate x so i dont like that celebrity anymore
7881916 if the youth vote turns out as it did with the primaries for obama i think youre going to see a president obama
7881917 if the youth vote does as it has done in the past and that is that it always promises and looks like its going to be behind john kerry or al gore then what youre going to see is president mccain
7881918 i think it cuts both ways the candidates want celebrities there because it brings media attention but they dont want them around too much because they dont want to bring negative attention as though it is just a celebrity kind of endorsement
7881919 depending on the celebrity you might be able to register three votes but you might lose three votes there are people in hollywood who are very divisive in terms of their politics
7881920 the celebrities use it as a means of getting themselves back into the limelight
7881921 its what i would call a synergistic relationship where both sides probably benefit in a celebrity spectacle culture
7881922 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
7881923 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
7881924 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7881925 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7881926 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7881927 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7881928 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7881929 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7881930 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7881931 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7881932 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7881933 if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us
7881934 stands alone right now in the world in terms of power
7881935 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7881936 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7881937 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7881938 hes really good there he always runs up front were taking a car and engine package that we plan on running at the daytona 500 next year in february and we couldnt think of a better guy to take and put in the car
7881939 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7881940 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7881941 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7881942 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7881943 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7881944 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7881945 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7881946 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7881947 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7881948 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7881949 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7881950 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7881951 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7881952 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7881953 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7881954 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7881955 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7881956 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7881957 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7881958 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7881959 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7881960 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7881961 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7881962 i was never going to be a quarterback on the football team or the starting pitcher on a baseball team but i found that i could find myself through playing the piano
7881963 am i destined to watch only okies movies this week
7881964 heresy is like a tree its roots lie in the darkness whilst its leaves wave in the sun and to those who suspect nought it has an attractive and pleasing appearance
7881965 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
7881966 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
7881967 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
7881968 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
7881969 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
7881970 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
7881971 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
7881972 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
7881973 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
7881974 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
7881975 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
7881976 no one works for someone we all just work together
7881977 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
7881978 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7881979 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7881980 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
7881981 it could be good for the nation if other corporate companies could emulate what standard bank has done to work with undp on an issue that is of national and global concern
7881982 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7881983 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7881984 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7881985 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7881986 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7881987 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7881988 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7881989 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7881990 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7881991 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7881992 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7881993 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7881994 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7881995 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
7881996 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
7881997 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
7881998 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7881999 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7882000 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7882001 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7882002 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7882003 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7882004 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7882005 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7882006 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7882007 virtually all conventional pin tumbler locks are vulnerable to this method of attack and frankly nobody has really considered it or looked at it before amtrak cant handle increasing ridership its what could be considered a best of times worst of times scenario for amtrak rising fuel costs mean that amtrak ridership is steadily increasing yet amtrak cant keep up after decades of slashed budgets and neglect actually it sounds downright dismal if amtrak doesnt get needed funding according to amtrak ceo alex kummaut itll take upwards of a decade and 3 billion to replace amtraks current rolling stock including the 20 acela trains yet later on in the article he dismisses out of hand the idea of creating high speed rail depressing a teleconference was held today at jpl to discuss the recent intermediate findings by the phoenix mars landers science team of perchlorate on mars jpl has posted the jpls podcast feed to keep up to date on the science as it evolves what does it all mean though well not much the science team seems pretty confident the perchlorate wasnt from contamination of phoenixs instruments by the third stage rocket booster but its still an intermediate result and needs to be confirmed perchlorate doesnt mean mars couldnt support life but it would be different from the way everyone was looking at it before for instance in the atacama desert of chile organic matter and microorganisms coexist with perchlorate for more about the phoenix mars lander please read our exclusive interview with phoenix free membership to the american humanist association free trial online only membership
7882008 oh and you can help swell the ranks of one of the finest secular organizations out there as well as being able to proudly tell everyone that you belong to a national humanist association thanks to phil plait new president of jref
7882009 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7882010 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7882011 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7882012 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7882013 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7882014 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7882015 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7882016 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7882017 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest

7882037 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations

7882039 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7882040 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7882041 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7882042 there may be parts of the speech that arent going to get a lot of applause but ive got to say what i believe will get out country back on the right path
7882043 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7882044 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7882045 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7882046 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7882047 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7882048 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7882049 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president
7882050 were talking about the nominee for the president of the united states
7882051 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7882052 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7882053 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7882054 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7882055 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place

7882058 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7882059 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7882060 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7882061 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7882062 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7882063 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7882064 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7882065 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7882066 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7882067 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon

7882069 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7882070 in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed their positions somewhat closer together over this period of time
7882071 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7882072 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7882073 which still continue and which without a doubt are the main obstacle in the political process
7882074 just because we have not yet succeeded does not mean we have failed
7882075 i would like to suggest to my partners not to use it as an excuse and i know they are not using it as an excuse but i understand their frustration sometimes
7882076 there were some small activities but they will not influence the ability to negotiate nor the future of the future borders of the palestinian state
7882077 in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and that anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided
7882078 and we will continue to press ahead to get agreement so that we know what is in
7882079 then you will see the dangers of this kind of labeling
7882080 people live in close communion with nature unaware of and unaffected by the shrill political theatre around them
7882081 the poverty of our century is unlike that of any other it is not as poverty was before the result of natural scarcity but of a set of priorities imposed on the rest of the world by the rich consequently the modern poor are not pitied but written off as trash the twentieth century consumer economy has produced the first culture in which the beggar is a reminder of nothing
7882082 anthropologists including graduate and undergraduate students i also hope it will be read by scholars students and designers in fields like game studies informatics and science and technology studies another hoped for readership includes persons who participate in virtual worlds or online games
7882083 by early 2007 there was one petabyte a million gigabytes of data in sl at that point were all the books in the library of congress digitised about 30 million volumes it would have been equivalent to only about 2 percent of the data stored inside sl

7882085 since mr zarchuk had no blood relatives in america the willard superintendant authorized the procedure questions of competency and informed consent were never raised electroshock was quite popular in american institutions of the time but was it reasonable to administer shock to a patient like zarchuk even according to the rather loose standards of the day probably not

7882088 alterations of external props are ceteris paribus ethically on a par with alternations of the brain to the precise extent to which our reasons for finding alterations of the brain problematic are transferable to alterations of the environment in which it is embedded
7882089 we ought to view such behavior as a type of
7882090 hysterics act disabled and sick their illness is not real but an imitation of a bodily illness by means of body language hysterics communicate with themselves and others especially those willing perhaps even eager to assume the role of protecting and controlling them
7882091 suffering from the consequences of having lived a life very badly very stupidly very evilly that from the time of her teens for reasons which i dont know she had whatever she had done she has done very badly she was a bad student there is no evidence that she was a particularly good daughter sister she was a bad wife she was a bad mother she was a bad employee insofar as she was employable then she started to engage in taking illegal drugs then she escalated to illegal assault and finally she committed this murder life is a task you either cope with it or it gets you if you do not know how to build you can always destroy these are the people that destroy us in society our society and other people
7882092 our skittishness about suicide and our longing for good doctors to kill us at just the right time and in just the right way but more fundamentally with our repudiation of bodily self ownership and the responsibilities that go with it
7882093 the schiavo drama was a classic battle of words he who controlled the vocabulary controlled the debate and was assured of victory
7882094 terri schiavo was killed b ecause no one not her husband not her parents not any philanthropist not the american taxpayer was willing to pay to keep her alive if we believe that executing innocent people is wrong then the schiavo case presents no ethical problem it presents economic political and social problems
7882095 in short the legal definition of pas as a procedure that only a physician can perform expands the medicalization of everyday life extends medical control over personal conduct especially at the end of life and diminishes patient autonomy
7882096 why do i consider his views which i think are mistaken and wicked in this volume
7882097 by physicians acting explicitly or implicitly wittingly or unwittingly as agents of the state

7882099 the answer to the question of whether a person has a
7882100 americans want a therapist in chief who is both physician and priest an authority that will protect them from having to assume responsibility not only for their own health but also for their behaviors that make them ill literally or figuratively
7882101 by the time they discover that the therapeutic state is about tyranny not therapy it will be too late
7882102 not medical but human that is moral social political problems we cannot solve them by therapeutic means hence we must stop continuing and even intensifying our efforts to solve them by such means
7882103 since the vocabulary of psychiatry serves to systematically redefine moral and political problems as diseases we must repudiate and stop this abuse of our language
7882104 why why me why are you so good to me
7882105 do not sacrifice personal or childrens well being or safety for the preservation of the relationship

7882114 i have repeatedly said that under certain conditions it would be blameworthy not to forgive which implies that it forgiveness may indeed be morally demanded and that forgivingness is a praiseworthy virtue i have certainly implied as well that it would be blameworthy not to seek forgiveness by taking the appropriate steps the expression of forgivingness is not elective in the sense that one can arbitrarily decide without blame to withhold it under the appropriate conditions the victim has reasons for committing to forgive or not to forgive or not would be what a good or virtuous person would do

7882119 taking seriously our responsibility to others thus also constitutes the very notion of our identities
7882120 we need to learn the lesson that we should foster the conditions in which theories are open to continual scrutiny and subject to revision

7882122 feminists need to take responsibility for their own histories and concepts without finding new targets of discrimination on which to project our own fears limitations inadequacies and blindspots
7882123 we came all the way from chicago like somebody else you know
7882124 i love you i trust you and im not afraid of you you can sleep on the same bed dont behave like a stranger with me
7882125 now shes yours take care of her dont ever make me regret what i just did
7882126 everything will be ok u sure u want to spend the rest of your life with me
7882127 i am appealing to anyone who believes they saw the woman in the greenleys area to contact me
7882128 errmmmm this might sound crazy but the thing is ive got this huge crush on you and i just wanted you to know
7882129 we have 130 000 people on our waiting list we could charge anything and still fill the stadium
7882130 they said if you dont voluntarily give up the dogs we will arrest you and put you in jail and charge a fine for each dog here
7882131 i equate this to living in one room of my house for all of my life and somebody just dropping groceries by once a week not a lot of stimulation
7882132 this is not what dogs were put on this planet for
7882133 how can you raise dogs without worming them and vaccinating them trimming their toenails and grooming them
7882134 we petted them and played with them and held them
7882135 they rode around on a golf cart with us they were very well socialized
7882136 some of them you put them on the ground and they dont know what it is because theyve lived their entire life on wire mesh
7882137 all the dogs had food and water in front of them at all times
7882138 you have to understand in an environment with four or five in a kennel theyre competing for food
7882139 you simply cant describe the overwhelming smell of the ammonia the feces
7882140 and these were kept decently clean but still the smell was just horrible
7882141 she was trying to care for the animals the best way she could but it was just impossible to care for that many dogs properly with the staff that the kennel had
7882142 these dogs have never been outside of that environment everything is new to them
7882143 they come to you with these bright eyes saying thank you
7882144 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7882145 i wanted to tell you something for quite some days now
7882146 mmmmm i but never thought you i already were good friends
7882147 we can categorically state that we have not released man eating badgers into the area
7882148 all i can tell you is its always about the money
7882149 for their use of the material originating in the broadway production
7882150 no doubt the deliberately ambiguous language of the settlement will be quoted by the very people who authored it to prove that there remains some confusion or uncertainty around the issue of a directors copyright
7882151 thats a detail dictated by the material what were concerned with is the totality of the work where its using a majority portion of the staging
7882152 if you dont want to pay and license the original staging just dont do the original staging create your own
7882153 the amount of money choreographers and directors get for this kind of license is minute given the cost of these productions that moneys not going to make a dent even at a regional theater we were depicted as the big bad broadway people thats not the truth the important thing about these settlements is the acknowledgment that the work of the original creators was used and that whats created is the property of the person who created it

7882160 if you ask me what is the most essential element in the teaching and morality of jesus christ i would answer you the first is humility the second is humility and the third is humility
7882161 if you ever are going through a rough time and your soul is filled with uneasiness it is because you are thinking too much about yourself
7882162 it is because life on earth does not go the way we had hoped or because obstacles arise which prevent us from satisfying our personal ambitions
7882163 prayer is the humility of the man who acknowledges his profound wretchedness and the greatness of god
7882164 all those setbacks that so often made us suffer have never caused us to lose our joy and peace
7882165 the word is commonly used in a derogatory manner against people of the muslim faith or arab origin we have no desire to inhibit the creative process or your right to produce any film you wish however i ask you to take the above concerns into consideration and examine the social implications of releasing the film under its current title it is unfortunate that a major film studio would choose to exploit an ethnic slur as a sensational promotion for a movie mainstreaming a bigoted term in this manner will only serve to legitimize and normalize anti muslim prejudice in our society
7882166 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7882167 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7882168 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7882169 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes

7882173 i think that whether you are muslim buddhist christian hindu or atheist you have to be able to bear insults you cant say im a muslim and that means i should be above criticism you can freely insult jesus christ you can mock other religions
7882174 deep in the mentality of danish people that we will not tolerate people saying you cant say or publish that there is a growing awareness in denmark that we have to keep it the bastion of free speech that it has been for many years
7882175 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7882176 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7882177 all id have to do is give them a disc
7882178 once you put on songs as hold music youre a broadcaster
7882179 i admit that you have been hurt and i apologise for that
7882180 i regret that we have failed in the democratic journey we started with my late wife benazir bhutto and nawaz sharif we had some successes together we elected a prime minister and defeated a dictator
7882181 in the interest of democracy and while announcing his decision to pull out of the coalition sharif had accused zardari of violating several agreements on reinstating dozens of judges who were sacked by former president pervez musharraf during last years
7882182 may be less than legal for them to exchange hands that way
7882183 i know i am not the only one wheeling and dealing these things though
7882184 we have recently commenced proceedings against parties involved in the production and distribution of a movie entitled hari puttar
7882185 warner bros values and protects intellectual property rights however it is our policy not to discuss publicly the details of any ongoing litigation
7882186 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7882187 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7882188 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7882189 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7882190 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7882191 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7882192 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7882193 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7882194 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7882195 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7882196 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7882197 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7882198 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7882199 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7882200 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7882201 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7882202 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7882203 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7882204 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7882205 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7882206 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7882207 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7882208 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7882209 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today

7882228 its coincided a little bit with age too you get to a point where your responsibilities and priorities become a bit clearer and thats been a big thing for me
7882229 anyone thats up to speed on the dynamics of the trade that went through would know i didnt have a whole heap of say in what went on
7882230 if people bear that in mind theyll go easy on me but i wouldnt want to be sitting next to my mum if they do boo they could end up with a lap full of chips
7882231 i love the big crowds too so luckily at collingwood we get to play in front of them every week
7882232 our forward line has taken a bit of a whack without anthony and alan down there so if he thomas can get up it will be great
7882233 with a young group hes really the one we look to not only because hes our captain but because hes our most in and under player and thats going to be important against fremantle
7882234 hes been important the last three weeks and hes really important on the weekend
7882235 anything can happen and weve shown that the last three weeks
7882236 i dont think many people gave us a chance against st kilda as the weeks have gone on our confidence has grown
7882237 if someone said a couple of years ago youre going to win a best and fairest or be in the mix i would have thought id made the transition back to wafl footy pretty well
7882238 mit seiner langj hrigen erfahrung ist er der richtige mann um das wachstum von avaya im channel voranzutreiben
7882239 das neue vertriebsmodell sieht vor channel und direktvertrieb eng miteinander zu verzahnen
7882240 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7882241 it was just the dynamics in that particular campaign that they happened to face
7882242 sometimes theres just a big element of luck in life
7882243 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend
7882244 i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support for united states foreign policy
7882245 will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7882246 he selected lieberman and the two men not selected in 2000 wound up being our national ticket in 2004
7882247 so for evan bayh getting this far in this process points to only bigger and better things to come in the future in my view
7882248 dear i finished second or third in a contest where they dont give bronze or silver medals
7882249 a hoosier was considered so seriously for such an important post
7882250 i welcomed that and i came through in fine shape
7882251 and then they showed pictures of me in the kitchen making breakfast
7882252 senator biden was kind enough to say youve got a lot of years ahead of you and this could happen next time for you
7882253 i suspect obama might well have preferred bayh as his vice president in office but opted for the person he thought most likely to help in the campaign
7882254 bayhs future continues to be bright in the senate or in an obama administration
7882255 certainly has more to do with joe biden than evan bayh
7882256 hes still young by presidential campaign standards and hes got a great record and profile
7882257 i think that this process here more than in 2000 and 2004 exposed the rest of the nation to how great a leader he is in the democratic party and all the great assets he brings
7882258 we now know that barack obama doesnt truly respect hoosiers
7882259 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7882260 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7882261 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7882262 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7882263 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7882264 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7882265 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7882266 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7882267 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7882268 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7882269 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7882270 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7882271 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7882272 if they dont strip me then i dont care what they do
7882273 all that is required for the triumph of snappy borax is that weird men do nothing
7882274 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7882275 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7882276 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7882277 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7882278 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7882279 working for nycs youngest child care at a turning point

7882281 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7882282 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7882283 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7882284 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7882285 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7882286 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7882287 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7882288 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7882289 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7882290 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7882291 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7882292 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7882293 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7882294 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7882295 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7882296 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7882297 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7882298 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7882299 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7882300 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7882301 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7882302 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7882303 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7882304 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7882305 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7882306 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7882307 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7882308 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7882309 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7882310 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7882311 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7882312 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7882313 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7882314 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7882315 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7882316 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure

7882319 serious baseball at least not the way barack obama sees it
7882320 im not one of these fair weather fans the junior senator from illinois and presumptive presidential nominee of the democratic party explained
7882321 you go to wrigley field you have a beer beautiful people up there people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball southside
7882322 everyone knows that true baseball fans are at comiskey not at wrigley field
7882323 lets see the cubs have john cusack as their fan and the sox have the soon to be most powerful man on earth as their fan
7882324 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7882325 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7882326 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7882327 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7882328 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7882329 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7882330 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7882331 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7882332 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7882333 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7882334 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7882335 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7882336 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7882337 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7882338 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7882339 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7882340 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7882341 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7882342 of particular note was the groups ability to manage its expenses which grew at an inflation beating seven percent
7882343 were the highest for the month of june since 2003
7882344 a large number of officers are working on this inquiry and as part of the investigation the car park was sealed off until about lunchtime yesterday
7882345 more than 50 percent of your parliamentarians dont give a damn about taxpayers money
7882346 this is history repeating itself this is basically politicians who are drunk with power
7882347 most of the libertarians who have come before me have fought for the right to withhold tax i wonder if thats where weve come to because that is the only clear message we can send to our government
7882348 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7882349 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7882350 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

7882353 while the use of the alt tag is obviously helpful in optimizing for google search the dimensions width and height are also important because google image search also lets users search for images according to size in the advanced options this means defining your image size makes it easier for google to crawl and index your site and subsequently store information about your graphics
7882354 how idiot are you by telling her that class is started in fact that you are 15 minutes early
7882355 what i am saying is that we have actually met the legal requirements all the time
7882356 it is self evident that employees will be exposed the more important issue is whether that exposure is harmful
7882357 we say you are in gross violation of the law we are here to show that you are in contempt of the law
7882358 well i know i kept all my books but let me whip them out after 4 years or so to find that answer to that cause i carry them with me where ever i go specifically for the shop talk that occurs at night after the papa gets home and i dont even live here im just here visiting lol
7882359 i was down in the dumps and feeling sorry for myself
7882360 and my friends told me cheer up things could be worse so i cheered up and sure enough things got worse
7882361 we read in the papers how farmers are doing well with high commodity prices
7882362 if they could look at our bills for fertilizer fuel seed chemicals labor and other costs theyd see a different story were struggling just like everyone else
7882363 i can reasonably cope with 4 diesel and 750 nitrogen when corn prices are 6 or better
7882364 but i cant do it if corn drops back to 3 and input costs stay where they are or go higher because it was so dry i had to make 10 circles with a pivot on one corn field that took 5 000 gallons of diesel it takes high corn prices to offset these costs
7882365 i was down in the dumps and feeling sorry for myself
7882366 and my friends told me cheer up things could be worse
7882367 the times are very very difficult for our catfish farmers theyre being severely challenged
7882368 due to higher operating costs farmers are losing money on the fish they grow bottom line is the farmers must make a profit and to do that requires stabilization of feed costs and the prices received for catfish must be higher
7882369 federal feed assistance is needed whether for catfish or beef poultry dairy or pork in essence a feeding fuel surcharge has been added with this escalation of the oil price
7882370 our congressional leadership understands we must have food and fuel you cant hold one hostage for the other
7882371 in my opinion there must be some federal assistance for all protein producers feed has never been this expensive
7882372 are tied together you must have feed that is affordable and efficient to maximize conversion but we also have seen diesel and electrical rates escalating
7882373 our farmers are struggling but the u s farm raised catfish industry is not dead we do recognize some producers will exit but others are committed to the future and if theyre going to commit they have to make a profit
7882374 we do know that catfish production is declining but at this time its difficult to say just how much a lot of people are making decisions today that will affect their farms for the next five or 10 years
7882375 stabilization is the key for all of them theyre all confused and asking where is this record crude price taking us will there be a federal food policy will these inferior and illegal imports continue to come in
7882376 we know our industry will be smaller but it wont disappear the resiliency of our catfish farmers is strong and they will prevail
7882377 if you think about it there is no aquaculture industry in the united states that even comes close to what the catfish industry has accomplished not trout not salmon not tilapia
7882378 two things are dependent on this industry the catfish farmer himself and the catfish consumer i believe that partnership is stronger than any other in agriculture thats been our key to success in the past and our key to success in the future
7882379 demand remains strong sales are up 13 percent for the year and 21 percent for june weve just got to get the price and on farm profitability in line because we have a consumer that is very very loyal
7882380 right now it is between 80 and 85 cents per pound when you go to the grocery store and see that everything else has increased 30 40 or 50 percent you realize that our farmers need to receive 15 to 20 percent more for their product now
7882381 the hardest part of increasing the price is it has to happen across the board all processors have to bear the same burden of raising prices
7882382 we get calls all the time from people that love to eat catfish saying we know things are tough and hear a lot of horror stories retail catfish prices should just go up consumers will still buy u s farm raised catfish
7882383 however when you consider catfish there are many substitutes available there are all the imported products all the ocean catches
7882384 but u s farm raised catfish is sustainable better for the environment and healthier in many ways there are legitimate barriers to moving the price up but i do believe the price should go up so that our farmers are making a profit
7882385 im definitely in favor of anything that will offer unity for our farmers so we can ensure the future of our farmers you either pay farmers what their product is worth or you wont have any more farmers
7882386 mississippi passed cool legislation unanimously in both house and senate and every committee
7882387 we do know there was legislation on call some didnt get called up some didnt pass in georgia alabama and louisiana texas has already contacted us about what was done in mississippi arkansas already has a bill that requires cool labeling for restaurants
7882388 but the mississippi cool law is a model for other states in our industry 70 percent of product is sold in restaurants thats why the legislation was so vital
7882389 only 30 percent is sold in grocery stores but that product is already covered under a federal cool law for fish and seafood
7882390 we know that safety was the driving force behind the law we know that imported fish contains dangerous illegal chemicals we know that fda inspects only 1 to 2 percent of the food entering the united states we know that 52 shipments were rejected in 2007
7882391 tci commissioned a national survey and 96 percent of the catfish consumers across the country preferred u s farm raised catfish by displaying signs in mississippi restaurants it ensures restaurant patrons are receiving the highest quality product that can be served
7882392 the cool legislation doesnt prohibit anyone from selling imported catfish they just must label it on their menu in the font size of the other menu selections
7882393 tci offers free of charge certificates saying we proudly serve u s farm raised catfish there are 1 500 catfish restaurants that have already received signage in mississippi and there are many more going out
7882394 whether its mississippi or any other state there should be no doubt about the product youre being served and that your family is consuming
7882395 one of the more important things were doing is aggressively looking at a name change for catfish in white table cloth restaurants tci has commissioned many focus groups across the country and many consumers wont even try catfish because of the name
7882396 we have placed delacata in five upscale restaurants across the country and it has been an overwhelming success
7882397 were now looking at ways to differentiate that product at the farm level so the farmer and processor can be ensured a better return on their investment
7882398 our product will always be called catfish in catfish areas delacata is almost like black angus beef there will some different standards for delacata just like there are for black angus
7882399 weve commissioned a consulting group turover straus that works entirely in food theyve done similar things before a group from their company visited the delta last week theyve been on farms have been in stoneville and have been to processing plants
7882400 theyre developing a blueprint to have distinction between delacata and catfish
7882401 delacata will be the filet mignon of catfish were not trying to hide the fact its u s farm raised catfish but its an enhanced version we feel all the technology and infrastructure is in place to capitalize on this
7882402 our partnership with viking range corp has led to this weve been working with viking on developing delacata for three years
7882403 everything were doing going forward will be aggressive marketing not passive were working with a restaurant chain bass pro shops to have a catfish promotion were going to use that as a model for additional restaurant chains in the future
7882404 its also important to talk about a processor partnership where we offer them opportunities through point of sales materials recipe booklets some cost sharing on marketing
7882405 our celebrity spokesperson is cat cora the food networks first female iron chef there will be print ads with her and three of the catfish farmers of the year
7882406 weve been working in canada for about eight years right now its a very interesting time to be selling there the devaluation of the u s dollar is opening up opportunities
7882407 next year the supply of fish will be extremely tight well have a trade delegation of processors going to canada in late october to meet with buyers in the retail sector in both toronto and montreal some processors are already selling into canada but there is opportunity for others
7882408 the first presidential debate will be in oxford miss on sept 26 catfish will be one of the three or four featured foods in the grove there will be around 4 000 people eating most journalists from around the world well be there center stage with u s farm raised catfish
7882409 this came about due to a partnership with the southern food alliance which is based in oxford
7882410 there are a lot of things that are happening for this industry even though farmers are in a plight tci is working non stop on things that will pay dividends
7882411 cfa was instrumental with the new farm bill in having inspection moved from the department of commerce to usda that broke new ground
7882412 aquaculture is agriculture and theres no better place to have our industry than with usda theres no more recognizable seal than usda grade a our product will now have the opportunity to be stamped with that seal which symbolizes quality
7882413 times are difficult but so many positive things are happening that will prove beneficial for farmers that stay in catfish the industry is not going away
7882414 i was down in the dumps and feeling sorry for myself
7882415 and my friends told me cheer up things could be worse
7882416 i was down in the dumps and feeling sorry for myself
7882417 and my friends told me cheer up things could be worse
7882418 it was clear that the chinese dont want anyone climbing in tibet this season or for a number of years to follow the situation in the area is not good
7882419 with the beijing olympics happening this week reports are very mixed however im not going to get political
7882420 the frustration of not knowing whether we would be leaving for cho oyu has made the motivation to keep training incredibly hard
7882421 but youve got to move forward and thats what ive already done within three days of the news i was focusing on another mountain in a slightly more stable region
7882422 its slightly lower than cho oyu but a significantly higher grade challenge the route follows a steep ridge over very exposed ground
7882423 i wanted to climb higher than i have ever done before experience how my body would react to altitude after cancer treatment to prove that you can push your body to the limits and above all come back in one piece
7882424 with the close support of many behind me the experience has been fantastic even now
7882425 ive missed plenty of nights in the pub but im sure it will be worth it in the end
7882426 in the current situation of high commodity prices and low stocks we have been saying that we have the science to help address this incredible demand for agricultural commodities
7882427 im very excited to announce today that we will deliver a step change improvement in soybean yields in unprecedented volumes for the 2009 growing season
7882428 with the y series yield advantage this new line has the potential to add about 19 million bushels of soybeans into u s production
7882429 one of the most important traits to a grower when selecting new products for their farm is yield and higher yields have never been more important to the ag economy and to the world than they are today
7882430 the entire y series class has shown a 5 percent yield advantage over key competitors in more than 1 800 on farm comparisons with some of them yielding as much as 10 percent better than these key competitors
7882431 pioneer has been a leader in the use of molecular technology since the mid 1990s
7882432 historically weve developed molecular markers for traits such as resistance to soybean cyst nematode phytophthora root rot and brown stem rot
7882433 but one of the new breakthroughs in recent years is developing molecular markers that actually track genes that can enhance yield performance per se unlike genes for pest resistance that are controlled by one or two genes yield is controlled by many genes working in combination so its difficult to do it by just looking at yield data and determining which gene is causing yield enhancement
7882434 after we ran the analysis comparing the current elite varieties with their ancestors we wound up with a little over 100 genes that we focused on as potential yield enhancers then we started testing those genes one by one to see if they had yield enhancing properties
7882435 we have a goal at pioneer of increasing soybean productivity by nearly 40 percent over the next 10 years to meet the growing demand for soybeans used for food for feed and for fuel
7882436 its always important to review the lake districts tourism product for all sectors of the market to meet changing demands and expectations
7882437 the meeting was a great opportunity to ensure that we can carefully consider how the lake district retains its position as one of the top destinations in the uk for japanese visitors
7882438 the lake district japan forum has once again proved that the lake district tourist industry can compete at the highest level in a global market place and is widely respected for its very close co operation and work with the japanese travel trade
7882439 we will now be seeking support from other commercial members of cumbria tourism to develop products in line with the discussions we had

7882777 im not going to lie it still bothers me very much
7882778 i was very unhappy with the deep referee and the way he officiated our first bout they constantly stood me up from dominant positions on the ground and tried to make it as difficult as possible to beat chonan i feel i completely dominated the first two rounds and the cut stoppage with two minutes left in the third round was bulls t i am glad our rematch will be in the ufc and im looking forward to having a fair fight
7882779 i was really disappointed when i found out he was injured and couldnt fight me at ufc 85
7882780 but i understand that this is a fight business and people do get hurt

7882789 honestly the food and culture are totally different but i have grown to love it
7882790 i miss my family and friends the most though its hard not being able to see them whenever i want

7882817 i think the really amazing thing is that hunters and herdsmen and farmers didnt notice it
7882818 we just stopped looking on camping people and started to look on cows
7882819 most of them actually align in a north south direction
7882820 its a very clever use of google earth and the evidence is quite compelling it does seem that these animals are detecting the earths magnetic field and using it to point in a north south direction
7882821 i was really amazed at the consistency with which they found north facing cows and deer it was really intriguing
7882822 it was very imaginative it demonstrates yet again all the unexpected uses of and value of digital geospatial data
7882823 start going out and putting magnets on the heads of cows and horses and deer to see how that affects them
7882824 thats one of the more traditional ways of testing if they have a magnetic sense
7882825 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7882826 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7882827 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7882828 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7882829 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7882830 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7882831 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7882832 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days

7882835 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7882836 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical

7882855 it implies that a lot of what we consider subjectively to be part of the human experience are local phenomena independent of the essential
7882856 egnors analogy distinguishes between the externally generated signal the voice on the phone and locally generated noise pops clicks hisses etc but where it fails is in recognizing that that even within his soul transmitter brain receiver model a lot of the locally generated phenomena are essential parts of what we consider to be us this is not a reassuring picture of souls and life after death it would have to be an afterlife in which were stripped of our memories and our personalities and our sensations that isnt an objection in principle of course its only a recognition that egnors idea has implications hes ignoring
7882857 heres the deal i cant disprove that no one can
7882858 its not my fault your wife became a vegetable after i operated on her brain her brain and who she is are unrelated dont sue
7882859 hi my names mabel smith and im calling from portland oregon
7882860 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7882861 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7882862 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7882863 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7882867 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7882868 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7882869 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7882870 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7882871 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7882872 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7882873 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7882874 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7882875 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7882876 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7882877 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7882878 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7882879 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7882880 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7882881 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7882882 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7882883 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7882884 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7882885 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7882886 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7882887 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7882888 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7882889 hey that guy might be a short singaporean but hes chill
7882890 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7882891 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7882892 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7882893 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7882894 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7882895 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

7882903 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7882904 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7882905 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7882906 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7882907 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7882908 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7882909 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7882910 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7882911 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7882912 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7882913 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7882914 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7882915 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7882916 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

7882921 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7882922 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7882923 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7882924 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7882925 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7882926 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7882927 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7882935 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level

7883038 schwarzenegger speaking of the states two month budget standoff told the bee that lawmakers are so afraid of political fallout that they cant step over their own shadow
7883039 everyone is kind of frightened to make any move he said
7883040 the governor said he is trying to act as the grown up in the budget negotiations
7883041 by taking the fight directly to voters however strategists for both parties said schwarzenegger could antagonize the very lawmakers he needs to strike a deal
7883042 the problem with using that kind of bullying language is that hes tried it in the past and it didnt work said democratic political consultant

7883045 sunday was supposed to have been the drop dead day for passing a reform measure in time for the november ballot schwarzenegger said he might call a special election next year

7883047 the governor chided republicans for not producing their own budget he has democrats have
7883048 republicans talk about the borrowing scenario and about the cuts he said id like to see their budget why havent we seen any numbers wouldnt it be wonderful here are the cuts in education and in healthcare and in prisons and law enforcement

7883054 we know people are going to drive we want them in their cars for less time said state sen

7883138 on the matter of muslims being sheep shaggers this was not my assertion but that of the late ayatollah khomeini on the important question of whether one may eat post coitally ones sexual partner a man who has had sexual relations with an animal such as a sheep may not eat its meat he would commit sin good to have that cleared up

7883272 it is the same situation we are working hard on trying to improve the squad if possible
7883273 we have a better squad and we were starting to play really well at the end of pre season
7883274 then we started playing bad but the only positive thing is that we are winning
7883275 it is really good if you can win without playing well because it means that when you start to play well it will be easier
7883276 i am confident we will improve and if it is like this i am sure we will continue winning

7883280 every time we make the decision to love someone we open ourselves to great suffering because those we most love cause us not only great joy but also great pain the greatest pain comes from leaving when the child leaves home when the husband or wife leaves for a long period of time or for good when the beloved friend departs to another country or dies the pain of the leaving can tear us apart still if we want to avoid the suffering of leaving we will never experience the joy of loving and love is stronger than fear life stronger than death hope stronger than despair we have to trust that the risk of loving is always worth taking
7883281 and love is stronger than fear life stronger than death hope stronger than despair
7883282 if fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction
7883283 rapidly becoming more irritating than the overuse of the word row
7883284 it all begins in the home who is raising these animals
7883285 first in the whole of southeast asia and for that matter the first developing country to commit to the phase out of mercury in its healthcare system
7883286 we realized that we had to coordinate with partner agencies given the scope of the proposed ao the health department will need the assistance of the department of trade and industry dti in giving accreditation for alternative products based on the criteria that the bureau of health facilities development will provide
7883287 the costs may be high in the short term but may be lower in the long term
7883288 the non mercury clinical thermometer digital type is almost four times more expensive than the mercury type but its worth considering the cost of materials needed for clean up and disposal of mercury spill in the event of accidental breakage
7883289 it all begins in the home who is raising these animals
7883290 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7883291 looking back at it i dont want to say yes but i dont want to say no
7883292 they cannot last a day longer if we as zimbabweans speak against them in deafening unison
7883293 it is anwar versus the entire government god willing i am confident of winning
7883294 it was his home ground so that was always an advantage because he has a lot of support there
7883295 we expected him to win this just proves there is nothing wrong with our electoral system but i still doubt he will be able to pull off his sept 16 threat
7883296 it is a lie to smear him the government is doing everything they can to shame him
7883297 anwars victory will bring good reforms to our country and will unite all the races in malaysia

7883313 at least 16 iraqis were killed and 14 more were wounded in the latest round of violence one u s soldier was killed in a small arms attack in baghdad
7883314 life in iraq is still hard despite the slight improvement in security there is a big deficiency in services in all areas and even in the nice neighborhoods this deficiency is the fault of the government and concerned circles which cannot fulfill their duties because of endemic fraud
7883315 i hope there wont be a fence here too long
7883316 se fue con una persona no s con qui n no fue v ctima de ning n delito

7883319 nach den letzten paar rennen und beim test in br nn habe ich ein besseres setup gefunden insofern glaube ich dass wir den fans beim heimspiel des teams ein tolles spektakel liefern werden
7883320 marco war in br nn in der zweiten rennh lfte sehr stark daher sind wir optimistisch dass er in misano gut abschneiden wird es ist ein besonderes rennen f r ihn
7883321 ich wurde ein paar kilometer von misano entfernt geboren und f hle mich auf der strecke wirklich zu hause der kurs ist noch neu f r uns dieses jahr haben sie die erste kurve wieder ver ndert es hat viele langsame kurven und das berholen ist nicht einfach daher kommt es mehr denn je auf ein gutes qualifying und auf einen guten start an

7883324 but we feel that both sides are serious about solving the pending issues that are being discussed foremost is determination of the june 4 1967 line
7883325 the future relations between france and syria highly depends on the nature of lebanese syrian ties
7883326 we feel that the two sides are serious about solving the lingering issues that are being discussed foremost is determination of the june 4 1967 line
7883327 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7883328 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7883329 no security agreement between the united states and iraq without an unconditional timetable for withdrawal
7883330 there is an agreement actually reached reached between the two parties on a fixed date which is the end of 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7883331 it has emboldened syria hezbollah and iran to push harder against israel and the u s in an attempt to capitalize on recent setbacks in the balkans lebanon and afghanistan
7883332 but only on the condition that they lease it for 20 years just to make sure that theyre serious
7883333 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur

7883337 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level
7883338 they said if you dont voluntarily give up the dogs we will arrest you and put you in jail and charge a fine for each dog here
7883339 i equate this to living in one room of my house for all of my life and somebody just dropping groceries by once a week not a lot of stimulation
7883340 this is not what dogs were put on this planet for
7883341 how can you raise dogs without worming them and vaccinating them trimming their toenails and grooming them
7883342 we petted them and played with them and held them
7883343 they rode around on a golf cart with us they were very well socialized
7883344 some of them you put them on the ground and they dont know what it is because theyve lived their entire life on wire mesh
7883345 all the dogs had food and water in front of them at all times
7883346 you have to understand in an environment with four or five in a kennel theyre competing for food
7883347 you simply cant describe the overwhelming smell of the ammonia the feces
7883348 and these were kept decently clean but still the smell was just horrible
7883349 she was trying to care for the animals the best way she could but it was just impossible to care for that many dogs properly with the staff that the kennel had
7883350 these dogs have never been outside of that environment everything is new to them
7883351 they come to you with these bright eyes saying thank you
7883352 most organizations that struggle with shifting priorities do so because thinking ahead is difficult

7883363 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
7883364 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
7883365 discussions on the devolution of policing and justice have progressed well in the preparation for government committee the governments have requested the parties to continue these discussions so as to agree the necessary administrative arrangements to create a new policing and justice department it is our view i e the view of the two governments that the implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary for the assembly to request the devolution of criminal justice and policing from the british government by may 2008
7883366 there is no definitive date for the devolution of policing and justice powers we remain of the unshakable view that those powers can only be transferred whenever there is the required community confidence
7883367 every four or eight years ireland is forced to rally round young men from this class
7883368 every four or eight years ireland is forced to rally round young men from this class and adopt them as our great national hopes
7883369 this charge of fiddling while rome burns was a problem which heaney discusses in his essay the interesting case of nero chekhovs cognac and a knocker where he recalls how he and david hammond felt unable to record a tape of songs against the immediate backdrop of explosions in belfast
7883370 we aimed to challenge sectarian divisions in the north of ireland to put
7883371 davy is in that well worn phrase a man of many parts but the whole is greater than the sum of the parts and the uniqueness of david hammond is his midas touch the way he can discern art and poetry in the commonplace and above all the way in which he effortlessly explores i would almost say creates a common ground on which irishmen and women of every tradition and disposition no matter how cantankerous or self regarding we may be in other areas can meet each other and re discover a vital part of ourselves in all of this his wife eileen has played a quiet but essential part their home in belfast has for years been a magnet for cultural waifs and strays of every description an embassy of song its warmth and hospitality a standing rebuke to the image of the dour wee north that is most prevalent among people who have never crossed the border
7883372 the singers house by seamus heaney to david hammond people here used to believe that drowned souls lived in seals at spring tides they might change shape they loved music and swam in for a singer who might stand at the end of summer in the mouth of a whitewashed turf shed his shoulder to the jamb his song a rowboat far out in evening when i came here first you were always singing a hint of the clip of the pick in your winnowing climb and attack raise it again man we still believe what we hear
7883373 its very clear we need to deliver any agreements that weve had with the dup and the two governments the devolution of policing and justice has to happen we in our party have worked for years and are very committed to the process under way but we need to start seeing results
7883374 the oireachtas could ratify lisbon subject to a number of opt outs if necessary for example the charter of fundamental rights the solidarity clause transfer of certain matters to qualified majority voting and the inclusion of new competences such as energy security climate change and tourism
7883375 mep mary lou mcdonald has said if the irish government secures a better deal for ireland at european level only then is there an argument for a new referendum those of us on the no side want specific new additional points in the treaty and we want specific cast iron legal views on taxation she said
7883376 a succession of anti family anti life and other anti christian decisions by brussels has made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive support for europe in the lisbon referendum
7883377 concerns were expressed regarding abortion despite the specific assurances in terms of irelands legal arrangements in this regard
7883378 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
7883379 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
7883380 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
7883381 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
7883382 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7883383 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7883384 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7883385 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7883386 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
7883387 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
7883388 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7883389 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7883390 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe
7883391 superstar david beckham kicked off the countdown to the london olympics and revealed he could be a coach for team gb in 2012 becks sent 91 000 spectators into a frenzy at beijings national stadium when he appeared from within a red london bus at yesterdays closing ceremony
7883392 rania wannous spokeswoman for visit london said the issue has been
7883393 this is a three minute film that is a few years old it has been used at many events before and we have never had any complaints
7883394 reinforcing what everyone thinks they know about the place this was brand marketing at its most effective
7883395 johnson amp johnson has been waiting until after the beijing games close today before making a statement when it is expected to say that it is cutting its involvement lenovo the chinese computer company like manulife sees no gain from a link with the london games kodak has been involved with the olympics since their revival in 1896 but its chief executive antonio perez said its sponsorship was no longer the best use of the companys money
7883396 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7883397 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7883398 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7883399 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7883400 comments such as these are clearly part of the pathetic choreography surrounding the so called policing and justice saga members of mr caol ins own party are disenchanted not only by the failure of their leaders to secure the devolution of such powers to stormont but also by their cosy relationship with the dup
7883401 martin mcguinness is on holiday and sinn fein has no interest in responding to demands by reg empey
7883402 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
7883403 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
7883404 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7883405 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7883406 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7883407 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7883408 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too
7883409 the psni as a political statement and thus they judge the psnis success not by its effectiveness but by its existence and that sad to say makes the psni the latest in a long line of political police forces here
7883410 i talked to mr blatter about how we could find a solution to this and i am confident fifa will give the assurances that the scottish welsh and irish associations want
7883411 i am also confident that when the people of scotland wales and
7883412 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7883413 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7883414 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk
7883415 no country in its right mind would want this pervert at large on its soil
7883416 all we can hope is that wherever he ends up he will be locked away until he ceases to be a threat to children
7883417 every non trivial system has some degree of emergent requirements and so it is impossible to eliminate end uncertainty through upfront thinking
7883418 youre self organizing so you figure out who your scrummaster is
7883419 so who should select a teams scrummaster my default position is that the decision should be left up to the team
7883420 one of the main goals in selecting an iteration length is finding one that encourages everyone to work at a consistent pace throughout the iteration
7883421 as long as the end date of a project is far in the future we dont feel any pressure and work leisurely when the pressure of the finish date becomes tangible we start working harder
7883422 this is a useless metric each spin of a roulette wheel is independent reds having shown up four or four hundred consecutive times has no influence on the next spin of the wheel
7883423 even if you dont schedule iteration reviews well in advance the regularity of the iterations is noticed by all involved parties
7883424 it seems like about time for another release by the napa team i should check in with them
7883425 over the next four months comprising eight two week iterations we will complete approximately 240 story points of work
7883426 because a teams ultimate destination will almost certainly move over the course of a project it is important to measure how close the team is to their current destination rather than how far theyve come since the start of the project
7883427 people assume that when you become a conductor youre into some sort of a napoleonic thing that you want to stand on that big box and wield your power im not a power junkie im a responsibility junkie
7883428 an intimate and detailed knowledge of how something works increases the chance of the leader helping the team surface the more subtle technical issues that must be addressed
7883429 were about to do a major check in of the payroll processing code we had to restructure the version control repository to do that which made us rewrite a big part of the build script but weve thoroughly tested everything and dont expect this check in to break anything
7883430 well address this issue that issue and resolve that other problem

7883474 the team were called to the earthquake back in 2005 in pakistan and at the time i was unable to go through a shoulder injury
7883475 so i stayed behind and did a lot of work with the raising of funds and tents and sleeping bags and things like that to send out to the victims of the earthquake
7883476 but as a long term project we focussed on the small community the schools has been destroyed and we focussed on trying to rebuild
7883477 six months down the line bob came up with the idea of getting a temporary school with the marquees that we took out
7883478 and so the children started their education six months after the earthquake
7883479 and thats carried until last year when the construction of a permanent school was begun and the six classroom girls primary school has been completed
7883480 he said look wed like one of the classrooms to be named people of wales school and i said to him bob if we raise enough money we will call the whole school people of wales school but lets see

7883550 there should be offshore drilling if appropriate all the measures should be there on the table
7883551 we have to do some drilling lets accept the fact that we have to do some drilling
7883552 i think you would find a lot of support for offshore drilling
7883553 i think you would find a lot of support for offshore drilling if it was tied to other things like renewable fuels wind energy solar energy amp other renewable transportation fuels
7883554 we have to drill in more places as quickly as we can
7883555 and we want to force the leadership of the republicans and the democrats to come to terms with reality which is we have to drill in more places as quickly as we can of which i am a big proponent
7883556 i am not opposed personally to the idea of expanding exploration for oil and for gas and in those cases where it is appropriate to get down and find the assets that are available to us as a nation and increase our national security
7883557 ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production
7883558 first of all as all of you know im from an oil producing state oil and gas producing state and ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production in addition to whats already open
7883559 w e must take advantage of our untapped oil resources in places where it makes sense

7883561 guest column from senator tester energy independence this independence day
7883562 ohio sen sherrod brown who had adamantly opposed such drilling is among those warming to the idea he says any exploration would have to be far from the coast and that the oil produced would be used in the united states not abroad
7883563 we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more
7883564 well i think we all know there are several elements to this we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more those are the two sides of the equation in terms of the supply demand relationship
7883565 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table
7883566 are not ready to embrace the idea of bipartisan compromise
7883567 schumer suggested congress will not move on a large energy plan until after the election
7883568 democratic leaders in the senate also are not ready to embrace the idea of a bipartisan compromise on energy legislation in part out of concern about adopting a position at odds with their expected presidential nominee senator barack obama of illinois
7883569 privately democrats have been frustrated that obama took such a long time to come out with a comprehensive energy policy and that his new plan appeared to be more about checking the box than engaging in a larger national debate on the issue
7883570 a lot of democrats were waiting for him to come out with something and he left us flat footed we didnt want to step on his toes and now we have some ground to make up
7883571 but the gop is positioning itself as the party willing to do whatever it takes to lower gas prices
7883572 democrats worried about defections in the ranks are scrambling to avoid votes on expanded drilling and this week canceled a series of senate committee sessions that could have provided an opening for republicans
7883573 majority leader reid has decided that deliberation is too taxing for
7883574 dems on the defensive over gop push for more oil
7883575 democratic leaders have tried to stave off a floor vote on the issue in part gop leaders say out of fear that some democrats may cast pro drilling votes
7883576 republicans refuse to discuss futures bill without coastal drilling vote
7883577 but the gop is positioning itself as the party willing to do whatever it takes to lower gas prices the republicans say democrats are scared to cast votes on new drilling in the face of voter anger over high gasoline prices and they point to the majoritys decision to scrap appropriations bills to avoid a debate over lifting the congressional ban on drilling along the outer continental shelf
7883578 democratic leaders caught off guard by a swing in public opinion and undermined by some of their own members are scrambling to run down the clock on calls to lift the ban on offshore oil drilling
7883579 we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more
7883580 well i think we all know there are several elements to this we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more those are the two sides of the equation in terms of the supply demand relationship
7883581 theres going to be substantially more drilling and substantially more conservation sen mary l landrieu d la said of the plan her moderate colleagues are hoping to cobble together
7883582 ive supported increased production of domestic oil and gas and i also think it makes sense to look at whether or not there are some areas in the outer continental shelf that could be opened for production

7883589 guest column from senator tester energy independence this independence day
7883590 ohio sen sherrod brown who had adamantly opposed such drilling is among those warming to the idea he says any exploration would have to be far from the coast and that the oil produced would be used in the united states not abroad
7883591 sen jim webb d va fresh from his gi bill victory said that he is now making energy a major priority we need to look at all our assets he said suggesting a large package including expanded offshore drilling alternative energy nuclear power and technology to make coal cleaner
7883592 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table
7883593 academics economists say that the costs of oil is 20 to 50 speculation
7883594 its not speculation it is supply and demand we dont have excess capacity in the world anymore and thats what youre seeing in oil prices
7883595 we havent evidence that speculators are broadly driving these prices
7883596 there is little evidence that large investment flows into the futures market are causing an imbalance between supply and demand and are therefore contributing to high oil prices blaming speculation is an easy solution which avoids taking the necessary steps to improve supply side access and investment or to implement measures to improve energy efficiency
7883597 if financial speculation were pushing all prices above the level consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum products to increase as supply rose and demand fell but in fact available data on oil inventories shows notable declines over the past year
7883598 when an issue is this hot it would be so much easier if there was a single reason to blame but calling it speculation is way too simplistic
7883599 the truth is that increased speculation in oil futures is not a cause of rising oil prices but rather an effect of those prices which have skyrocketed due to growth in global demand geopolitical instability and constricted supply in several producing countries
7883600 if congress is literally going over the cftcs head and talking about imposing legislation or making the cftc exercise its emergency powers to limit excess speculation when they dont even know what that means i dont even know what excess speculation means
7883601 theres no evidence of speculative influence speculators are not contributing to the demand for physical oil as they almost always roll positions prior to delivery
7883602 on any given day expectations determine the price but the spot market also has to clear and the way this happens is that excess supply must be added to physical stocks even with fairly inelastic supply and demand any large speculative deviation from the fundamental price should show up in a noticeable increase in inventories
7883603 they can offer their drilling amendment and we would offer our own alternative both measures would receive a vote that is how the legislative process is supposed to work
7883604 we are determined to walk out of here showing that we are responding more immediately to a concrete issue which is the pain people are feeling at the pump
7883605 i dont know if were going to pass anything but we certainly better vote on something before we go home
7883606 democrats are scrambling to appear pro drilling even as their leaders appear dead set against reversing the long standing drilling bans along the atlantic and pacific coasts
7883607 privately democrats have been worried that they havent responded quickly enough to the mounting gas price issue especially since bush and congressional republicans have been pushing for legislation for several months and made the issue the focal point of gop messaging
7883608 surging energy prices have forced democratic leaders to grapple with dissension in their ranks
7883609 trying to demonstrate that democrats are not opposed to drilling in acceptable locales
7883610 moderate democrats who favor drilling are trying to persuade their leaders to come around
7883611 senator harry reid of nevada the majority leader faces an increasing uneasiness among his colleagues who have signaled receptiveness to allowing more drilling
7883612 we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more
7883613 well i think we all know there are several elements to this we have got to deal with conserving using less we also have to produce more those are the two sides of the equation in terms of the supply demand relationship

7883638 general petraeus is going to come to the hill and make it clear to you that there is progress going on in iraq that the so called surge is working will you believe him when he says that
7883639 no i dont believe him because its not happening all you have to do is look at the facts
7883640 hes made a number of statements over the years that have not proven to be factual
7883641 he isnt in touch with whats going on in baghdad
7883642 and for someone whether its general petraeus or anyone else to say things are great in baghdad isnt in touch with whats going on in baghdad even though hes there and im not
7883643 petraeus report will pass through the white house spin machine where facts are often ignored or twisted and intelligence is cherry picked
7883644 this week president bush will send general petraeus to congress to report on the war but before the report arrives in congress it will pass through the white house spin machine where facts are often ignored or twisted and intelligence is cherry picked
7883645 by carefully manipulating the statistics the bush petraeus report will try to persuade us that violence in iraq is decreasing and thus the surge is working even if the figures were right the conclusion is wrong
7883646 i think that the reports that you provided to us really require the willing suspension of disbelief
7883647 i dont consider the surge a nuanced policy its killing our soldiers at a great rate i think that we need to look at reality senator biden talked to you about what the comptroller general said and youre going to argue about it i think the comptroller general ought to be listened to he says youre cherry picking your numbers in terms of the overall violence i ask you to take off your rosy glasses you had them on in 05
7883648 this the petraeus plan is ridiculous there is no plan he may be the only one who believes this is a good idea
7883649 this is ridiculous there is no plan i ask the president and everyone else who comes forward with a plan whether it is capping or surging or whatever they have will it answer the two word test then what then what then what what happens after we surge these women and men and by the way he said general petraeus is one who believes he may be the only one who believes this is a good idea virtually no one else thinks it is a good idea
7883650 there is some accuracy to so called cooking the books charges being leveled against petraeus
7883651 delaware sen joe biden said yesterday gen david petraeus is not betraying us as a liberal activist group charges but the democratic presidential hopeful did not reject charges that the military commander is using selected statistics to do the white houses bidding there is some accuracy to so called cooking the books charges being leveled against petraeus biden who chairs the senate foreign relations committee said yesterday in a telephone interview from washington
7883652 i think the general will present the facts with respect to the statistics and the tactical successes or situations as he sees them but none of us should be fooled not the american people not you in the media not us in congress we should not be fooled into this tactical success debate thats not what this is about
7883653 well let me well i dont think general petraeus has an independent view in that sense general petraeus is there to succeed he may say the progress is uneven he may say its substantial i dont know what he will say you can be sure well listen to it but i dont think hes an independent evaluator
7883654 asking general petraeus to evaluate the surge he has overseen in iraq is like asking a college student to grade his own term paper
7883655 today general petraeus once again came to capitol hill to ask congress to prolong our involvement in iraqs civil war his assessment of the situation in iraq was positive but not independent the simple fact is that asking general petraeus to evaluate the surge he has overseen in iraq is like asking a college student to grade his own term paper
7883656 that there are questions about gen petraeus report is not surprising the whack a mole strategy has made this the bloodiest summer of the war
7883657 the fact that there are questions about gen petraeus report is not surprising given that it was brought to you by this white house in contrast independent report after report indicates that the whack a mole strategy has made this the bloodiest summer of the war
7883658 right now our strategy on gas prices is drive small cars and wait for the wind
7883659 still 73 of the more than 1 000 americans surveyed from june 26 to 29 said they favored an expansion of offshore drilling for oil and natural gas in protected u s waters even though many environmental advocacy groups have deemed offshore drilling as hazardous to the environment
7883660 for example just over three quarters 76 percent support immediately increasing oil drilling in the united states a position recently espoused by presumptive republican nominee john mccain more than seven in 10 democrats 71 percent also hold this view
7883661 t he percentage of liberals who said expanding energy exploration was their most important priority doubled from 22 percent in february to 45 percent
7883662 t he number of people favoring drilling there increased to 50 percent compared to 42 percent last february
7883663 amid record gas prices public support for greater energy exploration is spiking much of the increase in support for energy exploration has come among groups that previously viewed this as a less important priority than energy conservation young people liberals independents democrats women and people who have attended college fully half of people ages 18 to 29 51 now say expanding energy exploration is a more important priority for energy policy than increasing energy conservation and regulation only about a quarter of young people 26 expressed this view in february the proportion of liberals who say expanded energy exploration is the more important priority also has doubled from 22 to 45
7883664 in a rather dramatic show of force 22 senate republicans attended a news conference in a grassy park outside the senate office buildings to trumpet the gas price reduction act of 2008 most of them did not get a chance to speak underscoring their dedication to the issue since most senators do not relish playing a backdrop role
7883665 republicans said they were reaching out a hand to democrats by not including a provision to allow oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge which the democrats oppose
7883666 this time with gas prices pushing 4 a gallon and more opposition may be weakening

7883680 republicans hoping energy measure adds fuel to election year strategy
7883681 senate republicans aim to undercut democrats claim to be the environmentally conscious party by combining their own conservation message with a longstanding push for more oil drilling

7883740 they throw around the word historic a lot in conventions and yet this one really is whether you favor obama or mccain you cant help but notice what a lot of us thought would never happen in this country
7883741 if you had told me that before i died one of the major parties in this country would nominate an african american for president id be amazed if you told me he would go to lynchburg to campaign as obama did last week id be stunned

7883748 but anytime you pick a catholic its also courting controversy
7883749 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7883750 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7883751 is as close to were going to be able to get as a society
7883752 there are elements within the church who say that if you are at odds with any of the teachings of the church you are at odds with the church i think the church is bigger than that
7883753 but his record of support for so called abortion rights while mixed at times is seriously wrong i certainly presume his good will and integrity and i presume that his integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7883754 i dont think its a happy day for catholics when a man who is literally dead wrong on what the catholic leadership of the united states has said for over three decades is the most important issue of social justice in our country is named to a national ticket and attempts to present himself as an intellectually serious and coherent catholic
7883755 the next republican that tells me im not religious im going to shove my rosary beads down their throat
7883756 hes this scrappy irish catholic and he has a long and powerful record of speaking his mind
7883757 i dont think hes going to take any attacks sitting down
7883758 take on both parties to pass the farthest reaching ethics reform since watergate
7883759 hes pretty much a conventional liberal on the issues and has few examples of breaking with his own party so how does obama try to pull off being post partisan
7883760 boren the lone democrat in oklahomas congressional delegate said that while obama has talked about working with republicans unfortunately his record does not reflect working in a bipartisan fashion
7883761 obama might have a similar bottom line core principles for which in some sense he is willing to die if so we dont know what they are

7883876 dont say i didnt warn you thosse things are dangerous
7883877 what are we supposed to do i say the bats and the birds too if they were smart theyd avoid the gigantic blades of death
7883878 baerwald and colleagues collected 188 dead bats from wind farms across southern alberta
7883879 studies have shown that some cats kill up to 1000 animals each year its clear that hundreds of millions of birds are dying
7883880 conservationists argue that feral cats contribute greatly to the killing of songbirds and other endangered birds with estimates that bird loss is at 100 million a year due to predation
7883881 while searching for bat carcasses under wind turbines we noticed that many of the carcasses had no external injuries or no visible cause of death

7883884 this year indy is quite a bit different from last year
7883885 last year was the first time for the countdown and we were quite a bit ahead in points much like no 1 in points tim wilkerson is right now and then of course they reset the points
7883886 i think in 2007 a lot of people kind of questioned how to approach it properly and obviously we proved that you dont have to be leading the countdown to win the championship
7883887 im really looking forward to seeing my team tested because it looks like were either going to be sixth or 10th in the points best case scenario is we will be in sixth place which is still going to put us quite a few points behind first 70 im really excited to see how my napa guys are going to react
7883888 i truly believe weve got the best leader there is in the pit area when you have to go to battle on race day

7883908 on wednesday arellano announced she would travel to washington d c to lobby for immigration reform and participate in a prayer meeting sept 12 lozano said those plans havent changed
7883909 arellano came illegally to the united states to washington state in 1997 she was deported to mexico shortly after but returned and moved to illinois in 2000 taking a job cleaning planes at ohare international airport she was arrested in 2002 at ohare and later convicted of working under a false social security number she was to surrender to authorities last august but asked instead to take refuge at her church to avoid deportation and separation from her son who is a u s citizen
7883910 arellano is accompanied by people close to her lozano said including the rev walter coleman pastor of adalberto united methodist church where she and her son have lived for more than a year lozano who is in los angeles declined to say whether arellanos 8 year old son saul is with her
7883911 but returned and moved to illinois in 2000 taking a job cleaning planes at ohare international airport
7883912 gertruda grzebska 63 said that for years she fed her husband jan carefully with a spoon and moved his body to prevent bed sores
7883913 for 19 years he did not move or say anything
7883914 he tried to say things but it couldnt be understood sometimes we pretended we understood

7883922 speaks of keeping armed men and illicit weapons out of the unifil zone
7883923 so we monitor that but disarming an armed militia is not in 1701
7883924 there will be no weapons or authority in lebanon other than that of the lebanese state
7883925 apart from un troops lebanese soldiers and local hunters no one is armed south of the litani river
7883926 hezbollahs refusal to disarm is officially based on its argument that it is a
7883927 graziano says hezbollah is one of the parties that agree with 1701 and support 1701 this is factually untrue as evidenced by hezbollahs armed offensive with impunity against the lebanese government and citizenry in may
7883928 graziano adds unifil has no commitment to the disarmament of hezbollah we are a peacekeeping force not peace enforcement this is contradictory to say the least and proof that unifil is a hollow force in lebanon
7883929 hezbollah is also terrorizing lebanese civilians in south lebanon often within eyesight and earshot of unifil troops and unifil never initiates any investigation whatsoever
7883930 for instance when hezbollah attacked across the country in may 2008 the organizations fighters ransacked the offices of the mufti of tyre and jabal amel unifil did absolutely nothing to either prevent this act or investigate it after the fact

7883954 we do not normally use any products from 97 b but it was one of those fluke things that we would have bought any products different than what we normally use and it just happened to be part of the extended list from the maple leaf recall
7883955 we took them all off the shelf as precaution because theres a possible chance that other varieties of roast beef could have been in contact with the roast beef that we used for irving and sub delicious
7883956 we have removed them from the shelves and have replaced them with new products that are not part of that plant number at all which we normally dont have in our plant anyway

7884175 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
7884176 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
7884177 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
7884178 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
7884179 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
7884180 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in

7884189 jowood is an excellent partner with high quality compelling games that are some of the best selling titles in europe games including painkiller gothic 3 and the panzer series are ideally suited for falcon integration and have sold in excess of 3 5 million units

7884193 runtime cycle life and power are at the beginning of nearly every discussion we have with our customers
7884194 based on what we see in the survey data engineers and designers believe that with the proper cell selection and battery electronics they can create a competitive advantage for their products with a better battery pack
7884195 the design of the electronics in a battery pack that control charge and discharge with elements such as gas gauging is key to improving performance and we can see in the study that the industry is coming to appreciate that
7884196 ensuring that the charge or discharge cycles dont terminate prematurely or that the pack is not abusively charged or over discharged affects both capacity and cycle life
7884197 that cost appeared so low on the priority list for both groups we surveyed and nearly at the bottom among our marketing contacts battery performance clearly is seen as a core competitive advantage by our customers and that should be the primary consideration as we make design decisions on new battery packs for our customers
7884198 safety was seen as the second most important characteristic in selecting the right battery chemistry by engineers and designers right after runtime performance
7884199 safetys been on our customers minds more than ever lately and thats always a big question during our customer meetings they want to know if a change in battery chemistry will affect safety and they dont want to do anything to subject their designs to a potential recall
7884200 there have been many new developments in terms of technology and regulation in the industry of late and the survey responses indicate a broad divergence between those who understand their impact and those who dont
7884201 there are so many different variants of lithium ion cells for instance and not every one fits every application
7884202 some are better suited to high temperature some are ideal for supporting higher discharge rates the key element is to understand all the different cell chemistries available and to select the right one that delivers the longest runtime and overall performance while taking into account the applications other requirements such as size cost and weight
7884203 a thorough understanding of the new lithium battery shipping regulations
7884204 because of our experience in so many different battery technologies in use today rather than just a few specialties were well positioned to assist our customers in making the right decisions in balancing performance and trade off decisions

7884464 bonjour thierry im offering this track exclusively to you and your websites for whatever you want with it it is the leading intro vocal from the zeitgeistmovie published on google video and i took that leading part and wrapped a few bits of sounds around it to make it emphasize the video and the reasoning behind im not sure if i really follow my idea of searching for other speeches from the video i have especially not found the speech of richard albert as well as another speech i think its the same one that norman fairbanks used in one of his tenori on tracks and im also not sure even if i would do more of this kind where the place would be to exist other than on my harddisk my brain and my ears the film is creative commons and such the music is too so if you want to do something more than just announcing it feel free to do so i came to think that myspace is just partly the right place for something like this to be to be heard but maybily not to exist in that shithole of a flashplayer

7884491 they have all done so very well and its not right to pick out one in particular they have all tried their very best
7884492 it is a breath of fresh air in a dreich miserable summer
7884493 loads of people we know have changed their attitude already to 2012
7884494 they say they feel proud to be british i think everybody is now beginning to feel excited by the 2012 idea

7884499 it appears we are going to miss out on the rains again we were hoping that tropical storm fay was coming so we would receive some much needed rains maybe next go round
7884500 drought continues to cause decline in corn pasture and hay condition commercial grape harvest beginning
7884501 doesnt look like tropical storm fay is going to be any help
7884502 much needed rain was received over the weekend from the tropical system
7884503 tropical storm fay brought from 3 6 inches of rain countywide
7884504 tropical storm fay brought only minimal moisture to this area but were thankful and expect more along with rest of state hay and pastures have made some gains lately but are still way off thoughts are on small grain for winter grazing plantings and clover additions into pastures
7884505 we are anticipating rainfall from tropical storm fay we did receive 2 08 inches of rainfall on aug 13 which was our highest recording of rainfall for the month
7884506 lots of cloud cover but very little precipitation so far due to tropical storm fay
7884507 welcome rains pastures and hayfields greening up corn harvesting halted due to rain
7884508 rains last week and cooler conditions this week have helped replenish soil moisture pasture conditions are better this week as a result livestock are healthier due to milder weather many farmers are weaning calves during this time
7884509 tropical storm fay expected to bring heavy rainfall to area during the weekend
7884510 tropical storm fay did significant damage to remaining corn cotton and pecans
7884511 significant amounts of rain are expected over the weekend from tropical storm fay
7884512 heavy rainfall up to 25 inches in some parts of the county
7884513 some tobacco growers are 95 percent harvested however my largest grower is only 65 percent harvested we also have a lot of corn not harvested that we are concerned this storm may damage we need some rain but not in excess or high winds
7884514 getting lots of rainfall from tropical storm fay all farming operations in the field have ceased still feeding livestock and conducting broiler duties working in shop to get harvest equipment ready and general maintenance of equipment concerned about soybean rust and soil diseases in peanuts after the storm corn is vulnerable to wind and grain rot but on the bright side the rainfall is much needed to replenish reserves in ponds streams and creeks and rivers and aquifer and subsoil moisture etc hate to see all of the erosion and any crop destruction tobacco may be drowning also we will just have to wait and see
7884515 three to 4 inches of rain from tropical storm fay
7884516 when 70 percent of the nations soybeans 62 percent of the corn and 22 percent of our domestic petroleum are transported by barges we need a strong federal commitment to keep this system open and functioning
7884517 its unfortunate that some of our ports and harbors may have to close when agriculture is one of the few positive contributors to this nations balance of trade
7884518 barges are a far more economical method of shipping than rail or truck the nations shippers save 3 billion a year by moving their goods by barge the typical barge can move 750 000 bushels of corn that same amount would require 870 trucks
7884519 pipelines and railroads are already at maximum capacity and building new facilities is difficult because of environmental and other regulatory requirements
7884520 theres a lot of room to grow traffic on the mississippi and other inland waterways
7884521 but maintenance and improvement of locks dams and other facilities are critical to insure the most efficient barge usage
7884522 27 are past their design life and in varying stages of disintegration its disheartening whats happening to the infrastructure on the mississippi river
7884523 the tenn tom and the mississippi river are two of the nations finest waterway systems and a vital part of this countrys transportation network
7884524 we have been in continuous no till on our family farm since 1999 we know we are improving soil quality and using less nitrogen but its a slow process we want to jump start the process and reduce the number of years it takes see input costs go down and yields stay high
7884525 we are hoping to demonstrate some ways to cut that time frame so growers can take more immediate advantages of no till farming systems
7884526 last year in pumpkin fields where we planted vetch we used only the standard 65 70 pounds of nitrogen and had a great crop in fields with rye only as a cover crop we had to come back with an additional 40 50 pounds of nitrogen per acre
7884527 we know we get about 250 pound of nitrogen uptake from the cover crops if we can make half that available for grain crops planted into the stubble we will be able to save significant money on fertilizer
7884528 glyphosate gramoxone none of the usual burndown herbicides will take out vetch
7884529 to be successful a grower must have bicep or some other plant growth regulator in the mix in our 40 acre test field the combination did an outstanding job of controlling rye vetch and the rye vetch combination
7884530 we want our system to work without the cost sharing money thats why we are taking this study to the next level using high tech equipment like the red ball applicator greenseeker tissue sensor and ultimately gps guided precision applied variable rates of fertilizer
7884531 there has been an expansion of demand for dark tobacco and at least a 25 percent or 30 percent increase in acreage this year
7884532 it could be attractive to our farmers the yield of this type is good and the price per pound is higher than either flue cured or burley
7884533 but in case there is i think we need some information to see if we can grow it and cure it here and whether it would be economical
7884534 i have been told by visitors who work in dark tobacco that ours looks typical
7884535 i think the curing season will be much like burley
7884536 the curing structures are also very similar since they are both air cured we have not yet looked at curing dark tobacco with fire that would be a considerably different situation than what we have here
7884537 a farmer could manage the dark to come off first then move to the burley extending the harvest season
7884538 it is traditionally grown on heavier soils but with the right management i think we could grow it anywhere
7884539 who called me into politics it was you people what do you want it should be rule by the people for the people
7884540 it will be the part of backward and weaker sections farmers labours and women it will be party which will fight for social justice which will take andhra pradesh towards economic development and prosperity and industrial development it will make the state a santosha andhra pradesh chirunavvulu andhra pradesh and ananda andhra pradesh

7884549 we took six beers to the great british beer festival and bonkers conkers really flew off the stand
7884550 on the saturday bonkers conkers sold out with three hours of the festival still to go

7884579 is not that church alone able to maintain her truthfulness which always remembers that she will find her goal not in herself but in gods kingdom because she thus knows that too much is not required of her that she does not need to provide anything at all final to offer any lasting home that she must not be surprised if in her provisional nature she is shaken with doubts blocked by hinderances and oppressed by cares
7884580 since the church then knows that with all her efforts what ultimately counts is not her theories and practices that it is not her catalogue of achievement and her brilliant statistics which guarantee the coming of the kingdom of god and hence that no want of an echo may prevent her from continuing to call no failure dishearten her
7884581 does a church which in this end time overlooks the fact that she exists for selfless service to men to enemies to the world not ose her truthfulness and thus also her dignity her validity her reason for existing because she abandons the true imitation of christ consequently does not the church alone which remains aware of the fact that it is not she but gods reign which will come in power and great glory does not this church alone find her true greatness and thus her truthful existence only in being small
7884582 can she even with all the proofs of grace reaching her and precisely because of these proofs in fact ever give herself airs as a self righteous caste or class of the pure and holy she can in fact never imagine evil unholiness impurity as existing only outside herself there is in fact nothing within her that is perfect not in peril not fragile not dubious that does not need to be constantly correctd and excelled
7884583 can the church ever be allowed to avoid this radical obedience to gods will as if she could declare as eternal laws what are always time conditioned arrangements and which can then be adapted to the ever recurring present only with the aid of artificial and twisted interpretation as if in matters of decisive importance she could swallow a camel and on the other hand with petty casuistry strain at a gnat as if she could thus lay on mens shoulders the burden of innumerable laws and regulations which they are not able to bear as if instead of a heartfelt obedience out of love for god she could demand a blind obedience out of fear the obedience of someone who does not act in this way because he understands and approves the requirement but only because it is commanded and would act otherwise if it were not commanded as if there could be a question here of external legality instead of internal conviction of the traditions of the elders instead of the signs of the times of lip service instead of sincerity of heart of commandments of men instead of the absolute uncurtailed will of god

7884638 kenyan born juginder lamba is one of the most acclaimed figurative sculptors in britain this exhibition includes over 50 of his exquisitely crafted works in wood stone and bronze illustrating his expressive approach to the human figure and natural forms his often life size male and female figures have a vibrant dynamic quality reflecting the passions of love loss and anguish while others embody a serene inner stillness he often uses salvaged timbers from old buildings respecting the origin and history of each piece as part of the finished work
7884639 the rich amalgam of cultural influences at large in his work are important but they do not define his approach rather they are paths towards more universal mythologies and notions of the human condition one of the main strengths of his work is that it addresses fundamental themes in a figurative idiom without becoming trite or sentimental that is what makes it so compelling the standing figure gazing upwards the embracing lovers the reclined figure the mother and child and the plant form bursting with life are all archetypes embedded deep in the collective consciousness

7884660 as part of discussions with council officials over the possibility of a static library for seven kings i have suggested that there are several community buildings in the area that could be considered for the siting of a library these include schools and faith buildings including st johns seven kings to date the council has not shown any interest in this suggestion and i am not therefore in discussions with them about it i would be very happy to begin discussions however the councils unwillingness to explore the possibility of working with community organisations to identify both possible locations and possible sources of funds for a library seem symptomatic of the councils refusal to engage in a meaningful partnership with the community that it seeks to serve the redbridge conversation is a prime example hyped as the way forward for community consultation by councils the redbridge conversation was actually primarily concerned with the councils own agenda and the councils options for funding that agenda as a result the priorities of the local community like a static library for seven kings for example didnt feature and neither did the option of working with community organisations to draw new funding into the borough this is because the council is at present not appearing to seek genuine consultation and partnership from and with the local community if it were it would be open to changing its agenda and exploring alternative and more creative ways of funding initiatives instead it is seeking endorsement of its fixed agenda which as we know from the protests over the possibility of allotment sales and other local issues does not have the support of the local community as a result i appeal to the cabinet in considering the issue of a static library for seven kings and other issues within the borough to begin engaging in genuine consultation and partnership with the local community and community organisations

7884867 the report shows a 19 per cent decrease in opium cultivation to 157 000 hectares down from a record harvest of 193 000 in 2007
7884868 if helmand were a country it would once again be the worlds biggest producer of illicit drugs
7884869 there is now a perfect overlap between zones of high risk and regions of high opium cultivation
7884870 since drugs are funding insurgency and insurgency enables drug cultivation insurgency and narcotics must be fought together
7884871 afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world and the latest food crisis has made farmers even more vulnerable
7884872 this must be done now while farmers are deciding whether or not to plant opium for the 2008 09 harvest timely and targeted international assistance is vital
7884873 corrupt officials landowners warlords and criminals must feel the full force of the law otherwise the opium economy will continue to operate with impunity and the taliban will continue to profit from it
7884874 drugs and terrorists should not determine the fate of afghanistan

7884885 its not surprising to anybody that there are still difficult issues to come to agreement on that there are still gaps
7884886 and in fact i believe that the parties have succeeded in moving their understandings of what needs to be achieved and indeed they are positioned somewhat closer together over this period of time
7884887 we are certainly not anywhere near the point that we were a year ago
7884888 impressed with the work the negotiators have achieved so far
7884889 i dont think the settlement activity is helpful to the process that in fact what we need now are steps that enhance confidence between the parties and anything that undermines confidence between the parties ought to be avoided

7884895 ryanairs engineers have inspected the aircraft overnight and have confirmed that the oxygen masks which deployed were working properly

7884897 ryanairs maintenance is very good it has the youngest fleet of aircraft in europe and their maintenance organisation is first class

7885039 angela merkel tourt auf bildungsreise durch die republik ein thema spielt keine rolle jungen werden in der schule benachteiligt und fallen hinter die m dchen zur ck
7885040 sagt ihr sprecher es falle nicht in ihre ressortkompetenz man wundert sich ein wenig das thema um das es geht ist die benachteiligung von jungen im deutschen bildungssystem von einer ministerin deren ressort auch f r die jugend zust ndig ist k nnte man ein gewisses interesse erwarten von der leyen u ert sich sonst gern zu dingen f r die sie nicht direkt zust ndig ist zu kinderkrippen zum beispiel das ist ein thema das politisch n tzlich ist vielleicht liegt hier ein grund f r ihre zur ckhaltung es ist f r eine politikerin gut sich f r die gleichbehandlung von frauen einzusetzen das wirkt modern und zeitgem der kampf f r benachteiligte jungen klingt irgendwie gestrig
7885041 dabei sind die unterschiede zwischen jungen und m dchen in der schule mittlerweile ein gro es problem jungen schneiden in fast allen bereichen schlechter ab 47 prozent der m dchen gehen auf ein gymnasium bei den jungen sind es nur 41 prozent fast ein drittel der m dchen macht abitur oder fachabitur aber nur ein knappes viertel der jungen die sind im schnitt eine note schlechter als die m dchen es gibt deutlich mehr jungen die nicht einmal einen hauptschulabschluss schaffen m nnliche sch ler werden deutlich h ufiger an eine sonderschule berwiesen der schulabschluss beeinflusst die gesamte erwerbsbiografie junge m nner sind deutlich h ufiger arbeitslos als junge frauen das ist nicht nur ein individuelles problem sondern ein gesellschaftliches
7885042 der zur benachteiligung von m dchen f hrte jetzt haben m dchen eben bessere noten weil sie bessere sch ler sind
7885043 hei t es in der wirklichkeit kann von gleichberechtigung an den schulen keine rede sein der hallenser bildungsforscher j rgen budde kam in einem bericht f r das bundesbildungsministerium zu erstaunlichen schl ssen so erhalten jungen in allen f chern bei gleicher kompetenz schlechtere noten auch wenn sie die gleichen noten haben wie die m dchen empfehlen die lehrer ihnen seltener das gymnasium kurzum sch ler werden bei gleicher leistung schlechter behandelt als ihre mitsch lerinnen
7885044 die zahl der lehrerinnen ist gestiegen an vielen grundschulen sind lehrer bereits exoten hinzu kommt dass einige fragw rdige annahmen der geschlechterforschung l ngst den schulalltag bestimmen dazu geh rt die berzeugung dass verhalten das typisch m nnlich ist oder als solches gilt schlecht ist jede harmlose schulhofrangelei steht mittlerweile unter gewaltverdacht und wird unterbunden nat rlich ist es sinnvoll kleinen jungen zu erkl ren dass schlagen keine l sung ist aber muss bei jeder rauferei gleich der konfliktlotse angerannt kommen der unterricht schreibt der frankfurter bildungsforscher frank dammasch sei eher an weibliche formen des lernens und gestaltens angepasst wenn sich jungen wie jungen verhalten wird dies dagegen sanktioniert
7885045 der unterrichtsstoff geht oft an jungeninteressen vorbei wer leseb cher f r deutsche grundschulen durchbl ttert oder sich diktate zeigen l sst der wird darin wenig ber fu ball oder piraten lesen stattdessen d rfen die kinder dar ber schreiben wie es ist mit nackten f en durchs gras zu gehen und libellen zu beobachten dabei ist wissenschaftlich untersucht dass sich die leistungen von jungen verbessern wenn die themen sie interessieren tauchen w rter wie schiedsrichter oder torwart in den texten auf erzielen jungen in der rechtschreibung leicht bessere werte als m dchen sonst hinken sie in diesem bereich deutlich hinterher eine naheliegende konsequenz w re es st rker auf die inhaltlichen interessen der jungen einzugehen man muss ja im kunstunterricht nicht immer nur schmetterlinge als hinterglasbilder malen lassen es k nnte ja auch mal eine ritterburg sein
7885046 doch bisher h ngt es vom engagement der lehrerin oder des lehrers ab ob auf die interessen von jungen r cksicht genommen wird
7885047 in der sogenannten m nnerarbeit tummeln sich gruppen wie der berliner verein
7885048 sagt die leiterin einer arbeitsgruppe zur bubenf rderung im bayerischen kultusministerium anne blank
7885049 schreibt die leiterin der abteilung geschlechterforschung am deutschen jugendinstitut in m nchen waltraud corneli en das ist ein perfides argument w re es demnach in ordnung zehnj hrige jungen in der schule zu benachteiligen weil erwachsene frauen im beruf benachteiligt werden
7885050 ich finde es nicht schlimm dass m dchen in sachen bildung an den jungen vorbeiziehen
7885051 sagte sie in einem interview deutsche m nner definierten sich noch immer ber ihren erfolg im beruf das m sse sich ndern
7885052 wie immer wenn ber weltanschauliche dinge gestritten wird gibt es auch in der bildungsdiskussion handfeste machtpolitische interessen
7885053 kritisiert der heidelberger p dagoge michael matzner die frage ist ob verfechter einer einseitig auf m dchen ausgerichteten bildungspolitik nicht beiden schaden den jungen und den m dchen in der feminisierten deutschen schullandschaft haben auch die m dchen weniger chancen sich die f higkeiten anzueignen die sie in vern nftigen ma en sp ter im beruf brauchen risikobereitschaft konkurrenzdenken aggressivit t

7885070 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7885071 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7885072 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7885073 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7885074 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7885075 i suppose the cold air funnels might knock over a garbage can if it touched down

7885221 runtime cycle life and power are at the beginning of nearly every discussion we have with our customers
7885222 based on what we see in the survey data engineers and designers believe that with the proper cell selection and battery electronics they can create a competitive advantage for their products with a better battery pack
7885223 the design of the electronics in a battery pack that control charge and discharge with elements such as gas gauging is key to improving performance and we can see in the study that the industry is coming to appreciate that
7885224 ensuring that the charge or discharge cycles dont terminate prematurely or that the pack is not abusively charged or over discharged affects both capacity and cycle life
7885225 that cost appeared so low on the priority list for both groups we surveyed and nearly at the bottom among our marketing contacts battery performance clearly is seen as a core competitive advantage by our customers and that should be the primary consideration as we make design decisions on new battery packs for our customers
7885226 safety was seen as the second most important characteristic in selecting the right battery chemistry by engineers and designers right after runtime performance
7885227 safetys been on our customers minds more than ever lately and thats always a big question during our customer meetings they want to know if a change in battery chemistry will affect safety and they dont want to do anything to subject their designs to a potential recall
7885228 there have been many new developments in terms of technology and regulation in the industry of late and the survey responses indicate a broad divergence between those who understand their impact and those who dont
7885229 there are so many different variants of lithium ion cells for instance and not every one fits every application
7885230 some are better suited to high temperature some are ideal for supporting higher discharge rates the key element is to understand all the different cell chemistries available and to select the right one that delivers the longest runtime and overall performance while taking into account the applications other requirements such as size cost and weight
7885231 a thorough understanding of the new lithium battery shipping regulations
7885232 because of our experience in so many different battery technologies in use today rather than just a few specialties were well positioned to assist our customers in making the right decisions in balancing performance and trade off decisions

7885240 ich muss dort einiges neues lernen aber soweit ich mich erinnere habe ich die rallye neuseeland sehr gemocht
7885241 dort darf man nicht zu aggressiv fahren man muss ganz nat rlich fahren und sich dem rhythmus hingeben von daher ist ein bisschen wie in schweden ich versuche keine fehler zu machen und kann damit hoffentlich ein gutes ergebnis holen

7885253 this will ensure that other residents in the tenement can live in the peace and quiet that they deserve and to receive some respite for the next three months from the anti social behaviour that has upset their lives for a considerable amount of time

7885286 we said several weeks ago that metro legal would concoct some kind of opinion to support the mayors position he didnt want people to vote on this matter
7885287 of course the legal director who works for the mayor is going to back into an opinion to support that position

7885463 thats a bit of hard one its just an interest in music i have always been into music when we were at school and hip hop came out i was always the person who had the stereo playing tapes it was just a fascination with music in my opinion its the djs who create the music at the end of the day they are defining whats happening when the scene took off i was already a dj i was already into house music or techno or whatever it was when it first came out it was never really an ambition like oh i wanna be a dj it just kind of happened simply because i was into music

7885489 of that i am confident our performance in liege was poor but the result was good we did not concede and we hope that playing the second leg at anfield will make a massive difference
7885490 this was not because of the upcoming liverpool match they were just too tired to play i respect every competition and will always play with the team which i think is the strongest no player is always a certain starter with me and i think tiredness will be our biggest problem this season whether we reach the champions league group stage or not my squad is not very big

7885492 our same store sales compared to last year headed in a positive direction during the quarter despite depressed consumer confidence and a tougher economy
7885493 faced with recent disappointing results including steeper than expected volume declines and higher than expected increases in pet resin costs we initiated a comprehensive financial review of our business
7885494 it has now become clear that our previously announced target is out of reach
7885495 mainly due to heavier than anticipated national brand promotional activity
7885496 the disappointing results we have seen over the past few weeks at the beginning of our most critical quarter indicate we will fall substantially short of our expectations for 2008
7885497 our focus for the remainder of 2008 is to implement our plans to refocus cott on its private label business we believe this remains the best path to improved profitability

7885538 i got headaches i couldnt sleep and i would vomit almost every day
7885539 i went to see a doctor and they diagnosed me with psych asthenia only then did things start to get better
7885540 we encounter a whole range of conditions in the younger generations depression anxiety and stress along with psychological problems stemming from sexual abuse dealing with hiv aids or other forms of severe trauma
7885541 psychologists in cambodia are not dealing primarily with postwar trauma anymore
7885542 for many years i didnt want other people around me i couldnt control myself
7885543 among the local population we do see many instances of psychological trauma related to family and cultural issues
7885544 often people do not know how to cope with the stresses they suffer and so they internalize it they have no outlet
7885545 most patients are women twice as many as men because women get pressure from both their families and society
7885546 some of them dont know they have a mental illness they think they have been hurt by black magic or that they have done something to offend their guardian spirit
7885547 while older generations will suppress their problems or look to spiritual means to cope the younger generations are starting to seek help when they are concerned about their psychological health
7885548 we now see many 15 to 25 year olds who see that there are options available to them
7885549 i think we can reduce the number of instances of mental health problems among cambodian people in the future if we can address some of the more serious issues in society right now
7885550 until people get sick they dont usually know its there
7885551 we think its the most underdiagnosed disease in the country
7885552 about 150 000 can expect to get sick some very much so
7885553 most people maintain just the right amount of iron in their bodies
7885554 it takes a while for even an astute physician to detect
7885555 its interesting how different the presentation is from patient to patient its such a jumble and thats what puts a burden on the general practitioner
7885556 were tying to get an iron test put in there so we can get at iron loading
7885557 ninety percent of the iron absorbed will go to the liver
7885558 if a person comes in and cant open their fist thats referred to as iron fist
7885559 heres a person who was able to tuck away the iron without it causing destruction of the organs
7885560 and yet there are other people who cant handle it
7885561 when you take blood out of the body iron stored in body tissue is used to make new blood
7885562 most people only are allowed to give blood once every seven weeks
7885563 this is the first step to getting out of the drought situation we are in
7885564 while its good to see the rain it doesnt mean that it will get the river up to where we need to be to leave mandatory restrictions
7885565 the mills river long term flow is dependent on ground water
7885566 the forecast for the rest of the week looks promising
7885567 theres a good prospect for rain over the course of the next couple of days
7885568 rainfall should be rather substantial across the mountains in your area the potential exists up across the hendersonville asheville area for 4 to 6 inches of rain by thursday morning
7885569 this rain is an encouraging first step toward getting out of the drought and off mandatory water restrictions
7885570 the one good aspect of the rain is that lawns are getting water and plants are getting watered
7885571 the water restrictions will remain in place until we advise otherwise
7885572 the decision to come out of mandatory restrictions depends on the sustained levels of the mills river
7885573 mondays rain could increase the flow to 40 or 50 cubic feet per second but then it could drop back down rapidly after the rain before mondays rain the river has been at the lowest level since the drought with levels hovering right at 19 cubic feet per second

7885583 i believe ancelotti has to be happy with our recruits it is a squad for the scudetto
7885584 with shevchenko we never never talked about kaka so fans should stay calm
7885585 we have said it again and again in the last two years that he will not leave
7885586 i dont think at least for me that it will make any difference we know the money is really important but now we are so close to the end of the it wont make a massive difference
7885587 so the key for me will be to do the right things in the game and have enough confidence so that we arent talking about if we have money or not
7885588 the team wasnt good enough around them but i think both players were linking well and the understanding is improving
7885589 we know we have enough quality and good players to win this game
7885590 ive seen a lot of areas we need to improve in over the last three games we have been analysing the games and the reasons why and we need to get back to our form in the pre season games when we were scoring lots of goals
7885591 i wanted to convince him to give up a comfortable life and a bright future to come to chicago to take up the toughest of challenges for a salary of just 10 000 a year
7885592 it was not difficult to convince barack to take the job all i had to do was describe what had happened to people on the south side of chicago the region had once been the largest producer of steel in the entire world but the mills had shut down one by one other industries began to close then stores and offices without jobs neighborhoods unraveled and kids became easy prey for gangs and drugs
7885593 many before had quit in frustration at the challenges of organizing not barack if something didnt work hed stay up all night long until he figured out what went wrong and how to fix it with his help people who had been shut out of decisions and robbed of dignity all their lives found their voice and found one another
7885594 he was their teacher he stayed out of the limelight so they could shine
7885595 he earned their trust he listened to the stories of their lives and helped them write a new story he became one of the family single mothers much like his own mom fed him and tried to fatten him up obviously that didnt work
7885596 when he told me he had decided to leave organizing to attend law school this is what he said we need significant change if we are to remain a nation of fairness dignity and hope
7885597 he wanted to be in a place where he could help others to bring about that change neither of us could have imagined on that night 20 years ago that the place would be the white house but this is america this is the place where dreams come true barack obama offers the change we need
7885598 britney spears will not be performing at the vmas this year im telling you officially and unequivocally
7885599 contrary to media reports britney was never slated to perform on this years vmas shes in the middle of recording her next album which is going amazingly well and her focus remains on the studio
7885600 i am proud to be associated with you i think you did better than anyone could have because of your standing your reputation and your integrity
7885601 i want to see the president of the united states succeed in iraq his success is americas success and his failure is americas failure
7885602 this disconnect i believe is fueling cynicism that is undermining the single most important weapon we need to give our troops to be able to do their job and that is the unyielding support of the american people that support is waning

7885605 biden has carved out a niche as the democratic presidential candidate most willing to publicly rebuke antiwar sentiment

7885608 when biden went after john mccain with a vigor and yes a venom that has been missing from obamas stump speaking it was a tonic for the troops who have been waiting for a campaign that is more prepared to throw punches than take them

7885628 this is in the national interest it is the image of our national music national culture especially the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important extremely serious matter
7885629 we made the decision that the voice we would use was yang peiyis the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
7885630 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in the aspect of voice yang peiyi is flawless
7885631 we had been through several inspections they were all very strict when we rehearsed at the spot there were spectators from various divisions especially a leader from the politburo who gave us his opinion it must change
7885632 i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi that is to say we have a perfect voice and a perfect image and representation in our teams view combined together
7885633 adults may lie but leave the kids out of it

7885644 i am deeply honored to have been invited to offer a religious voice at this celebration of american democracy the opportunity to do so at an evening of such historic significance to our nation is especially meaningful
7885645 dit is een directe schending van de talrijke resoluties van de vn veiligheidsraad met betrekking tot de territoriale integriteit van georgi die rusland zelf heeft goedgekeurd
7885646 de secretaris generaal van de navo jaap de hoop scheffer heeft vandaag de beslissing van rusland veroordeeld om de twee georgische provincies zuid osseti en abchazi te erkennen
7885647 een ander opvallende uitkomst is dat de meerderheid van de respondenten bang is om fouten te maken gevoelig is voor de mening van anderen en doet daarom sterk aan zelfcensuur

7885654 i think youd be na ve to expect youre going to go out and pull the michigan deal all the time
7885655 there were a lot of circumstances against michigan we played well they didnt play very well i dont think they realized we had that kind of speed lsus a completely different deal we played lsu in 2005 a 24 0 lsu victory they know about us we know about them
7885656 we felt we were deficient in those areas and this was the best and easiest way to go and acquire those things
7885657 but it has become a way of life because of budget pressures
7885658 i dont think were in this business to play people where its a mismatch whether its up or down
7885659 we have all the intentions in the world of playing as hard as we can and ultimately win but the stats are there to prove that 98 percent of the time the i aa team doesnt win
7885660 we use it as an advantage not only with our current team but with recruits theyre pumped up as they can be to play in front of 90 000 people and see how they compare with elite programs

7885667 although mosquitoes carrying wnv have not been found in the province this season albertans cannot let their guard down when outdoors

7885679 the dollar index has shown that it can at time override the oil fundamentals and will probably dominate until gustav defines a more definitive path
7885680 but the market is reacting to it and edging up
7885681 the publication of these reports today emphasises the importance that i place on driving through improved standards
7885682 the inspections will challenge hygiene practice in our hospitals at ward level on a regular basis and inform the actions that trusts now need to take to address the identified shortcomings
7885683 i am confident that we can continue to improve hygiene standards and raise public confidence in the quality of care provided by our hospitals
7885684 trusts have already addressed much of the rqia recommendations and the rolling programme of rqia inspections will ensure that progress is sustained
7885685 staff are working hard to stop the spread of hospital infections and no one should be concerned about using our hospitals we all have a part to play by ensuring that when we visit a hospital we strictly observe the hygiene standards and we strictly respect visiting policies
7885686 if the timing is off the brain wont set up its circuits properly
7885687 the eyes are ready and seeing properly you can rewire now
7885688 the eye is telling the brain when to become plastic rather than the brain developing on its own clock
7885689 the idea that this class of molecular messenger is passed from cell to cell is considered unorthodox in cell biology
7885690 early excitatory input is important to make first contacts between neurons
7885691 the nervous system is recycling an embryonic factor to induce brain plasticity
7885692 obesity is an increasing problem with 66 percent of the adults in the united states being overweight or obese
7885693 in germany 50 percent of the adult population is overweight while gaining too much weight can present health risks its even more dangerous to have the abdominal type of obesity people should measure their waistline from time to time and avoid the accumulation of abdominal fat
7885694 if the waist to hip ratio values were greater than 97 for men and 84 for women then individuals faced almost eight times increased risk for stroke compared to individuals with a whr less than 0 92 in men or less than 0 78 in women
7885695 by using different statistical approaches it was confirmed that waist to hip ratio appeared to be the strongest predictor of stroke and tia risk
7885696 this was a strong trend but not statistically significant and will require further research
7885697 physicians should measure patients waistlines and use the waist to hip ratio to estimate stroke risk world health organization defined categories of whr or waist circumference should be used doctors should also consider the whole vascular risk profile to minimize or modify all possible factors contributing to coronary heart disease stroke and peripheral artery disease
7885698 physical activity was much more common in the controls than in the stroke and tia patients
7885699 for example a mediterranean diet containing fish and olive oil can lower your risk of coronary heart disease and possibly also lower stroke risk
7885700 we urgently need trials to test the effect of weight loss on vascular risk profiles especially on the risk of stroke
7885701 we listened carefully to what doctors nurses hospital administrators and patients had to say
7885702 by making a few changes we were able to address several of those issues while remaining confident that were protecting patients
7885703 as with other surgeries its important that doctors and their hospitals repeat procedures often enough to do every one of them well
7885704 based on our research we concluded that a minimum of 300 would be practical for hospitals and also protect patients
7885705 that personal stuff was absolutely nothing it was blown way out of proportion by a sheriff who wanted his fifteen minutes of fame but my family is wonderful they are so very happy so were all great

7885740 i was using sir donald as an example in which the distinction was almost negated so great did his power of choice seem to be
7885741 if ever a character was a real life walter mitty it was him
7885742 but sir donald didnt just dream about winning anything he actually did it in any sport he put his mind to
7885743 and then challenged lindrum to a return encounter and matched him
7885744 he asked me for the thick rule book then he read it overnight all night
7885745 oh sh t craig we were supposed to get married
7885746 i dont think at least for me that it will make any difference we know the money is really important but now we are so close to the end of the it wont make a massive difference
7885747 so the key for me will be to do the right things in the game and have enough confidence so that we arent talking about if we have money or not
7885748 the team wasnt good enough around them but i think both players were linking well and the understanding is improving

7885862 if my mom proposed it i maybe id sign it for my mom because i respect her
7885863 but not even for a brother would i sign something i didnt understand
7885864 it is tyrannical to compel a man to pay for the promulgation of ideas with which he does not agree

7885871 eso lo hacemos siempre son vacas de descarte que ya cumplieron su ciclo y que no la podemos vender al precio que se consigue en cualquier carnicer a por esos animales nos ofrecen 1 20 cuando se est comprando entre y 5 y 6 pesos entonces nos conviene consumir nuestros propios animales
7885872 my job as president is to make sure we are tightening the screws on iran diplomatically to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a different calculation
7885873 and we have got to do that before israel feels like its back is against the wall
7885874 we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
7885875 the problem is that for most of the bush administration instead of trying to engage directly with iran there was a lot of saber rattling
7885876 the net effect of demanding preconditions that iran rejects is this we get no results and iran gets closer to the bomb he said in a july media statement
7885877 the single greatest strength america has in the middle east
7885878 i am a zionist you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
7885879 finally after years of peace now causing strife and dissention in our society it finally brings israel some good news
7885880 peace now is not perfectly accurate the construction is private and not government funded it is within the towns borders and not expansion and is much less widespread than the report states and the main point is that it is much less than is necessary
7885881 as usual the extreme left wing ignores some fundamental facts one the demand for apartments in judea and samaria is strong consistent and growing two the future of israel lies only in the development of israels only remaining lands the samarian hills the biblical birthplace of the jewish nation
7885882 the press is granting free publicity to peace now but like bilam of the bible he wished to curse us but ended up blessing us
7885883 israel is erasing the green line the separation between pre 1967 israel and judea samaria ed by intensive construction designed to create contiguity between settlement blocs and isolated settlements the jewish presence often extends up to the edges of palestinian cities continuing this policy will make it impossible to separate between the israelis and the palestinians
7885884 i will not allow the talks to be harmed by the settlements the peace process need not be affected by the settlements we are talking now about the borders of a palestinian state we have been talking about settlements for more than 40 years its part of the negotiations i understand that this is a frustrating issue for the palestinians but even when there was terrorism i didnt let that affect the negotiations just a year ago there was much terrorism but now were at a point of hope
7885885 i dont think anyone has been trying to bring pressure to bridge the gaps what weve been trying to do is to help the parties see how their own conversations might converge
7885886 obviously there is more that needs to be done both sides continue to have work to do
7885887 it is something that abu mazen pa chairman mahmoud abbas brings up each time we meet it is something that matters a lot to the palestinian people
7885888 men of jihad this is your festive season since jihad in a state of fasting has a particularly delectable taste for the believers wonderful it is to delight in the breaking of the fast and to taste the killing of infidels to delight in the sound of the wailing of tyrants and lowly degenerates ramadan is a month of fighting of self sacrifice of military victories of the victory of religion and the humiliation of the infidels the most courageous and finest forays took place in ramadan
7885889 the pre military academies are a zionist and principled enterprise of the first degree
7885890 the best idf officers and commanders come from the mechinot
7885891 the cooperation affection and respect between the religious and non religious leaders of the mechina movement is something that should be emulated in the rest of the country it is simply outstanding and truly and not just as a turn of phrase one for all and all for one specific examples abound
7885892 to keep the hamas movement at arms length in order to contain it
7885893 this is the middle easts cold war in which states that are divided along ideological lines are not likely to restore unity until major systemic changes are brought about
7885894 efforts to reconcile palestinian factions should not be abandoned however lasting peace in the middle east cannot be achieved with two rival palestinian mini states in place
7885895 should we listen to these wise figures who see the world in black and white or should we continue dialogue without discrimination even sitting down at the same table as al qaeda leader osama bin laden
7885896 the only force we have ever had is that of words
7885897 we talked to hamas and hizbullah and other islamist organizations we talked to the most diverse groups in kosovo because they clearly expressed the legitimate interests of the population
7885898 by doing this we did not legitimize their methods but pushed them towards ending violence
7885899 i promise we wont rest until we bring about the release of all the prisoners
7885900 despite the great happiness we know that there is also sadness over those who were left behind 11 000 who have yet to be released
7885901 they all have a place in our hearts but there is a special one senior brother marwan barghouti and the leading brother ahmad saadat whom we hope to see soon
7885902 the united states says jewish settlements in the occupied west bank threaten any peace between israel and the palestinians yet it also encourages americans to help support settlers by offering tax breaks on donations
7885903 either they stop the settlements or they stop talking about a two state solution
7885904 well what are you going to do today to celebrate your anniversary
7885905 our trendsetters are very hip and aware but they are far from experts
7885906 our aim was to discover which companies are going beyond the niche market of hard core greenies and winning over the more broadly influential members of this generation
7885907 now the global thought leader is defined less by what culture he enjoys than by the smartphone social bookmarking site social network and e mail provider he uses to store and transmit it
7885908 this transition has produced some new status rules in the first place prestige has shifted from the producer of art to the aggregator and the appraiser inventors artists and writers come and go but buzz is forever maximum status goes to the gladwellian heroes who occupy the convergence points of the internet infosystem web sites like pitchfork for music gizmodo for gadgets bookforum for ideas etc these tastemakers surf the obscure niches of the culture market bringing back fashion forward nuggets of coolness for their throngs of grateful disciples
7885909 the cost of shipping a 40 foot container from shanghai to the united states has risen to 8 000 compared with 3 000 early in the decade according to a recent study of transportation costs big container ships the pack mules of the 21st century economy have shaved their top speed by nearly 20 percent to save on fuel costs substantially slowing shipping times

7885914 quando as coisas est o indo bem f cil que todos ao seu redor coloquem os bra os em seus ombros para dizer que voc o n mero um e ent o repentinamente quando voc enfrenta uma situa o dif cil dizem que j um piloto acabado n o o caso
7885915 ele o campe o mundial somos uma equipe claro que vamos apoiar todos na equipe e acima de tudo kimi porque confiamos 100 nele ele vem enfrentando momentos dif ceis mas precisamos continuar unidos n o temos nenhuma d vida em rela o performance de kimi e tenho certeza que ele vai se recuperar entre agora e o final no brasil
7885916 quando voc um piloto antes de tudo realmente capaz de olhar para dentro e entender o que est indo bem e o que est dando errado e com certeza neste momento n s temos de trabalhar juntos e entender como o nosso lado pode melhorar e ajudar e novamente como eu disse antes tenho certeza que ele est totalmente comprometido e voltar a andar bem no final porque quer mostrar que o campe o mundial acreditem em mim
7885917 claro que este um problema que nestas condi es tira um pouco o nosso sono
7885918 se voc n o termina as corridas tudo fica dif cil em um campeonato t o apertado perde se pontos em ambas as classifica es por falta de confiabilidade
7885919 a nica coisa que podemos fazer trabalhar duro e tentar entender qual a raz o para estas falhas o que temos de fazer continuar lutando porque por outro lado vimos o retorno de uma tima performance do carro e isso o que queremos ainda estamos no campeonato mas a diferen a existe vamos for ar ao m ximo at o final
7885920 os engenheiros estavam cientes de um risco potencial em termos gerais com o motor 056 instalado no carro de kimi que estava em sua segunda corrida j que as bielas faziam parte do mesmo lote usado no motor de felipe
7885921 trocar o motor do carro de kimi teria o for ado a largar mais atr s em uma pista onde as ultrapassagens pareceram imposs veis provando que n o suficiente levar a f rmula 1 para um circuito de rua em um local fant stico para produzir corridas espetaculares
7885922 youre making money on the one side and spending it on the other

7885925 meta materials are artificial materials with versatile properties that can be tailored to fit almost any practical need
7885926 similar to general relativity where time and space are curved transformation optics shows that the space for light can also be bent in an almost arbitrary way
7885927 if youre out on the battlefield and you see a cloud coming or you suspect there might be an aerosol chemical or biological warfare being used against you its very difficult to quickly detect what the material is
7885928 so this would be an enormous an enormous improvement and not just on the battlefield but it would allow us to make all kinds of materials what we call nanomanufacturing
7885929 which could go into electronic and optical devices that youd use from night vision goggles to distance sensors to other kinds of sensors
7885930 one of the most exciting applications is an electromagnetic cloak that can bend light around itself similar to the flow of water around a stone
7885931 making invisible both the cloak and an object hidden inside

7885937 a partir da ado o do trabalho em turnos fixos o empregado pode planejar de acordo com suas prefer ncias uma rotina di ria regular sem se preocupar com a variabilidade dos hor rios

7885941 assim se uma empresa que adotava o turno de revezamento passa a adotar o turno fixo ela no meu entender est atendendo ao reclamo da sociedade quilo que o legislador pretendeu isto o oferecimento de condi es de trabalho melhores do ponto de vista biol gico da higiene da seguran a do trabalho e social e familiar
7885942 quando achamos ter todas as respostas a vida vem e muda todas as perguntas
7885943 o viver um dia de cada vez aten o aqui agora
7885944 i did a tremendous amount of research for both the first and second season of mad men i used ebay a lot to order books and vintage magazines like look life and ladies home journal i designed the looks for the secretaries of sterling cooper from sears catalogs and new york newspaper clippings from 1959 to 1962 i also asked members of my own family to send me photos from that period those were priceless
7885945 because of the fluorescent lights in sterling cooper i didnt use any lipsticks or nail polish colors that had blue undertones they popped out too much on film i wanted everyone to look natural i stuck to true reds true pinks and true corals
7885946 bettys look is inspired from a book on grace kelly classic perfection for joans character i used a very famous red headed model from that era by the name of suzy parker as inspiration and for peggy i looked to famous young actresses like annette funicello to capture her naivet
7885947 i pay special attention to bettys lips so when she speaks she feels like shes being heard
7885948 it surprises us that mattel chose to direct facebook to take down scrabulous without waiting for the indian courts decision
7885949 mattels action speaks volumes about their business practices and respect for the judiciary
7885950 my impression is that attorney santos called you precisely because you are the brother of justice sabio and not because of your concern for the members of the gsis
7885951 first time that attorney santos had called you to intercede in behalf of the government in cases pending before the court of appeals
7885952 as a lawyer did it not occur to you that there must be something wrong somewhere when attorney santos called you that a tro is prepared did you not consider it unusual
7885953 but you are a lawyer you are a practicing lawyer even during the marcos era the tro is known to attorney santos when he is not a member of the court of appeals did you not inquire from attorney santos how he came to know about the tro
7885954 you said you are not lobbying but you are trying to influence your brother
7885955 rely upon the merits of his cause and refrain from any impropriety which tends to influence or gives the appearance of influencing the court
7885956 it seems you are making these things an exception to many things you called your brother for this case even if you are bordering into something that is unethical and downright illegal you did not even think you are obstructing justice
7885957 my brother do not hesitate calling me because he was five years older then me we respect him he helped me find a career in the judiciary i owe him a debt of gratitude
7885958 because of my respect for him and his respect for me he never insisted i dont know why he is being faulted now
7885959 are you saying it is alright for a brother to call you up in connection with a case pending before the court of appeals as long as you will decide accordingly is that what you are saying
7885960 is that not dangerous relying on filipino culture in situations like this
7885961 i will be a hypocrite if i will not say what i said he is my brother if there will be consequences then so be it
7885962 the mounting pressures caused by the controversy your honors has imploded my health and resulted in my heart condition and other maladies
7885963 we are excited about this acquisition the strategic combination of our groups will accelerate the realisation of our common aspiration to become the most respected provider of business transformational services in the global marketplace
7885964 against the background of the global economic environment and increasing consolidation in the it services industry the combination with infosys represents a compelling proposition
7885965 while the fits good and the price seems reasonable the rest is all about how well infosys can execute on the integration
7885966 the disappointing results we have seen over the past few weeks at the beginning of our most critical quarter indicate we will fall substantially short of our expectations for 2008
7885967 we are no longer on track to deliver our targets
7885968 the dollar index has shown that it can at time override the oil fundamentals and will probably dominate until gustav defines a more definitive path
7885969 nel campo della politica estera tradizionalmente spesso ci sono delle convergenze tra maggioranza e opposizione quindi come altre volte abbiamo condiviso la relazione del ministro frattini che stata molto ampia ha toccato molti punti soprattutto sul ruolo dell ue e dell italia

7885989 we find ourselves at a critical place with kids eating and physical activity habits
7885990 our hope is that once schools receive the successful students school designation they will use the feedback from the scorecard to continue to make positive changes in these areas we have two and three times more overweight and obese kids in our state today than we did 20 years ago and its not going to get better unless we all work together families schools and communities to make sure kids get plenty of activity and eat balanced diets
7885991 they need to be active and eat well while they are there so they can feel good and do well in school studies show this to be true it just makes sense we all need to work to make sure this happens
7885992 recent rainfall in some parts of the state along with the warm summer weather provides ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes
7885993 mosquitoes can be more than just a nuisance they can also make people seriously ill now is the time to fight the bite
7885994 you can make your backyard a whole lot less mosquito friendly by getting rid of any containers that hold water that will take away mosquito breeding grounds
7885995 take a good look at your yard to spot potential problem areas
7885996 things like bird baths old tires planters toys and even small containers like tin cans can give mosquitoes a place to thrive cover rain barrels with tight fitting screening and clean out birdbaths at least twice a week

7885999 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe

7886021 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7886022 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7886023 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
7886024 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk

7886068 when we updated our website and our online channel platforms last year as part of the process of making dubai bank a fully ethical and institution it became clear that we needed to increase the levels of security we offered our clients to protect both them and ourselves from the risks and threats associated with password and id theft we spent much time researching the possibilities and decided to deploy a two factor authentication solution to our corporate customers as a first step
7886069 having made the decision to use 2fa we conducted an extensive review of all the solutions on the market looking at the price performance product quality and security aspects of the market leaders in the end the cryptocard solution proved to be the logical choice for us
7886070 we found the cryptocard 2fa system to be the most flexible and suited to our purpose
7886071 rapid integration with our microsoft based infrastructure and our existing banking applications and the ability to scale right up to a million users were also key factors in our decision
7886072 we are really pleased to be working with dubai bank to secure access to their on line banking systems it is yet another example of how important the internet is to trading and how 2fa reduces the risks for both the bank and its customers
7886073 not only does this relationship increase our footprint in the middle east but it once again proves that our flexibility and the quality of our product provide the best solution for banks looking for the highest levels of security and best possible total cost of ownership

7886077 a mi querido roberto despu s de leer los diarios esta tarde por la internet
7886078 ya fuera de bio tica y oh dolor las minifaldas
7886079 yo no propondr a un debate institucional sobre casi ning n tema pero en el de la impunidad s
7886080 son cad veres y cad veres y las relaciones de la polic a con el narco y etc tera pero no permite el debate se condena y punto
7886081 lo que s permite el debate son las estructuras de la impunidad
7886082 insistir en que el poder legislativo los medios electr nicos y las universidades tengan una actitud porque es el nico tema que permitir a testimonios y de alg n modo reflexiones colaterales sobre lo que m s nos importa
7886083 debe frenarse con la acci n de la justicia que detenga el narcotr fico los polic as involucrados los empresarios y pol ticos pero esto se ha dicho en demas a y no ha pasado nada
7886084 al lado de las acciones del poder judicial es un debate nacional de primer orden sobre la estructura de la impunidad y creo que al lado de la cumbre de seguridad debe darse la cumbre alternativa
7886085 en el mundo de los negocios en el universo bancario en la red judicial en el disfrute de los ecocidios en los tratos inquilinarios en el saqueo interminable a los pobres qu es la impunidad trat ndose de las corporaciones policiacas del laberinto de los jefes policiacos de los nexos con los narcotraficantes de la ligereza con que se ejecutan los asesinatos en serie qu es la impunidad en el mundo laboral con la guillotina del salario m nimo o de los contratos de riesgo o las esclavitudes de la maquila
7886086 la generalizaci n es injusta sobre todo si se trata de la polic a uniformada sometida a una serie de abusos donde figuran los salarios bajos
7886087 no todo es desastre y prueba irrefutable de ello es el n mero de polic as asesinados cada a o en el cumplimiento del deber como los soldados tambi n victimados por la delincuencia estos polic as han servido a la sociedad y a partir de esto han pertenecido a ella si no se reconoce el sentido de su muerte se dar por sentado que el pa s vivir mejor sin un solo polic a lo que no parece ser lo apropiado

7886104 el mejor modo de ser arquitecto como dir a bernard rudofsky autor de arquitectura sin arquitectos es no ser arquitecto sino evolucionar desde otras situaciones y otros ambientes
7886105 me result extra o el cambio de cultura sobre todo lo diferente que era el tempo en el sur de europa las cosas requieren maduraci n tambi n trabaj en el estudio de enric miralles aquel fue el periodo formativo m s importante de mi carrera creo que la arquitectura espa ola actual tiene rasgos distintivos que la hacen nica es reconocible en su materialidad en la condici n portante de su estructura en la verdad de sus detalles adem s todav a permanece viva la l nea docente desde maestro hasta el aprendiz se puede seguir esa trayectoria que va de gaud a la joven arquitectura catalana pasando por miralles a trav s de albert viaplana ocurre algo parecido en madrid y sevilla
7886106 cuando en 2001 julien de smedt ahora jds y yo fundamos plot
7886107 jacobsen fue quien introdujo la modernidad en dinamarca pero siempre como una traducci n en el royal hotel de copenhague emple el mismo lenguaje que som ya hab a utilizado en la lever house de nueva york en sus piezas de mobiliario su vocabulario proven a de los eames podr amos decir que no aport nada nuevo en cambio lo que me interesa de utzon fue la apropiaci n de las formas de otras culturas y su transposici n a nuevos lugares las pagodas las pir mides escalonadas son formas potentes que pueden servir en multitud de emplazamientos un edificio que planteamos para suecia y que no funcion lo hemos reconvertido en un hotel con centro deportivo y de congresos para la exposici n mundial de shanghai 2010 adem s luego nos enteramos de que su forma se corresponde con el pictograma chino que significa gente por eso ahora lo llamamos peoples building
7886108 cuando nuestro cliente nos plante un hotel y centro de congresos en el aeropuerto de arlanda estocolmo intentamos darle la vuelta al tradicional edificio de torre que sobresale de z calo y pensamos que el camino ser a una base alta fina y estrecha con una gran plataforma encima no hubo manera pero seguimos d ndole vueltas cedimos en que el prisma saliera del suelo pero no con planta cuadrada sino triangular en cada una de sus caras planteamos un recorte de ventanas que desde lejos diera la impresi n de gigantescos retratos a lo warhol de cada uno de los tres pr ncipes de suecia es como si la familia real viniera a recibirte o a despedirte cuando ense amos nuestro trabajo en emiratos rabes con motivo de la presentaci n de otro proyecto esta idea le gust tanto al califa de turno que nos propuso que hici ramos lo mismo con un retrato suyo para un edificio en el desierto
7886109 las razones dadas en este libro pueden chocar con los sentimientos religiosos de algunas personas
7886110 si una idea no funciona en un sitio ir buscando acomodo en otros proyectos hasta que termine por concretarse
7886111 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7886112 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7886113 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7886114 art is by nature and most artists are extremists im also an extremist i simply choose the other extreme and at a time when artists of all sorts are allowed and even expected to do the stuff everyone else just wishes they could get away with my extreme feels almost naughty antiestablishment aberrant i like being a chemical free overdisciplined ball of morning person enthusiasm

7886121 this is especially true among the lower class majority of the upper middle class say they expect no change in their purchasing power
7886122 people are really downgrading theyre switching to the cheaper brand of cigarette and cheaper brand of household items some respondents in our qualitative surveys even said they are switching to the cheaper telco to cut on mobile phone expenses
7886123 this is the reality these are true not just in the provinces but also in metro manila it means that families are really being forced to cut back on education to focus on the three basic necessities which are food clothing and shelter

7886126 a cita o de quem praticou o ato irregular portanto uma exig ncia legal neste caso e em todos os que se anularem contratos de trabalho irregulares com a administra o p blica
7886127 ainda que o empregador seja um rg o da administra o p blica isto pouco importa j que a discuss o envolve a exist ncia de um contrato de trabalho e n o uma rela o estatut ria a rela o havida entre as partes trabalhista embora parcialmente nula por isso incide com toda a sua for a o art 114 da cf que supera e impede qualquer argumenta o com base em lei ordin ria

7886146 im just happy to have scored in a premier league game for everton it doesnt matter if its the first game or the last game
7886147 but it was more important to get the win and this is the start for us now the defending was excellent and when we got our chances we took them
7886148 were still a good team everyone can comment on the need to bring players in but thats out of our hands

7886155 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun
7886156 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7886157 kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7886158 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it

7886167 this pleasure comes precisely from the sharpest awareness of your own degradation from the knowledge that you have gone to the utmost limit that it is despicable yet cannot be otherwise that you no longer have any way out that you will never be a different man that even if there were still time and faith enough to change yourself you probably would not even wish to change and if you wished you would do nothing about it anyway because in fact there is perhaps nothing to change to
7886168 the truth is they are downright stupid and naive they have no sensitivity to beauty and art and music and love and all the subtle things in life but for the congruities of mathematics and order
7886169 ultimately we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it so i think it fair to say that by any conventional measure a mere seven years after my graduation day i had failed on an epic scale an exceptionally short lived marriage had imploded and i was jobless a lone parent and as poor as it is possible to be in modern britain without being homeless the fears my parents had had for me and that i had had for myself had both come to pass and by every usual standard i was the biggest failure i knew now i am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun that period of my life was a dark one and i had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution i had no idea how far the tunnel extended and for a long time any light at the end of it was a hope rather than a reality so why do i talk about the benefits of failure simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential i stopped pretending to myself that i was anything other than what i was and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me had i really succeeded at anything else i might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena i believed i truly belonged i was set free because my greatest fear had already been realised and i was still alive and i still had a daughter whom i adored and i had an old typewriter and a big idea and so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which i rebuilt my life you might never fail on the scale i did but some failure in life is inevitable it is impossible to live without failing at something unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all in which case you fail by default failure gave me an inner security that i had never attained by passing examinations failure taught me things about myself that i could have learned no other way i discovered that i had a strong will and more discipline than i had suspected i also found out that i had friends whose value was truly above rubies the knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are ever after secure in your ability to survive you will never truly know yourself or the strength of your relationships until both have been tested by adversity such knowledge is a true gift for all that it is painfully won and it has been worth more to me than any qualification i ever earned given a time machine or a time turner i would tell my 21 year old self that personal happiness lies in knowing that life is not a check list of acquisition or achievement your qualifications your cv are not your life though you will meet many people of my age and older who confuse the two life is difficult and complicated and beyond anyones total control and the humility to know that will enable you to survive its vicissitudes
7886170 there are no proactive women here that i see hence women are simply not proactive
7886171 hey i stand by what i feel about language that my liberty to feel this way is more important than the stamp of your institution than the heart and mind that have died somewhere over the course of one year in the passion that i silently put in that you were too insensitive to even notice or care about

7886176 we will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that perpetrators are brought to justice and be punished accordingly our children remain our priority and their future the focus of our development efforts anyone who wants to derail our goal for our children will have to face the full force of the law hardly a day passes by without one reading in the newspapers about one form of abuse exploitation or violence perpetrated against a child in one part of the country or the other
7886177 sometimes betrayal of childrens trust even goes deeper as it is often the adults entrusted with the case and the protection of children who perpetrate and permit this intolerable abuse or exploitation that is adults who use their positions power prestige and authority to sexually abuse and exploit children children who are abused or exploited find their world upside down as it makes enemies out of the very people children look up to for protection their self esteem confidence and trust are undermined and dented
7886178 you as children have an important role to play in national development as you have rights which go along with responsibilities

7886233 it is very easy for us to take the eyes off the electricity distribution industry and concentrate on the generation side but we have a time bomb ticking in the distribution sector
7886234 the electricity distribution industry edi restructuring process has been very slow we still dont have finality on the legislation required for edi restructuring and im actually more concerned on the distribution side of the business than i am actually on the generation side of the business
7886235 a distribution summit that was held a few months ago indicated that there is a backlog of some r20 billion where is that money going to come from
7886236 it is clear that operational and maintenance conditions and the key support planning issues are significantly influenced and impacted by the insufficient competent staffing levels

7886245 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7886246 what i understand is that the iraqi parliament will not pass this agreement
7886247 at this moment the iraqi government and parliament are not ready for such a deal which will face a lot of hurdles
7886248 we cannot sign an agreement unless it will preserve the sovereignty and national interests of iraq
7886249 any foreign soldiers on iraqi soil must have a specific time frame and not be open ended and iraqi blood must be protected and cannot grant full immunity
7886250 we assure you that nothing will be concealed and that we are at the beginning of the restoration of our full rights and sovereignty and the aspirations of the agreement and security arrangement will be presented to the parliament

7886275 the best way to prevent west nile virus is to prevent mosquito bites
7886276 the more time you spend outdoors the more chance you have of being bitten by an infected mosquito we encourage everyone to take precautions against west nile while recreating outside this summer and as we move into early fall last year we were still registering human cases into october
7886277 recent rainfall in some parts of the state along with the warm summer weather provides ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes
7886278 mosquitoes can be more than just a nuisance they can also make people seriously ill now is the time to fight the bite
7886279 you can make your backyard a whole lot less mosquito friendly by getting rid of any containers that hold water that will take away mosquito breeding grounds
7886280 we listened carefully to what doctors nurses hospital administrators and patients had to say
7886281 by making a few changes we were able to address several of those issues while remaining confident that were protecting patients
7886282 as with other surgeries its important that doctors and their hospitals repeat procedures often enough to do every one of them well
7886283 based on our research we concluded that a minimum of 300 would be practical for hospitals and also protect patients
7886284 obesity is an increasing problem with 66 percent of the adults in the united states being overweight or obese
7886285 in germany 50 percent of the adult population is overweight while gaining too much weight can present health risks its even more dangerous to have the abdominal type of obesity people should measure their waistline from time to time and avoid the accumulation of abdominal fat
7886286 if the waist to hip ratio values were greater than 97 for men and 84 for women then individuals faced almost eight times increased risk for stroke compared to individuals with a whr less than 0 92 in men or less than 0 78 in women
7886287 by using different statistical approaches it was confirmed that waist to hip ratio appeared to be the strongest predictor of stroke and tia risk
7886288 this was a strong trend but not statistically significant and will require further research
7886289 physicians should measure patients waistlines and use the waist to hip ratio to estimate stroke risk world health organization defined categories of whr or waist circumference should be used doctors should also consider the whole vascular risk profile to minimize or modify all possible factors contributing to coronary heart disease stroke and peripheral artery disease
7886290 physical activity was much more common in the controls than in the stroke and tia patients
7886291 for example a mediterranean diet containing fish and olive oil can lower your risk of coronary heart disease and possibly also lower stroke risk

7886386 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as i am concerned thats the end of the matter
7886387 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7886388 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7886389 allegations of this nature are of course highly defamatory and they were particularly offensive to the claimant because they are simply not true
7886390 in fact as a number of his protection officers volunteered to testify in the event that this matter came to trial sir salman conducted himself with dignity and courtesy throughout a time of great personal danger and concern
7886391 they are also here to apologise unequivocally to sir salman rushdie as well as ms west for the hurt and damage which they have suffered as a result of the publication of these allegations
7886392 in view of sir salman rushdies belief in free expression he has uniquely in a british libel action not sought damages nor has sir salman asked for any opinions in the book to be altered only that the false and defamatory content be taken out
7886393 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers to an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
7886394 i am very gratified by the outcome it seems to me to have been an avoidable business the facts were not checked before publishing these allegations
7886395 my interest was solely to establish the truth over the number of serious allegations about myself elizabeth west and indeed about the behaviour of the police force
7886396 stand up in the high court and own up to being a liar
7886397 i hope it will be an original and new method by which to establish facts rather than going for enormous financial damages

7886416 la poblaci n se defend a establecimos contactos con ellos y les guiamos el movimiento de protesta de estudiantes e intelectuales incluidos cat licos y budistas se extend a cuando la gente vio que nuestros m todos eran efectivos se unieron a nosotros
7886417 yo estaba all aquellos destructores que durante m s de hora y media a mil pies de profundidad con las luces apagadas observando todo lo que hac an pod a escuchar sus habladur as por la radio el maddox y el joy parec an tener algo intermitente en sus objetivos de radar me atrev a salir all y me dirig hacia donde pensaba que estaba el barco e intentar asesinarlos si ellos no lo hac an pero fue in til baj all y no hab a nada
7886418 en represalia por este ataque no provocado en alta mar nuestras fuerzas han atacado las bases utilizadas por las patrullas navales norvietnamitas
7886419 su objetivo el de china no es simplemente vietnam del sur es asia su objetivo no es el cumplimiento del nacionalismo vietnamita es erosionar y desacreditar la capacidad de eeuu de ayudar a evitar el dominio chino de toda asia
7886420 los chinos quer an que les entreg ramos todo el equipamiento militar para vietnam en la frontera chino sovi tica y que china despu s se lo pasar a a los vietnamitas descubrimos m s tarde que los chinos no estaban entregando nada parte del equipamiento descargado se lo quedaban ellos
7886421 lo que me sorprendi fue que pod amos enviar los misiles antia reos m s modernos a egipto un pa s capitalista pero no a vietnam nuestros comandantes sol an decir que era porque exist a el peligro de que cayeran en manos de los chinos
7886422 la batalla en ia drang fue nuestra primera gran victoria llegamos a la conclusi n de que pod amos luchar contra los norteamericanos y ganar la clave era obligar a los norteamericanos a luchar como nosotros quer amos es decir cuerpo a cuerpo
7886423 una noche contamos 14 ca ones de artiller a que enrojec an e iluminaban todo el cielo con sus explosiones eran como los fuegos artificiales nocturnos en han i constantemente conduc amos a trav s de las balas y el humo
7886424 cada vez estaba m s claro que el presidente johnson iba a tener que elegir entre perder vietnam del sur o intentar salvarlos introduciendo una fuerza militar norteamericana y ocupar una parte importante del pa s de la misi n de combate
7886425 si hay un muerto y es un vietnamita entonces es del vietcong
7886426 a las ocho de la ma ana del 23 de marzo les atacamos nuestra artiller a destruy la fuerza a rea matamos no s lo a algunos guardias sino tambi n al intendente norteamericano nuestra unidad de mando tambi n atac la escuela de entrenamiento policial asesinamos a muchos oficiales bien entrenados mientas ellos miraban el movimiento
7886427 primero me gustar a dejar claro que estos ataques a reos no pretenden ser amenaza alguna a la china comunista en realidad no representan ninguna amenaza para ese pa s creemos que pek n sabe que eeuu no busca extender la guerra de vietnam
7886428 yo sol a ir al dormitorio del presidente a las 7 de la ma ana cada ma ana l estaba al tel fono con una diferencia de doce horas comprobando las bajas del d a anterior sr presidente perdimos 18 hombres ayer sr presiente perdimos 160 hombres tuvimos 400 bajas as una ma ana tras otra
7886429 esta guerra confusa ha hecho estragos en los destinos de nuestros hogares a pesar de las d biles protestas ante el contrario las promesas de una gran sociedad han desaparecido en los campos de batalla de vietnam la persecuci n de esta guerra amplia ha estrechado las dimensiones prometidas de los programas de bienestar dom sticos ha hecho que el pobre blanco o negro soporte las cargas m s pesadas tanto en el frente como en casa
7886430 cuando volv as del afn ve as los disturbios en las calles y en cualquier sitio a los chicos gritando te dec as espera un minuto
7886431 la intensidad la coordinaci n y el ritmo de los ataques no se anticiparon completamente
7886432 los taxis llevaban crisantemos a saig n para el mercado tet ocultos debajo de ellos iban los ak 47 la poblaci n apoyaba la revoluci n nos ayudaban ramos capaces de atravesar la seguridad de la ciudad cambiamos nuestras ropas y llev bamos documentos de identidad falsos la gente de saig n nos ocultaba en sus casas
7886433 dicen que el viet cong ya no es capaz de controlar las ciudades y probablemente sea cierto pero ellos han demostrado que a pesar de todos nuestros informes de avance de fortaleza del gobierno y de la debilidad del enemigo medio mill n de soldados norteamericanos con 700 000 aliados vietnamitas con el dominio total por aire y mar apoyados por los enormes recursos y las armas m s modernas somos incapaces de controlar incluso una sola ciudad de los ataques de un enemigo cuya fuerza total es aproximadamente de 250 000
7886434 para nosotros no existe algo parecido a una nica estrategia la nuestra siempre es una s ntesis simult neamente militar pol tica y diplom tica por esa raz n claramente la ofensiva tet ten a m ltiples objetivos
7886435 en lo sucesivo no importa lo efectiva que sea nuestra acci n la estrategia prevaleciente ya no puede conseguir sus objetivos dentro de un per odo dado ni dentro de los niveles de fuerza pol ticamente aceptables para el pueblo estadounidense
7886436 yo me hago preguntas como cu ndo termina la guerra bien no lo se cu ntos hombres piensa que podremos perder realmente no lo se despu s por ltimo escucho cu l es nuestro plan para ganar la guerra en vietnam no hay ninguna salida el plan era quedarse all con l y finalmente esperar a que el enemigo abandonara
7886437 quedarse all con l y finalmente esperar a que el enemigo abandonara
7886438 pero despu s lleg tet y su popularidad se hundi como si vietnam fuera una mecha ardiendo que de repente hab a iniciado una explosi n de disidencia
7886439 he renovado mi oferta hecha el pasado mes de agosto para detener el bombardeo de vietnam del norte pido que las conversaciones comiencen inmediatamente que sean unas conversaciones serias sobre la base de la paz
7886440 no buscar ni aceptar la nominaci n de mi partido para otro mandato como vuestro presidente
7886441 la historia se repite primero como tragedia y despu s como farsa
7886442 durante a os camboya la zona fronteriza de camboya y laos fue utilizada libremente por el enemigo pero debido a la pol tica de mi gobierno no podremos luchar la guerra abierta o desplegar abiertamente tropas tropas militares en estos pa ses
7886443 en una o dos ocasiones los jefes recomendaron una intervenci n militar norteamericana en vietnam del norte y dijeron que ellos reconoc an que esto podr a llevar a una respuesta militar china y o sovi tica en cuyo caso dec an tendr amos que considerar el uso de armas nucleares
7886444 el presidente estaba preocupado por china y rusia no sab a en corea nadie pensaba que los chinos fueran a traspasar el yalu con un mill n de hombres y nos pillaran por sorpresa recuerdo una y otra vez cuando los militares sugirieron minar el haiphong o enviar aviones de guerra para bombardear haiphong l dijo el infierno no alg n aviador maldito arrojar una bomba sobre una chimenea rusa y despu s tendr en mis manos la tercera guerra mundial
7886445 los soldados estadounidenses dispararon a todo lo que se mov a incluido ganado pollos p jaros y a n peor civiles los aldeanos no ofrecieron ninguna resistencia a n as los soldados lanzaron granadas de mano en las chozas dieron rdenes a gritos y asesinaron sin distinci n las atrocidades continuaron durante toda la ma ana murieron beb s ni os peque os y las mujeres fueron violadas a punta de pistola 500 civiles yac an muertos sobre el suelo pero su trabajo a n no hab a terminado despu s prendieron fuego a la aldea los cuerpos las casas la comida los suministros todo fue incendiado
7886446 si el presidente recomendara ayudar a vietnam aceptar a que su representante en el congreso aprobara la ayuda a vietnam en forma de comida o medicinas
7886447 la moral la disciplina y las condiciones de lucha de las fuerzas armadas son con pocas excepciones m s bajas que en cualquier otro momento de este siglo y quiz s inferiores a las que ha habido en toda la historia de eeuu
7886448 aunque ning n oficial de alto rango especialmente no mientras est de servicio abiertamente ha hecho una declaraci n similar las conclusiones

7886450 un soldado norteamericano destinado en cu chi es citado por
7886451 podr a ser una situaci n com n o incluso cierta
7886452 la cuesti n de negarse a combatir un eufemismo oficial para describir la negativa de ir a la batalla y que es el peor crimen que un soldado puede cometer recientemente volvi a reaparecer cuando el escuadr n b de la primera de caballer a en la frontera laosiana se neg a recuperar el veh culo de su capit n que conten a los c digos rdenes secretas y consejos de comunicaci n
7886453 buscar y evadir cuando una unidad en silencio evitaba la batalla es pr cticamente un principio ahora la expresi n gi para esto es cya c brete asno y vete a casa esa pr ctica de b squeda y evasi n no pasaba desapercibida para el enemigo y se ve a en el hecho de que la delegaci n del viet cong en las negociaciones de paz en par s declar las unidades comunistas en indochina han dicho que no se ataque a las unidades norteamericanas a menos que les provoquen
7886454 terry anderson de la universidad texas a amp m dijo que entre 1960 y 1973 hubo un aumento del fragging el ej rcito norteamericano no tiene estad sticas exactas sobre cu ntos oficiales murieron de esta manera pero conocen al menos 600 casos de fragging confirmado y otros 1 400 donde los oficiales murieron en circunstancias sospechosas como resultado de esta situaci n el ej rcito estadounidense a principios de 1970 no estaba en guerra con el enemigo sino que estaba en guerra consigo mismo
7886455 m s de 80 helic pteros aterrizaron para llevarse a los norteamericanos que quedaban adem s de a miles de vietnamitas incluido el anterior vicepresidente ky y los llev a barcos de la armada en el mar del sur de china los pilotos eran sacados del agua cuando se deshac an de sus helic pteros para dejar espacio para que aterrizaran m s miles de vietnamitas fueron evacuados en barcos de vung tau y otros abandonaron en avi n hacia tailandia y filipinas la salida final lleg con las rdenes de washington y ante la insistencia del presidente duong van minh a primera hora de la ma ana un helic ptero con 11 marines estadounidenses ayudaron a la evacuaci n que finalmente se retras por la explosi n de un peque o arsenal en la embajada de eeuu
7886456 la forma en la que se fueron los norteamericanos en s misma era un espect culo
7886457 la evacuaci n fue una escena fant stica cuando los helic pteros rug an en un cielo gris y plomizo algunas veces se ve an dos docenas desde saig n central y el aire estaba lleno del murmullo de sus aspas
7886458 el general cao van vien jefe del estado mayor y otros oficiales veteranos y pol ticos se les inform de que deb an abandonar la ciudad a bordo de helic pteros estadounidenses porque los norvietnamitas se acercaban para asesinarles
7886459 quieren ver apilados los m16 como una prueba de la rendici n

7886484 if any one saith that man is truly absolved from his sins and justified because that he assuredly believed himself absolved and justified or that no one is truly justified but he who believes himself justified and that by this faith alone absolution and justification are effected let him be anathema

7886565 the council has always had an ambitious and substantial capital investment programme including the rebuilding of exeters museum significant city centre enhancements and major investment in affordable housing
7886566 to fund completion of this years committed capital investment programme we would need to borrow up to 11 million and meet the cost of the borrowing from the revenue budget
7886567 over the next five years aggregate borrowing could reach around 30 million this is perfectly normal and has to be capable of being repaid from each years balanced revenue budget the principle is just like paying off a mortgage on a house
7886568 it is not a deficit on our budget just for comparison ipswich borough council has long term borrowing of 41 7 million gloucester city council 29 million and devon county council 613 million
7886569 what we have to do is to take account of all these factors and set each year a balanced revenue budget one where all our day to day net expenditure is covered by our annual income which comes from a variety of sources including government grant council tax interest on balances and other income such as car park charges commercial rents and a whole range of other fees and charges
7886570 the process we are in at the moment is considering what adjustments may have to be made to reach a balanced budget situation and at the moment it looks as if something up to 1million could have to be saved but there are many changing variables in this equation and no decisions have yet been made indeed final decisions do not have to be made by elected members until february next year when the 2009 10 budget will be set

7886586 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7886587 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7886588 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7886589 they dont like to get hot their body temperature is 102 34 celsius and they are wearing black leather jackets literally if turning north south would keep them cooler they would stand that way
7886590 nothing like this has been observed before in cattle or in any large animal
7886591 the study is based entirely on correlations to demonstrate conclusively that cattle have a magnetic sense some kind of experimental manipulation will eventually be needed
7886592 if they have evidence suggesting that mammals are using magnetic fields to orient their movements this is very cool
7886593 we have only in the last few years begun to understand the mechanisms underlying magnetic field orientation in birds and other smaller animals
7886594 at one point last year the question came up whether large animals could also sense the earths magnetic field or not but of course it is difficult or maybe impossible to do these studies in the lab
7886595 so the idea arose to look for other large mammals like cattle and hynek burda was fascinated when he recognized that cattle could be found on google earth satellite images
7886596 its working exactly the way it is supposed to do
7886597 a 36 year old man has received serious injuries and was taken immediately to the university hospital of north tees where he is now in a stable condition
7886598 im not in a position at this stage to disclose the nature of his injuries however our initial enquiries would suggest a weapon was used in the assault
7886599 as a result specialist search teams have combed the surrounding area looking for any evidence relating to the incident
7886600 this enquiry is still in the very early stages and i am keen to speak to anyone who may have any information they should contact police as soon as possible
7886601 hes got a lot to prove to me i f i had to base my vote on how his supporters have treated us id be voting for mccain
7886602 more moderate growth in display advertising was partially offset by continued weakness in online recruitment advertising
7886603 for sure there has been interest from various parties within the gulf there is a precedent in the cases of aston martin ferrari or daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions
7886604 i was taking it and was in that groove and took advantage of it
7886605 i havent changed anything about me im just really healthy right now
7886606 this is the healthiest ive been around here and im just taking advantage of what they are giving me
7886607 the linemen up front are making big holes joe tonga rodney hudson and ryan mcmahon all those guys are making holes and i just was taking advantage of those holes and trying to get positive yards out of them
7886608 its very encouraging youve got a coach like rick trickett pushing those guys day in and day out those guys know what theyve got to do because theyve got trickett on their butts
7886609 to me personally it wasnt the best effort but i can build on something like that
7886610 its one of those runs where i should have taken it to the crib and i didnt so ill have to build on that and get better
7886611 he should have scored the second time its ridiculous that he didnt score
7886612 we have to get him in shape because something is going on that was a breakaway and when you are 4 3 you aint supposed to get caught he ran well but i thought he should have put that one in the endzone
7886613 when he came out that was the end of it for the offense
7886614 he made a comment in the past and i cannot tell you exactly when but he said he didnt believe a black should be a leader of this country
7886615 weve got two guys donald langley and brent vinson who will not travel because of the academic policy from last semester
7886616 they will not go to ucla its a class attendance violation
7886617 its great to get into a week where were working on itineraries travel squads game plans and have a chance to go against someone else we had a good day today i think were completely into our ucla preparation
7886618 well tighten some things that are very fixable from the kicking scrimmage on saturday and hopefully each day well take another step towards being ready to play
7886619 you try to keep them on a routine thats the reason we go out a day early so that they can get somewhat accustomed to it it would be different if we were playing at 8 p m out there when its 11 p m here but playing at five oclock that will keep their body clocks pretty much the same
7886620 weve made that haul a couple of times and its worked out last year it didnt work out so well but i dont think it was because of the travel or the time it was because we didnt take care of the ball didnt play the kicking game and didnt tackle
7886621 everyone is focused on their assignments we are not worried about whether or not someone is in game shape and stuff like that its about ucla fronts and coverages
7886622 i feel like it was a long camp but its bittersweet with it being my last one its good to get it out of the way and go play we play to play the game and not practice
7886623 i think he will be able to help hes fighting his own challenges with his shoulder but im hopeful hell be able to help us
7886624 youd like to have that veteran youd like to have jeff cottam there and then you really look good at tight end
7886625 better yet encode the bloody data before you shove it in there
7886626 do you honestly think that anybody who doesnt know how to use simple foolproof sql quoting functions is really going to be able to figure out how to correctly set up a package like this
7886627 why dont you try to actually learn to secure your code instead of being a lazy or completely unskilled administrator surely mysql real escape string isnt too hard to incorporate

7886654 they said if you dont voluntarily give up the dogs we will arrest you and put you in jail and charge a fine for each dog here
7886655 i equate this to living in one room of my house for all of my life and somebody just dropping groceries by once a week not a lot of stimulation
7886656 this is not what dogs were put on this planet for
7886657 how can you raise dogs without worming them and vaccinating them trimming their toenails and grooming them
7886658 we petted them and played with them and held them
7886659 they rode around on a golf cart with us they were very well socialized
7886660 some of them you put them on the ground and they dont know what it is because theyve lived their entire life on wire mesh
7886661 all the dogs had food and water in front of them at all times
7886662 you have to understand in an environment with four or five in a kennel theyre competing for food
7886663 you simply cant describe the overwhelming smell of the ammonia the feces
7886664 and these were kept decently clean but still the smell was just horrible
7886665 she was trying to care for the animals the best way she could but it was just impossible to care for that many dogs properly with the staff that the kennel had
7886666 these dogs have never been outside of that environment everything is new to them

7886685 one possible exception to console timing may be nintendo which could opt to upgrade the wii with faster processing power dvd capability and or greater storage
7886686 there is a certain improvement in this arena in the last few weeks the measures have been tightened but the results are still far from satisfying because there are still smuggling tunnels

7886718 the executive meetings should be called there have been important issues raised that should have been dealt with at the executive if that were not to take place there would be very serious consequences not only for the good governance of northern ireland but for those who would stop northern ireland being governed properly

7886732 experienced an inflight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7886733 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport at approximately 23 30 local french time
7886734 suddenly there was a roar of wind a rush of cold air the oxygen masks dropped you didnt know what was going on
7886735 no oxygen was delivered through the oxygen masks and i was surprised there seemed to be no communication between the pilot and the flight attendants because they didnt seem to know what to say and do
7886736 there was absolutely communication from the flight crew and that added to peoples extreme fear
7886737 passengers sometimes misunderstand they expect a surge of oxygen when in actual fact there is a steady stream of oxygen
7886738 the oxygen masks were working and the correct procedures were followed as soon as the captain got the plane down to 8000 ft he did make the appropriate announcement that they were going to divert to limoges for safety reasons
7886739 this is always a traumatic experience for passengers but the crew dealt with it appropriately

7886784 diy enlightenment is about finding your own version of truth peace and happiness
7886785 the guru or in the west the hermit used to have the monopoly on the enlightenment niche because information about enlightenment was not readily accessible and so it had to be transfered by direct verbal instruction then as the written word came about well these handwritten texts could only be in one place at a time so they naturally stayed in the gurus library and frankly it was good for business for the guru to have all info so this model was maintained for a long time even after crazy ideas like the printing press and whoa the interweb came about but dudes this system is just a clunky rusted artifact of the past never before has so much information been available so easily to so many people so while it may mean bad news for those in guru business there is no reason why an intelligent person such as yourself cant access and study all kinds of different viewpoints and realise your own version of enlightenment right there in your own home in your own time and by whichever method suits you because its not the method that matters its the result anyone who tells you that their method is the only way is either a cynical bullshit artist or is seriously self deluded and if you believe them well thats your decision we hope it works out for you
7886786 i was taught to desire nothing to swallow other peoples misery and to eat my own bitterness and even though i taught my daughter the opposite still she came out the same way maybe it is because she was born to me and she was born a girl and i was born to my mother and i was born a girl all of us like stairs one step after another going up going down but always going the same way no this cannot be this not knowing what youre worth this not begin with you my mother not know her worth until too late too late for her but not for me now we will see if not too late for you hmm

7886788 the main consideration for developers is that the interaction model does not lend itself to current thinking and development methodologies developing a gestural interface requires more than simply taking an existing application and trying to port it across instead gestural interface developers will need to stop forget the old practices and start thinking in a completely new way if an application is developed using this mindset the rewards will be great

7886793 building verification environments for both asic and fpga designs is a core competency of ours and using the tried and true vmm methodology enables us to quickly customize an optimal verification flow that helps us meet each of our customers unique requirements
7886794 by developing vmm compliant verification environments and supporting the verification flow with a complete set of user documentation we significantly improve efficiency for our customers by allowing them to focus on the task of verification without worrying about the implementation details
7886795 our adoption of the vmm methodology gives us the ability to build a structured robust verification environment that contributes to our pioneering work in the field of asic and ip design and verification for the networking computing automotive and industrial markets
7886796 pairing vmm with the design methodology we have employed successfully for over 20 years helps us drive a reuse philosophy as a result we have built up a valuable library of design and vmm compliant verification elements that allow us to develop technology for our customers in a timely cost effective manner
7886797 verilabs experience is that methodology standardization is one of the biggest challenges in verification even within a single client company
7886798 when that company has large development teams spread across several sites or countries deploying an effective methodology becomes absolutely crucial we have found that vmm can act as a key component in such a deployment and we have been using it to good effect over the past three years
7886799 the open source vmm base class library and applications are proven mature and deployed by hundreds of design teams across the globe making the vmm methodology the solution of choice for systemverilog based design and verification
7886800 innovative services companies are adopting vmm due to its ability to facilitate the easy deployment of robust reusable and highly configurable verification environments users and synopsys continue to enhance and expand vmm with new technologies such as the recently announced vmm lp which provides a verification methodology for low power designs

7886803 the impact of external forces on the industry will continue to be significant but the leading influencers will be radically different from those that affect the industry today technology will continue lead but other issues such as sustainability will migrate to near the top of the list
7886804 all new vehicles in 2020 will have some level of hybridization
7886805 even optimistic projections put only a small fraction of vehicle production migrating to this technology less than 1 percent of vehicles in the united states
7886806 lifestyle changes will allow access to luxury or larger vehicles during the weekends as an example while a small efficient vehicle will suffice for daily commuting needs
7886807 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave

7886882 a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law
7886883 it did not confer any right or legal status upon any baby not yet born this bill had no legal conflicts with roe v wade born and living survivors of abortion would be unambiguously considered persons medically scientifically empirically they were no different from the many premature babies who are born in american hospitals each year
7886884 this is probably not going to survive constitutional scrutiny number one whenever we define a pre viable fetus as a person that is protected by the equal protection clause or other elements in the constitution what were really saying is in fact that they are persons that are entitled to the kinds of protections that would be provided to a nine month old child that was delivered to term that determination then essentially if it was accepted by a court would forbid abortions to take place this would be an anti abortion statute
7886885 obama has also voted present again effectively a no vote on requiring parental notification not parental consent when minor children obtain abortions

7887024 domestic workers are dying in lebanon at a rate of more than one per week
7887025 these suicides are linked to the isolation and the difficult working conditions these workers face in lebanon
7887026 many domestic workers are literally being driven to jump from balconies to escape their forced confinement
7887027 suggest that forced confinement excessive work demands employer abuse and financial pressures are key factors pushing these women to kill themselves or risk their lives

7887037 ik vind dat the osbournes het publieke beeld van mijn vader heeft verpest door hem neer te zetten als een beetje een seniele grappige stuntelende man
7887038 mijn vader is geen idioot hij is naar mijn mening niets minder dan een genie
7887039 hij heeft fouten gemaakt maar we proberen een eerlijk beeld daarvan te schetsen
7887040 het is een homofobe reactie van de katholieke kerk die probeert te verstoppen dat er homoseksuele priesters bestaan
7887041 de beslissing van het vaticaan om een lichaam uit zijn rustplaats te halen is gravenschennis en religieuze ontheiliging het schendt de uitdrukkelijke wens van de kardinaal om voor eeuwig naast zijn geliefde te worden begraven na meer dan 100 jaar wil het vaticaan die rust verstoren zodat ze kunnen verbergen dat er kardinalen waren die mannen liefhadden het is een beschamend en onterend verraad van de homohatende kerk tegenover de kardinaal
7887042 het heropgraving past in een proces van canonisatie waarbij de overblijfselen van de kardinaal naar een plaats zullen gebracht worden waar pelgrims makkelijk naar toe kunnen om de heilige in wording te aanbidden
7887043 niemand betwist dat de kardinaal en de priester erg veel van elkaar hielden hij zei zelfs dat zijn verdriet na de dood van st john vergelijkbaar was met dat van een partner die haar of zijn partner verliest maar daarmee bedoelde hij niet dat het huwelijk hetzelfde is als een homoseksuele relatie het is fout om met de ogen van vandaag de teksten van toen te lezen de relaties in de victoriaanse tijd konden heel intens en passioneel zijn maar ze waren niet seksueel het celibaat werd gerespecteerd daar zijn heel veel bewijzen van

7887069 at 48 hour post eimd milk and milk based protein cho supplementation resulted in the attenuation of decreases in isokinetic muscle performance and increases in creatine kinase and myoglobin
7887070 this study supports the growing volume of literature which suggests that milk is a powerful post exercise recovery aid
7887071 previous research has shown milk to be an effective rehydration solution while this is the first study to suggest that drinking milk following muscle damaging exercise may decrease muscle damage
7887072 the results found that when consumed immediately after resistance based muscle damaging exercise both semi skimmed milk and milk based cho p helped to preserve more muscle than either the sports drink or water

7887078 an increase in some types of lung cancer and cancers of the upper respiratory tract such as throat and mouth cancer
7887079 contains cancer causing chemicals such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons carbonyls and benzene which cause mutations to dna in human cells
7887080 how much they used incense and collected detailed information on their lifestyle including their diet and how much they drank alcohol and smoked
7887081 325 had developed cancer of the upper respiratory tract and 821 had developed lung cancer
7887082 the small risk of developing upper respiratory tract cancers nearly doubled in people who used incense regularly
7887083 more common among women which could be explained by the fact that women tend to spend more time in the smoky home environment
7887084 it could be relevant for priests and others who are regularly exposed to incense but im not sure if a short term effect would be measurable
7887085 i would suggest that people use incense with caution if this study is confirmed i think regulation could be relevant
7887086 they want to see if there is any interest there
7887087 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7887088 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7887089 we are going to go forward with the players that we have

7887091 i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7887092 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7887093 as i know it he is probably on a beach somewhere sipping on some pina coladas so i doubt football is the first thing on his mind today
7887094 he has not been bouncing back and forth like favre
7887095 he has been pretty happy we saw him up here and he said he missed it but he was content he has decided to go on to the next phase of his life so i dont look too strongly into that him playing again
7887096 it is something that he all of us really wanted but obviously we didnt want these circumstances for him to get back
7887097 it is a good thing for him it is a good thing for this team he is definitely a d lineman at heart and hopefully he can just come back in and not miss a beat

7887105 organisations going for the informal approach can lack structure in their environmental policies and this can affect the level of success that they achieve in reducing both energy costs and co2 emissions
7887106 while computers may drive efficiency the data centres that run businesses are often far from efficient they are at the heart of environmental challenges created by it but the average retailer just does not have the necessary knowledge to bring about change they need specialist help and the actions we offer in our thought leadership initiatives are designed to illustrate how they can improve their carbon footprint and wider environmental position while also reducing operating costs and improving it service delivery

7887109 employers need to take some responsibility for the impact that overwork can have on their employees health with our research showing that a significant amount of it workers find it difficult to maintain relationships or suffer ill health the uks culture of working long hours needs to be addressed as businesses look to derive as much value from their people assets as possible during lean times it is going to be imperative that we dont drive employees to burnout
7887110 despite the predicted downturn we are still suffering a skills crisis so it is essential that we dont disillusion our skilled workers at a time when we need them most

7887139 the fact that yesterday the duma and today the russian president recognized south ossetia and abkhazia is inconsistent with my and i think our understanding of the principle of territorial integrity and is consequently absolutely not acceptable
7887140 todays announcement further inflames an already tense situation in the region we fully support georgias independence and territorial integrity which cannot be changed by decree from moscow
7887141 the fact that the russian governance now has chosen this path means that they have chosen a policy of confrontation not only with the rest of europe but also with the international community as a whole
7887142 regrettable and we reaffirm our attachment to georgias territorial integrity
7887143 for us south ossetia and abkhazia are parts of georgia
7887144 this of course only makes sense when it is based on common values
7887145 a true partnership requires shared values and those include respecting the territorial integrity of individual states as well as the use of international mechanisms to resolve conflicts

7887155 the inaugural mayors cup challenge match was a resounding success regardless of the final score of the match we had a fabulous experience in our sister city of dundee and a very successful trip on behalf of both alexandrias rugby team and its business community we feel that remploy frontlines support of alexandria rugby and the twinned cities programme will prove to be just as beneficial to our hometown as it is for dundee we look forward to building on what weve started over the years to come
7887156 remploy frontline is very proud to have been a part of this unique twinned city event we hope that our involvement in this programme encourages more businesses and organisations in both cities to look more closely at ways they can support the business and cultural exchanges based on remploy frontlines mission it would be great if alexandria and dundee can create more opportunities for otherwise disabled people and help further enrich their lives

7887177 georgi en oekra ne zullen leden worden van de navo
7887178 een balkanisatie op etnische basis van de kaukasus is een serieus gevaar voor ons allen
7887179 rusland te vragen om energie te leveren en open te staan voor investeringen
7887180 we wensen dat die in de richting van een veroordeling van de erkenning zal zijn
7887181 er bestaan nog obstakels maar die kunnen overwonnen worden indien er voldoende politieke wil bestaat
7887182 de russische erkenning gelijkaardig is met een verklaring dat rusland zuid osseti en abchazi niet zal annexeren

7887200 the arab regimes have implicitly or explicitly backed a range of terrorist groups
7887201 over time the stagnation of the arab economies has created considerable poverty
7887202 what triggers revolutions civil wars and other internal unrest is psychological factors particularly feelings of extreme despair
7887203 americas support for israel over the years has even been a critical element in winning and securing arab allies
7887204 absolutely no reason to believe that ending american support for israel would somehow eliminate

7887210 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7887211 even if you dont like politics gosh is the democrat convention ever exciting
7887212 it brings us together as a group kind of like therapy to see something growing and flourishing

7887214 usually i would pass even reading the music blogs that are all independent music but this one was actually good because it did not seem like you had to be a scenester knowing the secret handshake to be allowed to read it they have a good collection of artists from all over the map which is always what i like to see and they have this funny ad running on there site to bring 44 to singapore
7887215 small scale demonstration plants using shale oil from the stuart resource would still be allowed but only if companies got a licence and their technology passed strict environmental standards
7887216 signalled that other big developments will be canned if they threaten queenslands pristine environment
7887217 the government will devote the next two years to researching whether oil shale deposits can be used in an environmentally acceptable way
7887218 the breadth of our technology and our ability to help our customers with the challenges they have is really truly providing us with opportunities for significant wins
7887219 is the very strong volume growth in the context of a strong inflationary environment

7887228 the time was right to see if i could do something about it
7887229 in addition to showing warriors how they can exercise another means of gaining respect in tribes rather than violence were providing a biblical perspective for families and communities
7887230 their main form of violence is they steal each others cattle they do want peace and theyve been waiting for peace for a long time
7887231 how do you react when someone steals your cattle and kidnaps your daughter you think you have to retaliate
7887232 we got people from both tribes living together and reaping the benefits of living in a more fertile area of uganda
7887233 less civilized than the south and the people are very independent and generally govern themselves
7887234 we want to show the warriors how they can save face and cultivate respect without resorting to violence
7887235 this topping out ceremony is an important moment for the future of the university of kentucky
7887236 not only is it exciting to see this portion of construction completed i think the impressive size and scope of this new building will help people across our campus and throughout the state envision what uks academic medical campus of the future will look like i am looking forward to standing here in a couple of years alongside the college of pharmacys students faculty and staff to embark on a new era in scientific education and research in the commonwealth
7887237 the new uk college of pharmacy building wont just mean more space it will mean more opportunity for kentuckys best and brightest young men and women who want to pursue careers as valued patient care providers in communities in every county in the commonwealth
7887238 the new uk college of pharmacy building coupled with the new is setting the momentum for the university to offer unprecedented opportunities for the citizens of the commonwealth as we add state of the art research education and patient care space on our medical campus
7887239 eop architects along with ellenzweig and the entire design team are looking forward to the completion of this state of the art academic and research facility
7887240 we are confident that this building will do its part in helping make the uk college of pharmacy the number one pharmacy program in the nation

7887252 we find that the cost of capturing co2 with the complete system would fall between 80 and 250 t co2 and improvements are suggested which reduce the upper bound cost to 130 t co2 even at the high calculated cost air capture has implications for climate policy however dedicated engineering and technological innovation have potential to produce much lower cost systems
7887253 new technology that i do not understand will save us
7887254 as noted the models do not consider the possibility of an equilibration of the climate with a steady increase in aerosol as would actually occur thus the modeling is deficient in addressing this important reality
7887255 with interest i follow when capturing co2 from the air will be the lowest cost system
7887256 does this mean you support a carbon tax of up to 250 ton co2 to pay for it
7887257 there is no hard evidence that aerosol geoengineering would a result in dangerous reductions in stratospheric ozone or b lead to harmful acid precipitation
7887258 there is no linear predictability in terms of how ecosystems respond the phenomena of collapse is one that we have under appreciated partly because of the feed back mechanisms that we are still trying to understand
7887259 leemans and eickhout 2004 found that adaptive capacity decreases rapidly with an increasing rate of climate change their study finds that five percent of all ecosystems cannot adapt more quickly than 0 1 c per decade over time forests will be among the ecosystems to experience problems first because their ability to migrate to stay within the climate zone they are adapted to is limited if the rate is 0 3 c per decade 15 percent of ecosystems will not be able to adapt if the rate should exceed 0 4 c per decade all ecosystems will be quickly destroyed opportunistic species will dominate and the breakdown of biological material will lead to even greater emissions of co2 this will in turn increase the rate of warming
7887260 another reason for concern regional and global impacts on ecosystems for different levels of climate change
7887261 few seem to realise that the present ipcc models predict almost unanimously that by 2040 the average summer in europe will be as hot as the summer of 2003 when over 30 000 died from heat by then we may cool ourselves with air conditioning and learn to live in a climate no worse than that of baghdad now but without extensive irrigation the plants will die and both farming and natural ecosystems will be replaced by scrub and desert what will there be to eat the same dire changes will affect the rest of the world and i can envisage americans migrating into canada and the chinese into siberia but there may be little food for any of them
7887262 peak temperatures may rise twice as fast as average temperatures as climate change hots up
7887263 again i refer to the total abstention from other future possibilities although all the concerns deal with possible futures please see again goettmann fr d ric arne thomas and markus antonietti 2007 metal free activation of co2 by mesoporous graphitic carbon nitride angewandte chemie vol 46 no 15 pp 2717 2720 april 2 2007 if needed the future solution is e g this artificial photosynthesis besides nature and man gets the extra biomass urgently needed the main message is that human ingenuity will resolve this co2 problem if it exists at all
7887264 a much discussed idea to offset global warming by injecting sulfate particles into the stratosphere would have a drastic impact on earths protective ozone layer new research concludes the study led by simone tilmes of the national center for atmospheric research ncar in boulder colo warns that such an approach would delay the recovery of the antarctic ozone hole by decades and cause significant ozone loss over the arctic
7887265 the economics of geoengineering are there is no better word for it incredible according to teller et al 2003 5 engineered particles would be even cheaper mainly because of the reduced volume of material that would need to be put into the stratosphere they estimate that the sunlight scattering needed to offset the warming effect of rising greenhouse gas concentrations by the year 2100 would cost just 1 billion per year
7887266 the greens resistance to geo engineering sits very uncomfortably with its message that the planet is screwed and were all going to die it suggests that they dont actually believe their own press releases and that they know the situation is not as dire as they would like the rest of us to think it is it suggests that environmentalists regard science and engineering as the cause of problems and not the solution
7887267 i hope i never need a parachute but if my plane is going down in flames i sure hope i have a parachute handy
7887268 i hope well never need geoengineering schemes but if a climate catastrophe occurs i sure hope we will have thought through our options carefully
7887269 methadone is a pretty good metaphor kind of like saccharine sugarless sodas and decaf coffee not really facing the problem
7887270 we all know that we have to convert all coal fired power plants to nuclear worldwide by 2015 but it wont happen because the average american has an irrational fear of all things nuclear
7887271 measurements from space since the 1970s give a global annual earth albedo of 0 29 the average incident solar radiative flux is 341 w m 2 so that a change in albedo of 0 01 represents a global energy balance change of 3 4 w m 2 similar in magnitude to the impact of doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere global albedo can change with changes in earths cloud fractional coverage cloud thickness aerosol amount forest cover or snow and ice cover for example a 2 year change in albedo was caused by the large mount pinatubo volcanic eruption in june 1991 stratospheric aerosols from the eruption increased global albedo by up to 0 007 because of the reflection of an additional 2 5 w m 2 of solar radiation over the following 2 years
7887272 its not the whole biosphere at risk here except for very human centric definitions of biosphere its mostly the charismatic megafauna that are in trouble if you include people as charismatic debatable yes
7887273 all we have to do to destroy the planets climate and its biota and leave a ruined world to our children and grandchildren is to just keep on where were going today just keep releasing greenhouse gases at current rates just keep degrading and homogenizing and destroying our biological resources just continue releasing toxic chemicals at current rates and by the latter part of this century the world wont be fit to live in

7887281 basically i am wondering how energy intensive grinding up rock is it cant be too intensive for coal or else it wouldnt be useful as an energy source but im guessing coal is a bit softer than granite or basalt
7887282 take some old records off the shelf sit and listen to them by myself
7887283 we are excited to receive this major gift for a much needed project
7887284 when we recently created the commission for lenoir rhyne to study our future direction many people identified our status as a college of the evangelical lutheran church in america as a major strength that should be enhanced the construction of a chapel on campus will give a physical presence to that identity
7887285 theres no external memory everything code kernelm gfx music is in a single hex file flashed on the main chip and thats the goal only one thing to compile and flash since the kernel is arranged as a library its easy to just include it in the compilation along your game
7887286 one thing thats new as you go through the campaign you know normally in rts games how they start you off with a couple of units and then its like okay two missions later were going to give you tanks one of the things were looking at doing with starcraft iis campaign is putting the choice more in the players hands so maybe you like dealing more with infantry you can purchase those upgrades and make your marines and other infantry stronger or else youll save up the credits you get from the missions to get tanks sooner than you normally could

7887296 sepanjang pengalaman saya berdiskusi dengan kalangan militer kami tidak pernah membahas soal kondisi perpolitikan atau ekonomi negeri ini yang dalam situasi carut marut jadi saya tidak melihat mereka punya semacam contingency plan untuk itu
7887297 tentunya kondisi itu memang bisa menghambat pembangunan profesionalisme dan kemampuan operasional prajurit tni namun hal itu tidak akan serta merta berdampak mengancam proses reformasi militer atau malah demokratisasi kecuali para pemimpin militernya memang berniat memberontak

7887308 he has been preoccupied with escaping the shadow of his father and establishing his own image and identity in the eyes of others
7887309 he feels his experiences and performance as a pow have finally permitted this to happen
7887310 what is true is that a number of pows in those first few years after their release often acted erratically their lives pockmarked by drastic mood swings and uncharacteristic behavior before achieving a more mellow equilibrium
7887311 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

7887331 but john mccain seems to think that youre not rich until and unless you make 5 million yr
7887332 uh huh and thats why more minorities are democrats than republicans because the gop is so multicultural eh

7887334 these skills need to be developed at the k 12 level or students will lack the foundation to pursue math science and engineering degrees in college

7887337 the ice raid is in progress right now at howard industries in laurel mississippi
7887338 now we are all waiting to see what will happen to people being arrested at howard industries
7887339 we had been expecting the raids either on the coast or in hattiesburg we were getting information that ice was in hotels in the coast and other preparations were going on in hattiesburg
7887340 most of what we are getting today is that ice is focusing on jones county but havent had calls from all areas we have had calls from chicken plants in and around laurel we had expected the raids to occur at chicken plants it was a surprise its a different industry howard industries gets state and federal funding to operate
7887341 if i could only tell you how much i love you if i could only tell you all
7887342 in response to the filing by simcoe district co operative services there were limited options available

7887349 desafortunadamente estos llamados fueron ignorados tambi n por la otan y por la onu
7887350 estamos desconcertados por la extrema actividad de las fuerzas navales de la otan en el mar negro que contin a increment ndose
7887351 ayer dije que hab a nueve barcos de la otan y por la tarde otra fragata de guerra de estados unidos pas por el estrecho del b sforo
7887352 tambi n hemos podido saber que se espera la llegada de otros ocho buques de guerra de la otan

7887354 some girl go through a photography phase you know horses taking dumb pictures of your feet
7887355 the residents of oakland deserve better than to be victimized by acts of violence and robberies that tear at the very fabric of our community
7887356 given the recent series of armed robberies in oakland whole foods market has stepped up security in our oakland store so that whole foods market remains a safe and welcoming place to shop for members of the community
7887357 it will be the same people who in the 70s ridiculed california for talking about energy conservation
7887358 theyre so willing to embrace our concept ive never seen people who want to know the back story of a product more than san franciscans
7887359 they should all go on prozac the goal should be to eat right and raise your children well not buy heritage turkeys for 25 a pound
7887360 some really fancy dinners and some fancy wines but we also have pickles and potato chips
7887361 we need to go to the red states to people who celebrate traditional values
7887362 i think its important for a big event like this to be supported by city government which is the case here
7887363 maybe we will be dismissed by some people because its in san francisco but i think we can create a voice that connects all over the country who knows what we will stir up
7887364 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7887365 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7887368 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7887369 do you think they were really plotting to kill obama
7887370 i dont want to say yes i dont want to say no
7887371 of the intolerance shown by the chinese authorities toward tibetan culture and dissident voices
7887372 cold is good and when it comes to the ocean ecosystem the colder that upwelling gets the better it is for all the animals in the food chain
7887373 this year theres been a striking resurgence of krill in the waters off monterey bay particularly for one species that has really made a comeback from the past three years
7887374 sea surface temperatures that we monitor have been the coldest since the late 1980s and that translates all the way up the food chain
7887375 its bringing more and more food up into levels of the ocean where fish can feed better than they have in years
7887376 the numbers of brandts cormorants for example which should normally be chowing down on this years abundant anchovies havent recovered its really a mystery and we dont have an answer for it
7887377 they said if you dont voluntarily give up the dogs we will arrest you and put you in jail and charge a fine for each dog here
7887378 i equate this to living in one room of my house for all of my life and somebody just dropping groceries by once a week not a lot of stimulation
7887379 this is not what dogs were put on this planet for
7887380 how can you raise dogs without worming them and vaccinating them trimming their toenails and grooming them
7887381 we petted them and played with them and held them
7887382 they rode around on a golf cart with us they were very well socialized
7887383 some of them you put them on the ground and they dont know what it is because theyve lived their entire life on wire mesh
7887384 all the dogs had food and water in front of them at all times
7887385 you have to understand in an environment with four or five in a kennel theyre competing for food
7887386 you simply cant describe the overwhelming smell of the ammonia the feces
7887387 and these were kept decently clean but still the smell was just horrible
7887388 she was trying to care for the animals the best way she could but it was just impossible to care for that many dogs properly with the staff that the kennel had
7887389 these dogs have never been outside of that environment everything is new to them
7887390 they come to you with these bright eyes saying thank you
7887391 spiritual needs are so strong at the end of someones life thats when people question meaning and suffering and they deserve to have someone to minister to them and the garden is a place of peace it helps people replenish and be close to nature it is vitally important
7887392 ive been doing research at nursing homes for 30 years and ive never seen better care than what i saw at that hospice
7887393 if i were dying and could not be cared for at home i would want to be in that unit when we have something in the city that works so well it would be tragic if they did anything to reduce its effectiveness
7887394 they are right next to a garden but they dont get to be next to the quiet patients quasi comatose patients and they will have to share their garden we said you cant get everything you want but you will get some things

7887467 will pursue effective collaboration on pressing global issues among all the major powers including such newly emerging ones as china india russia brazil nigeria and south africa

7887469 we are committed to us engagement in asia this begins with maintaining strong relationships with allies like japan australia south korea thailand and the philippines and deepening our ties to vital democratic partners like india in order to create a stable and prosperous asia

7887509 there will be major and potentially dangerous consequences if services such as health and education are provided centrally as it will be difficult to protect the most vulnerable prisoners from those who might cause them harm
7887510 most of our boards favour smaller units and have negative experience of large establishments and clustering of prisons to achieve efficiency but at the cost of effective rehabilitation

7887516 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7887517 we already know that genetics and childhood infections play a vital role in the development of type 1 diabetes in children but the findings of this study indicate that the way a baby is delivered could affect how likely it is to develop this condition later in life
7887518 this study shows a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7887519 it is important to stress that the reason for this is still not understood although it is possible that the caesarean section itself is responsible perhaps because babies born via that method are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7887520 type 1 diabetes in childhood has become much more prevalent across europe recently and the rate of this increase suggests that environmental factors are the cause however despite much investigation these actual factors remain largely unknown

7887535 the clinton and obama camps agreed to limit wednesdays divisive nominating process for president allowing some states to cast votes for both obama and clinton before ending the roll call in an acclamation for the illinois senator
7887536 in one scenario clinton herself would cut off the voting and urge the unanimous nomination of obama according to democratic officials involved in the negotiations

7887540 bioglass is used to help mend broken bones recently researchers working at imperial college discovered a new kind of bioglass which seemed to work better but they could not work out all the details why
7887541 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7887542 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7887543 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
7887544 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
7887545 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7887546 landmark agreements have been concluded with every expectation that everyone will sign up
7887547 why would barack obama be friends with domestic terrorist bill ayers who bombed the capitol and is proud of it
7887548 we finally know what the big faults between wellington and blenheim are doing by combining the seafloor imagery with other data of the faulted sediments and rocks beneath the seabed we have been able to get a much more accurate idea of the location size and history of faults in the area
7887549 the general discontinuity of active faults across cook strait has important implications for how we interpret the size and location of future earthquakes in the region by determining the rate of activity on the faults over many thousands of years we can also estimate the interval of time between earthquakes on each fault this information has been added to the onshore active fault database at gns science to create a complete picture of the region which can be used to provide new estimates of the likelihood of earthquakes occurring
7887550 knowing that there is no connection between the north and south island major fault lines will have a critical impact on the accuracy of modeling to assess earthquake risk
7887551 accurate forecasting of potential earthquake hazard is essential to many agencies including emergency managers regional councils and insurers this collaborative work will greatly improve our ability to assess the reality of the earthquake risk and potential impact

7887556 secondly we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies
7887557 countermeasures in a situation where the united states violated the agreement
7887558 the united states is gravely mistaken if it thinks it can make a house search in the dprk as it pleases just as it did in iraq
7887559 the measure is regrettable as it came at a time when the six parties have to make concerted efforts to complete the second phase of the denuclearization process
7887560 as a year has passed since the north sealed the yongbyon reactor it would be difficult to restore the facilities and produce plutonium

7887566 investigations by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan found convincing evidence based on the testimony of eyewitnesses and others that some 90 civilians were killed including 60 children 15 women and 15 men
7887567 the authorities and responsibilities of the international forces in afghanistan must be regulated through a status of force agreement consistent with both international and afghan laws
7887568 the patience of the afghan people has ran out we no longer can afford to see the killing of our children
7887569 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 7 8 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others

7887597 this changes the strategic relationship between the us and poland there is a clear and explicit understanding that if there are negative consequences of stationing the missile shield the us will come to polands defense
7887598 in no way is the presidents plan for missile defense aimed at russia its to protect our european allies from any rogue threats
7887599 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow can launch following a first strike its a crucial element to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for ten interceptor missiles in poland but once established their number could be easily increased

7887607 the dark days of communist yore and captures the threat of what we and russias neighbors are up against
7887608 very dangerous game and perhaps one the russians want to reconsider
7887609 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
7887610 nato can act to stabiliz e this very dangerous situation
7887611 now is the time for action not just words russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met
7887612 making putin pay and turning russias georgian rout into a political defeat
7887613 to remove president saakasvili from the office to which he was elected in 2004 and to overthrow a democratic government
7887614 western authorities to explore the vulnerability of russian assets abroad or at least make life difficult for the holders of those assets
7887615 in the world of global commerce china calculated that staging an olympic extravaganza could enhance its ambivalent reputation by contrast the putin government seems to believe its power grows in sync with its reputation as an international pariah an outsider state
7887616 russia has damaged its credibility and its relations with the nations of the free world
7887617 russian tanks rolling through georgia with images of chechnya in 1994 and 99 vilnius 91 afghanistan 79 prague 68 hungary 56
7887618 the war in georgia marks an easy return to territorial expansion and attempted regional dominance
7887619 tried to give russians an alternative narrative he put forward democracy as a unifying and legitimizing idea for the new russian state
7887620 young democracies around russia back into moscows sphere of influence the worldview of a russian nationalist is hard for outsiders to comprehend
7887621 kremlin capitalism is a threat to the west by using its market strength in oil and gas resources to strong arm its neighbors and outmaneuver the us and eu
7887622 is to replace a pro western government with a new russian satellite reminiscent of the brezhnev doctrine its part of a broader campaign to annex new territory expand the russian empire conduct cyber attacks against the baltic states assassinate enemies and use economic intimidation through cutoffs of russian oil and gas shipments to ukraine and the czech republic it is important that moscow pays a concrete and tangible price for its latest aggression at least comparable to what it paid for the 1979 invasion of afghanistan
7887623 burned and houses broken unburied bodies lay rotting fresh graves were dug in gardens and basements most victims interviewed were ethnic georgians in central georgian villages some killings were carried out for revenge some involved theft and still others seemed to be that the power balance was shifting away from ethnic georgians to the ossetian separatists and their russian backers
7887624 georgians living in several of the villages said the russians occupying their land had treated them well done nothing to encourage them to leave and offered the only protection available from the south ossestian militias they feared most
7887625 us sees much to fear in a hostile russia by usher ing in a sustained period of renewed animosity with the west problems extend ing far beyond arms deals with syria and the mountains of georgia
7887626 the hegemon in that region and we are not and thats a fact
7887627 any kind of coercive actions like economic sanctions or anything else
7887628 abkhazia rallie d for independence and the abkhazian parliament has approved an official appeal to russia to recognize its independence
7887629 russia is always with you and will never leave you in the lurch
7887630 the kremlin is nearing formal recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia possibly as early as next week
7887631 support is likely and that after all the events that have occurred one should not expect otherwise
7887632 appealed to russia and to governments of other countries to recognize abkhazias independence
7887633 express such a will and if the russian president makes a relevant decision on this score
7887634 again said they will never agree to remain within georgia
7887635 in accordance with the international agreements to their previous places of deployment
7887636 envisaged in the international agreement poti is outside of the security zone
7887637 but that does not mean we will sit behind a fence watching them riding around in hummers
7887638 we have registered an increase in georgian reconnaissance activities and preparations for armed actions in the georgian south ossetian conflict zone
7887639 temporarily suspending military cooperation with nato until a political decision on relations
7887640 now we see russian forces which responded to attacks on russian peacekeepers in south ossetia legitimately
7887641 local s ossetian and abkhazian population said they fear georgia might repeat its regional aggression they also want russian troops to stay in the area to shield them from any possible attacks

7887661 the detrimental effect on the lives of other residents in the block has been unacceptable
7887662 despite police intervention at an early stage and repeated warnings to the tenant the situation has not been resolved and led us with no other option but to go for a closure order
7887663 this will ensure that other residents in the tenement can live in the peace and quiet that they deserve and to receive some respite for the next three months from the anti social behaviour that has upset their lives for a considerable amount of time

7887684 no police officers came to the hospital to tell me what happened
7887685 it made me feel almost not worthy like i wasnt sure if they were really looking into my fathers case or what was going on
7887686 it seems as though once a crime happens its always the criminal that gets all the attention and the victims are left to wonder whats going on
7887687 im in a variety of different communities on a daily basis that have been personally visited and heard by our current police chief chief mccaskill has given me a voice
7887688 for me to stand before you praising mccaskill with accolades is his biggest accomplishment to date and i dont feel its fair that mccaskill is being targeted by media and others for issues that werent part of his watch
7887689 im feeling awkward and cant think of anything to say because ive never met a black person since there are only about 10 of you living in ireland

7887694 while job outsourcing corporate bankruptcies layoffs and unfair negotiations are rampant this years labor day list employers and their employees unions tell another story they are proving that tumultuous labor relations are a thing of the past not the future
7887695 these companies buck the trend and showcase the strength that comes when workers and management create long lasting productive partnerships economic success does not have to come at the expense of workers rights
7887696 hey benny be honest with me do you think i can really sing

7887702 also the soffits are open on the addition leo meant to ask you about that when he spoke to you today but he forgot as i heard the siding people were supposed to cover those was that incorrect if the job is incomplete we shouldnt pay them
7887703 per contract they were not supposed to touch the soffits if there is entry there ill check it out and get something done with it
7887704 what its open space on the end of our addition contractor i mean ok fine if the siding guys werent supposed to take care of that even though that was the understanding leo had after a conversation he had with you last week but there is definitely entry there i wish i had a picture i could send you so you can see what im talking about are you planning on being there tomorrow or should i take pictures and send them to you
7887705 youre the one suffering you have a choice and youre choosing your destiny
7887706 whats going on is there are many many many ways to not make ayp and if you fail in any one of them you fail to make ayp
7887707 but theyre all at different stages of their development and to say theyre all going to meet their targets at the same time is highly improbable
7887708 the bar will be raised again in two years so schools must continue to improve and find ways to reach all kids and make sure they get the quality education they deserve
7887709 we cant afford to rest we must keep our foot on the gas pedal and not let up
7887710 the reason seaholm and groves high schools did not make ayp is because the subgroup of special education students didnt make the percent proficient the state requires
7887711 at groves for example 23 percent of the 30 students were rated as proficient
7887712 but special education students arent supposed to be proficient because in order to even be in special education you have to not be able to achieve like the other students thats the dilemma
7887713 to be competitive michigan needs the best educated work force in the nation and the fact that one in every four high school students is failing to graduate on time is totally unacceptable
7887714 these new completion rates are going to give the impression that our graduation rate has dropped when it hasnt at all
7887715 the good news is that the students are coming back to school
7887716 students drop out sometimes more than once for economic or other reasons and then come back but thats not reflected in the graduation rate the statistics only give part of the story
7887717 i think the new method is much more accurate because were getting a student by student measure and this will make sure no child is left behind
7887718 but the way the state is measuring a district when you have a significant number of alternative education students that does not fairly represent the district
7887719 id like to see 95 percent but how are we going to get there
7887720 must develop more resources to help address the broad scope of issues involved in students leaving school early
7887721 but its up to local communities to work together with public schools and use those tools to develop solutions that work for students
7887722 it is an honor to be recognized and a true validation of our long term business strategy which is to be the best private bank in the west
7887723 our success in achieving exceptional client satisfaction is the direct result of the passion creativity and hard work of each first western team member

7887740 nosotros coincidimos que hay que buscar un equilibrio la movilidad debe generar una recomposici n del haber previsional y que a la vez sea sostenible en el tiempo porque no sea cosa que en un par de a os se sufra una nueva frustraci n porque el estado no puede afrontar las erogaciones
7887741 en general va a haber consenso aunque no sea en todos los puntos
7887742 el sentido com n indica que nadie se puede oponer a una ley de movilidad jubilatoria en la argentina
7887743 queda un debate abierto para el resto de las cuestiones que hacen a la seguridad social
7887744 desde la concertaci n vamos a proponer que se genere un debate profundo sobre la ley de solidaridad previsional que en realidad es de insolidaridad y con la ley 24 241 que fue creada para disolver el sistema de reparto

7887748 este risco est diretamente associado fraqueza das oposi es e ao d ficit de capacidade t cnica e experi ncia governativa para assegurar uma gest o eficiente e racional
7887749 a crescente interven o governamental em dom nios econ micos que pertencem ao setor privado pode conduzir a um desincentivo da iniciativa privada mesmo em um contexto em que as oportunidades de neg cio s o in meras e diversificadas
7887750 em situa es de menor capacidade de organiza o e controle do crescimento econ mico os oportunistas multiplicam se os ganhos f ceis abundam e a corrup o torna se um meio de vida

7887758 they said if you dont voluntarily give up the dogs we will arrest you and put you in jail and charge a fine for each dog here
7887759 i equate this to living in one room of my house for all of my life and somebody just dropping groceries by once a week not a lot of stimulation
7887760 this is not what dogs were put on this planet for
7887761 how can you raise dogs without worming them and vaccinating them trimming their toenails and grooming them
7887762 we petted them and played with them and held them
7887763 they rode around on a golf cart with us they were very well socialized
7887764 some of them you put them on the ground and they dont know what it is because theyve lived their entire life on wire mesh
7887765 all the dogs had food and water in front of them at all times
7887766 you have to understand in an environment with four or five in a kennel theyre competing for food
7887767 you simply cant describe the overwhelming smell of the ammonia the feces
7887768 and these were kept decently clean but still the smell was just horrible
7887769 she was trying to care for the animals the best way she could but it was just impossible to care for that many dogs properly with the staff that the kennel had
7887770 these dogs have never been outside of that environment everything is new to them
7887771 they come to you with these bright eyes saying thank you

7887826 it may also indicate that doctors are biased by their inevitable involvement in complex cases or labours where things have gone wrong

7887925 in the end it was very straightforward to get the proposals through planning permission there was a clear majority vote for it but there was always the potential for concern because this is a very contemporary building in a very historic city
7887926 i think all credit to the architect keith williams who also designed the unicorn theatre in london who has done a very contemporary design which has reflected the pattern and the colour of the streets around the venue although it is very contemporary its very sympathetic
7887927 the intention is that there will still be shows in a range of venues around the city
7887928 well work in partnership with other theatres there will be concerts at the cathedral and well also do quite a lot of work which will focus on the kind of work we want to produce in the second space at the new theatre which will be new to us this will be producing our own shows as well as community and education work well also be building on our outside performance programme and it is our intention to still have the pantomime seasons running hopefully in a big top style theatre

7887931 laboratory testing has shown that the 34 horses at the clinic are healthy
7887932 after stringent testing and retesting by the australian animal health laboratory we are now confident the other horses at the clinic have been spared from the virus and pose no threat to the community
7887933 after extensive testing the 34 horses have shown to be free of the virus so it is appropriate to lift the quarantine status
7887934 the animals are now able to be safely returned to their owners which is very good news
7887935 we agreed to the owners request to run further tests and will be speaking with them about the future of the horse
7887936 unfortunately the scientific evidence tells us there is a possibility of a horse suffering a relapse of the disease and posing a serious risk to other horses or humans

7887983 using a memorandum of understanding could present hurdles illustrated by the fate of an obscure agricultural agreement signed by the united states and iraq three years ago the 2005 memorandum promoting agricultural reform and cooperation was not introduced to the iraqi parliament until january and has not been ratified although bush administration officials contend that a security deal with iraq would have legal force the state departments bureau of near eastern affairs acknowledged in an e mail that the agricultural memorandum is a political understanding and an expression of cooperation and good will that does not obligate resources shown the response two legal scholars from yale bruce ackerman and oona hathaway said the state department has accepted our position that memorandums of understanding with iraq do not have legal force especially when they have not been ratified by the iraqi parliament that means that trading the u n mandate for an mou with iraq is not only unconstitutional but there is also a serious risk that it will leave u s troops unprotected and exposed
7887984 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
7887985 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
7887986 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
7887987 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago

7888035 before sat could prove if it would leave a perma nent imprint on the building of sustainable capacity its life was cut short as the canadian government took the decision to replace the dnd sat with a civilian crew

7888049 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

7888056 it seems we might pull things together for maximum devotion this time as all current and previous distractions are now gone the summer festivals are over and the level of live gigs for the next months are put to a minimum and
7888057 so what about the music bits and pieces have been collected ever since

7888061 the crowds themselves were phenomenal and if i do say so myself we absolutely killed it on this tour
7888062 immediately before this run we did a show in moscow the with full force festival and wacken seaside moscow was fucking incredible what a great experience it was actually quite the thriving city i was thinking it would be all breadlines and cardboard boxes but much to my surprise we saw prada stores and bling everyone spoke english pretty well and the show was sincerely amazing those people are soooooo into music its in their soul as dave mcclain drums mentioned in the mayhem video diary when we played descend the entire crowd sat down on the floor and then shot up and sang it was so friggin rad after that was the with full force festival which we headlined again always a huge honor for us im not gonna say it was our most flawless performance cough both phil demmel guitar and i were pretty hammered when we played but man there was something magical about this show we were so on fire as a band it wasnt even funny we had fuckin telepathy going and the four of us just locked in so friggin hard it was an unbelievable feeling it was a sloppy sort of perfection drunk and sweaty spontaneous and reckless beautiful and dangerous just when it felt like it might fall apart we pulled it back together and killed it all over again for me it was one of the greatest shows this band has ever played and as i watched it back on the dvd they gave us i gotta say it was everything ive ever wanted in a metal show we owned heres some pics from the moscow wff and mayhem insanity

7888067 as a catholic thats a decision that biden and god are going to have to work out at the pearly gates

7888079 we all read the polls and the polls are pretty discouraging
7888080 but having been discouraged by the polls weve then got to ask ourselves the question what is the alternative is there anyone who we are confident would do better

7888102 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
7888103 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society

7888109 a two party system that allows imperialism and racism to continue unrestrained
7888110 they couldnt scare us with all their weaponry and their over blowing the situation
7888111 the content of the sunday march was very strong very militant and thats why we framed the anti imperialist message the way we did
7888112 that was created by the city to make us appear as if were a fringe element and that were disgusting people hales said
7888113 if you look at the 1968 convention the violence came from the police
7888114 what recreate 68 is about is trying to fight for policies that bring justice and not war starvation and death were having an economic crisis in this country and its just going to get worse spending billions on the war were saying that there is a war at home and a war abroad
7888115 the thinking is that he does not get games here and this way he gets top level games somewhere we have kolo gallas djourou song and now silvestre we have congestion in there and we want him to play without losing him

7888122 he came to us after deciding that he couldnt go on any more
7888123 this was an exceptional case his long term memory was fine but he could not remember day to day things the time the day what was in his supermarket trolley
7888124 more worryingly he did not seem aware himself that he had these memory problems
7888125 this is obviously an extreme case so we should not blow any observations out of proportion
7888126 but if this is what is happening to very heavy users it might be an indication that daily use of ecstasy over a long period of time can lead to irreversible memory problems and other cognitive deficits
7888127 unfortunately he discharged himself before we were able to complete the assessment
7888128 we continued to support him but he started to use cannabis again and he dropped out we tried to re engage him but we lost him about a year ago

7888135 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job hiding it tonight i promise you that
7888136 i know sen mccain has a lifetime of experience that he will bring to the white house and sen obama has a speech he gave in 2002
7888137 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7888138 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7888139 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7888140 to discuss ways in which his foundation is addressing some of the worlds most pressing problems
7888141 president clinton understands this is sen obamas convention and he is here to do all he can to make sen obama our next president

7888146 article highlights a nasa study on the survivability of hydrazine fuel tank used an oversimplified model leading to an overly optimistic assessment of the tanks survival but even this study showed how the tank would have burned up when reentering the atmosphere therefore washingtons contention that the tank would have hit the ground intact posing a health hazard seems questionable

7888148 outlaw us insurance multinational driving u k government welfare policy
7888149 on tuesday 6th november the bbc ten oclock news broadcast a report about the massive us multinational unumprovident and how it is driving uk welfare reform policy fronted by the secret policeman investigative journalist mark daly the report uncovered documents from unum in the uk boasting that they were and are influencing government policy policies influenced included the assessment of ability to work the ending of g ps sicknotes and the welfare reform act the insurance giant has been described in the us as a an outlaw company that for years has operated in an illegal fashion
7888150 what is wanted is not the will to believe but the will to find out which is the exact opposite
7888151 many critics of the govt have noted that in many ways the results of their welfare policies is that we seem to be going back in time back to the 1930s or even to the 19th c poor law in an excellent and detailed article the herald reports that in scotland because of what is claimed are major failings by the dwp to deliver stirling citizens advice bureau cab are to launch a food voucher scheme because of the numbers of people they are seeing who are left penniless due to catastrophic failures and hold ups in the benefits system the scheme is to be launched by alex mcleish coach of scotlands national football side
7888152 as a sidenote the cab in scotland would certainly appear to be more progressive than here in england where the national cab is to collude with the govt in sharing information on claimants and only weakly criticising the welfare reforms
7888153 what is wanted is not the will to believe but the will to find out which is the exact opposite

7888166 japan has taken every conceivable measure to fight against racial discrimination
7888167 people dont use bicycles as a commute option because they dont feel safe on our roads
7888168 so the first of these three elements segregating the bike lane from the rest of traffic along key corridors in downtown is critical
7888169 if were really going to move the needle to encourage people to change their commuting habits it seems to me its less about building trails and lanes to far flung places in the county as much as it advertisement click here is focusing on those locations that we know are key destinations for people
7888170 all those things they want to implement that would make it so much nicer
7888171 the way things are going with cars and gasoline prices human power is going to be a lot more prominent its part of the solution right
7888172 every year were seeing more people get on their bikes
7888173 whats happening is that the transit facilities were built to handle a certain number of riders the demand is surpassing that
7888174 the cost will depend on how many corridors we identify and for how many miles
7888175 this is a real opportunity to encourage people to change their commuting habits

7888182 these short term incentives are intended to ultimately spark our students long term interest in their own education
7888183 i understand their reasoning for offering financial incentives and i understand the chancellors point that a lot of families do offer their own incentives and this is to even the playing field but i dont think its the schools decision to offer that
7888184 i would really try hard not to motivate kids by bribing them you always want the intrinsic motivation you always want kids to be motivated by themselves but that takes parents
7888185 military operations lasted several hours during which air strikes were called in
7888186 the destruction from aerial bombardment was clearly evident with some 78 houses having been totally destroyed and serious damage to many others
7888187 the impact of such operations undermines the trust and confidence of the afghan people in efforts to build a just peaceful and law abiding state
7888188 airstrikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7888189 if aung san suu kyi continues to refuse food from her comrades her health will be of serious concern
7888190 two people living with her are also refusing food the international communitys immediate action is necessary
7888191 there have been rumours like this before which have turned out not to be true but given the way gambari seems to favour the regime one could imagine that she is feeling very frustrated
7888192 gambari does not have the respect of the military regime and is seen as biased by the democracy movement it is hard to see how he can carry on as un envoy
7888193 if you could have any boat here which would you have and what would you call it
7888194 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as i am concerned thats the end of the matter
7888195 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7888196 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7888197 allegations of this nature are of course highly defamatory and they were particularly offensive to the claimant because they are simply not true
7888198 in fact as a number of his protection officers volunteered to testify in the event that this matter came to trial sir salman conducted himself with dignity and courtesy throughout a time of great personal danger and concern
7888199 they are also here to apologise unequivocally to sir salman rushdie as well as ms west for the hurt and damage which they have suffered as a result of the publication of these allegations
7888200 in view of sir salman rushdies belief in free expression he has uniquely in a british libel action not sought damages nor has sir salman asked for any opinions in the book to be altered only that the false and defamatory content be taken out
7888201 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers to an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
7888202 i am very gratified by the outcome it seems to me to have been an avoidable business the facts were not checked before publishing these allegations
7888203 my interest was solely to establish the truth over the number of serious allegations about myself elizabeth west and indeed about the behaviour of the police force
7888204 stand up in the high court and own up to being a liar
7888205 i hope it will be an original and new method by which to establish facts rather than going for enormous financial damages

7888218 our fans should be calm as always in the return of sheva we never talked about kaka with chelsea
7888219 it broke my heart last year to do some of the things i was doing
7888220 it really went against the grain what we had to do in europe because of the perilous position we were in the premiership so we were changing it
7888221 we werent trying to get ourselves knocked out of the fa cup or carling cup or uefa cup but we couldve picked stronger teams
7888222 were going to give it everything weve possibly got to win the competitions that were entering
7888223 last year we had issues because of our league position so that had to be where we prioritised

7888342 de lucht die we uitademen bevat 15 procent co2 iedereen kent wel het effect van een klaslokaal waar je een repetitie hebt gemaakt we komen er met hoofdpijn uit omdat we met zijn allen in zon kleine ruimte te veel co2 hebben geproduceerd
7888343 als de concentraties co2 lokaal te hoog worden treedt een verdringing van zuurstof op je ademhalingssysteem raakt verstoord en je bent niet meer in staat om voldoende zuurstof uit de lucht op te nemen een vervelende eigenschap van co2 is dat het zich dan als een zwaar gas gedraagt dat niet direct optrekt het verspreidt zich in de lucht en kan als een soort deken blijven hangen

7888368 jeder anerkennungsfall ist von seiner natur her ein sonderfall wie im kosovo hat die lage in s dossetien und abchasien ihre besonderheiten
7888369 si uno entra en ese tipo de lenguaje en ese tipo de descalificaciones o en ese tipo de humor incomprensible puede generar una escalada

7888373 wir haben keine bilateralen energieprobleme es besteht jedoch die politische notwendigkeit dem land das wir f r einen strategischen partner der europ ischen union halten zur kenntnis zu bringen dass wir seine entscheidung die unabh ngigkeit von abchasien und s dossetien anzuerkennen mit betr bnis aufnehmen

7888375 ich trete f r die territoriale integrit t georgiens auf aber ausschlie lich in dessen nat rlichen historischen und kulturellen grenzen folglich f r die unabh ngigkeit s dossetiens und abchasiens oder zumindest f r die anerkennung ihres selbstbestimmungsrechtes
7888376 europ ischer l nder die gegen die unabh ngigkeit und selbstbestimmung von s dossetien und abchasien auftreten nachdem sie mit kriegsmitteln das kosovo ergriffen und es als unabh ngigen staat anerkannt haben und diese unabh ngigkeit durch milit rische besatzung erhalten
7888377 es f llt mir schwer zu begreifen wieso die nato und die eu das kosovo als einen unabh ngigen und souver nen staat auf grund der nationalen kulturellen und ethnischen einheit anerkannt haben w hrend es immer ein bestandteil des alten serbischen k nigreiches gewesen ist

7888398 het zal een grote bureaucratische chaos opleveren en het zal een ongewenst verschijnsel in nederland de leegstand weer vergroten
7888399 wat beoog je met die wet gaat het alleen maar om een handjevol krakers de gevangenis in te krijgen om de leegstand in de nederland weer hand over hand te laten toenemen want dat is wat er gaat gebeuren
7888400 na zes maanden moet je het melden dat het leeg staat en dan kan een gemeente in overleg andere bewoners voorstellen bijvoorbeeld studenten daar ben ik voorstander van maar geef ons dan ook echt de mogelijkheid om dat te gaan doen met ook sancties voor de eigenaren want alleen maar een boete van 7500 euro ten opzichte van krakers die met jarenlange gevangenisstraffen worden bedreigd ik denk dat niet in verhouding is

7888491 nee we zijn nooit jaloers we weten wat we aan elkaar hebben waarom zou ik jaloers zijn ze is van mij ligt elke avond naast mij in bed en ik ga ook met haar trouwen
7888492 als artiest hoor je natuurlijk heel vaak hoe fantastisch je bent wat ook ontzettend leuk is maar op het moment dat iemand die z veel van je houdt en van wie jij houdt in je gezicht zegt wat ben je eigenlijk mooi dan doet dat me h l veel ze prijst me ook vaak om dingen die ik doe en geeft me kleine cadeautjes
7888493 het nummer hemel is hier bijvoorbeeld kwam tot stand toen yolanthe en ik met vakantie waren op de malediven we hadden het erover dat mensen vaak klagen en de mooie dingen in hun leven niet zien terwijl je van de ene op de andere dag hartstikke dood kunt zijn dan is er denk ik niets meer de boodschap van dat lied is geniet van het n
7888494 dat gaat over het overlijden van yolanthes vader xavier cabau stierf vorig jaar op 53 jarige leeftijd red daar heeft ze h l veel verdriet van gehad en nog steeds ik heb geprobeerd alles wat ze tegen me vertelde en hoe ze zich voelde in dat nummer te verwerken ik zing het op een heel zachte manier met een kopstem die had ik v r mijn operatie niet mijn stem is beter dan ooit
7888495 dat was echt drama we zijn daardoor in korte tijd erg naar elkaar toegegroeid

7888498 ik zou zelf ook nooit een single kopen van een jochie van 11 dat net iets te dik is en zingt over zijn oma dus ik begrijp dat wel
7888499 soms wel veertien per week voor de operatie ging ik daar geregeld met angst naar toe dan voelde ik s ochtends al het wordt niks met mijn stem terwijl ik dan nog twee keer moest die dag en de volgende dag weer
7888500 allemaal dingen die voorheen nooit konden want ik moest altijd werken
7888501 dankzij yolanthe als artiest draait in negen van de tien gevallen alles om jou zo ben ik opgevoed het is altijd hoe is het jan hoe gaat het met je cd en dan het standaardpraatje goed hij komt bijna uit of we staan op nummer n
7888502 met yolanthe kreeg ik er een hele familie bij die haar eigen lief en leed heeft waar ik een tijd niks vanaf wist tot zij me vroeg wat doet mijn zus voor werk dat wist ik niet en mijn andere zus dat wist ik ook niet nou wordt het dan niet tijd dat je eens gaat vragen hoe het met h n gaat ze heeft me als mens verbeterd

7888556 to do the kind of attack that this bruce jacobs did on the widow of a murdered officer that gave his life for this community less than year ago is reprehensible
7888557 bruce jacobs you cold heartedly attacked a heros wife and family and attempted to disgrace his memory
7888558 i was asked to speak on the human costs of illegal immigration and i think im qualified to speak on that
7888559 for him to go on the attack like that without knowing why i went to d c or knowing what i was saying was pretty reprehensible

7888561 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself

7888564 wholly unacceptable for broadcast on a free to air channel
7888565 the unencrypted broadcast of content showing presenters engaging in explicit sexual activity without strong and sufficient editorial justification for the inclusion of such images is totally unacceptable it has the potential to cause offence to viewers and harm to minors
7888566 in short it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now the purpose of cutting taxes now is not to incur a budget deficit but to achieve the more prosperous expanding economy which can bring a budget surplus

7888573 russia is trying to legalize the results of an ethnic cleansing it has conducted to oppose it to the west
7888574 but it will result in russias isolation from the world
7888575 nothing to improve the prospects of peace in the caucasus
7888576 i think the surest sign that there is intelligent life out there in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us

7888586 we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs

7888594 la virgen inmaculada asunta en cuerpo y alma a la gloria celestial fue ensalzada por el se or como reina universal con el fin de que se asemejase de forma m s plena a su hijo se or de se ores y vencedor del pecado y de la muerte
7888595 a partir del siglo v casi en el mismo per odo en que el concilio de efeso proclama a la virgen madre de dios se comienza a atribuir a mar a el t tulo de reina el pueblo cristiano con este ulterior reconocimiento de su dignidad excelsa quiere situarla por encima de todas las criaturas exaltando su papel y su importancia en la vida de cada persona y del mundo entero
7888596 el t tulo de reina no sustituye al de madre su realeza sigue siendo un corolario de su peculiar misi n materna y expresa simplemente el poder que le ha sido conferido para llevar a cabo esta misi n los cristianos miran con confianza a mar a reina y esto aumenta su abandono filial en aquella que es madre en el orden de la gracia
7888597 i cant imagine the people around mccain are this dumb but they might be a bunch of yes men

7888615 this unprecedented study aims to arm marketers with data and insights to help them more effectively target this growing audience
7888616 said jeff meier senior director of sales and marketing for four seasons residence club vail
7888617 vail real estate buyers see the pace at which inventory is diminishing and are responding more quickly we

7888630 as good as these kids have been as a team
7888631 my job is to get a quality building open for the kids and the citizens of this district wednesday
7888632 will it be 100 percent complete no it will be the same as any other construction project the light switch that doesnt work the floor tile that is discolored or the door that bangs somewhere
7888633 i am here to find out why we missed some of those deadlines and more importantly why didnt osfc know about it
7888634 new construction is much easier you can go into a vacant field and start from the ground up you know what youve got to work with in a renovation youre never sure what you are going to run into
7888635 this is not just the typical punch list thats left to be done there are some very significant issues that have to be addressed i think the root of much of it is that promises were made early on about time frames that were probably not realistic its very unfortunate that the building will not be 100 percent ready for the first day because that first impression for students and the community is very important when the community sees the investments made in this type of project they want to see positive results and ultimately that will be the result here of that im confident
7888636 and make the next one better im not doing my job

7888641 the survey clearly shows that town halls hugely resent having to pass the electoral roll to direct marketing companies most people hate junk mail and cold calling and councils do not want to be a part of the process that generates money for junk mail companies in this way
7888642 selling the electoral roll undermines democracy dissuades people from voting and gives people the impression that the council is profiting from selling their personal information ministers must change the law to ban junk mail firms from getting their information through the electoral roll
7888643 fiddly costly and frankly a pain in the backside for councils

7888729 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7888730 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7888731 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7888732 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
7888733 integrate more completely and harmonize the standards that apply to the f b i s activities
7888734 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
7888735 this document clarifies the rules by which the f b i conducts its intelligence mission
7888736 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
7888737 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
7888738 while there is no national turnaround in residential real estate prices it is possible that we are seeing some regions struggling to come back which has resulted in some moderation in price declines at the national level

7888748 it was not at all my intention to put nuns on the catwalk
7888749 it was interpreted as more of a physical thing now no one is saying that nuns cant be beautiful but i was thinking about something more complete
7888750 we have to draw more attention to the world of nuns who are often not sufficiently appreciated by society
7888751 many monasteries in italy are dying because of a lack of religious vocations
7888752 the computer was removed from our secure storage facility in essex and sold on ebay
7888753 we know which employee took the server and sold it but we believe it was an honest mistake and it was not intentional to sell it without the server being cleared
7888754 this is a very unfortunate incident and we are taking measures to ensure it will never happen again
7888755 graphic data has confirmed to us that one of their machines appears to have been inappropriately sold on via a third party
7888756 we take this issue extremely seriously and are working to resolve this regrettable loss with graphic data as a matter of urgency
7888757 4 6 size seems a bit odd to me can it really fit kids between all three of those ages but the finished chest size is 28 so thats got to be big enough right well i guess well see

7888759 sometimes things dont go your way or you have a bad game but i think we really do have the ability to put some high scoring games on the table like the chivas game i think we have the ability to do some amazing things

7888765 it is not just the downpour in the rivers catchment area upstream that is responsible for the sudden rise in the gomti water level here
7888766 the rise is also due to gomtis backflow on account of the rising level of the ganga river
7888767 we deployed boats to evacuate people from certain marooned villages on the citys outskirts while a large number of pumps have been pressed into service to drain excess water from low lying urban and semi urban localities
7888768 of these 93 were washed away in floods while the rest had met their end in house collapses largely in the rural areas
7888769 we clearly wanted to learn from the new york situation and we wanted to have an improved processing plan
7888770 these are human beings its our duty to protect the care for them
7888771 i think one of the things that was brought out in these papers is that maybe these warnings arent enough
7888772 maybe the warnings need to be complemented with other things like guidelines
7888773 the rates that those drugs looked like they were increasing was a little bit blunted
7888774 the warnings didnt have i would think the effect that people might have wanted to have seen on the way the drugs are being prescribed
7888775 how much money would you be willing to pay today to have never had acne your whole life erase all the acne youve ever had and never have it again

7888791 consumer confidence readings suggest that the economy remains stuck in neutral but may be showing signs of improvement by early next year

7888794 one thing you can always count on with highland is that they will be tough
7888795 they were ready to play and it is tough to play at highland so im pleased with this win
7888796 we saw a lot of positive strong points but we still havent come on as a team together
7888797 we have girls who do great things we will be at our strongest when everyone plays well at the same time
7888798 some girls were afraid to make mistakes then they made them there were a lot of scoring runs throughout the game fortunately we came out on top
7888799 we need to work on our passes but we still saw some good things we are a really strong team it is disheartening to start the season with two losses but it is really good experience to progress the rest of the season
7888800 the rule of thumb says this is probably one third higher because people stop looking for jobs
7888801 this is the highest its been in ohio in 15 years
7888802 quotes entire chapters taken from angelas writings in his exhortations to his novices
7888803 the theme of self knowledge as a foundation stone for the spiritual life was quite widespread in the middle ages the basic source for it was the widely read and copied confessions of st augustine
7888804 because i had understood the power of god and perceived now his deep humility my soul was filled with wonder and esteemed itself to be nothing at all indeed saw in itself nothing except pride
7888805 complete knowledge of itself and complete knowledge of the goodness of god
7888806 the soul is first of all so filled with knowledge of itself that it does not seem to it that it could be filled more fully nor can it be aware of anything else or remember anything else and at that moment it suddenly comes to the awareness of the goodness of god it sees both together in a totally undescribable way
7888807 the purpose of prayer is nothing other than to manifest god and self and this manifestation of god and self leads to a state of perfect and true humility for this humility is attained when the soul sees god and self it is in this profound state of humility and from it that divine grace deepens and grows in the soul i cannot conceive anything greater than the manifestation of god and self but this discovery that is this manifestation of god and self is the lot only of those legitimate sons of god who have devoted themselves to true prayer
7888808 we shall never learn to know ourselves except by endeavouring to know god
7888809 enter the castle first by the room where humility is practised
7888810 enter first into the room where self knowledge is dealt with rather than fly off to the other rooms
7888811 it is encouraging to see that trials which seemed to us impossible to submit to are possible to others and that they bear them sweetly their flight makes us try to soar like nestlings taught by the elder birds who though they cannot fly far at first little by little imitate their parents i know the great benefit of this
7888812 the object of our life must be to do what he requires of us let us not ask that our will may be done but his if we have not yet attained to this let us be humble as i said above humility is the ointment for our wounds if we have it although perhaps he may defer his coming for a time god who is our physician will come and heal us
7888813 let us now return to our little dove and see what graces god gives it in this state this implies that the soul endeavours to advance in the service of our lord and in self knowledge
7888814 the first of these is a perception of the greatness of god which becomes clearer to us as we witness more of it secondly we gain self knowledge and humility from seeing how creatures so base as ourselves in comparison with the creator of such wonders have dared to offend him in the past or venture to gaze on him now the third grace is a contempt for all earthly things unless they are consecrated to the service of so great a god
7888815 i do not believe god will ever bestow these gifts on such a person as before doing so he always gives thorough self knowledge how can that soul while filled with such lofty aspirations realize the truth that he has shown it great mercy in not casting it into hell
7888816 once while i was wondering why our lord so dearly loves the virtue of humility the thought suddenly struck me without previous reflection that it is because god is the supreme truth and humility is the truth for it is most true that we have nothing good of ourselves but only misery and nothingness whoever ignores this lives a life of falsehood they that realize this fact most deeply are the most pleasing to god the supreme truth for they walk in the truth god grant sisters that we may have the grace never to lose this self knowledge amen

7888824 it is so bad that its very hard for us to determine accurate exit polls due to the large number of people filling the polling centres and the long jams outside

7888862 a quick politico survey of stylists and hair transplant surgeons some of whom have followed bidens career path for years while others didnt know about him until yesterday found that there was little mystery
7888863 joe biden does bring one big constituency with him the hair club for men this man is a role model to millions of american men he beat a disease male pattern baldness
7888864 i like joe biden despite snide asides that hes been preparing a 500 000 word acceptance speech since iowa and the hair plug jokes
7888865 also america is no longer a place where citizens care about plagiarism or hair plugs
7888866 sam donaldson and his hair walk by presumably to interview joe biden and his hair
7888867 with tragedy sprinkled throughout his life hes earned every white hair fill in your own hair plug joke
7888868 in fact everything about biden from his hair plugs and capped teeth to his working class irish catholic upbringing to his extremely long tenure in the nations most exclusive club screams vain old white guy
7888869 biden has taken ribbing over the years for his changing hairline theres been talk about hair plugs since his first run for president in 1987
7888870 p lus the widespread rumor that his hair is not his own
7888871 its going to be wall to wall hair plugs today a continuous stream of joe biden
7888872 joe biden senator barack obamas vice presidential running mate is a career politician who has taken big contributions from lobbyists been mocked for his hair transplants and admitted plagiarising speeches and exaggerating his academic record
7888873 but the juxtaposition between rich romney and biden who bears a common touch from his hair plugs to his loafers probably wouldnt help mccain much
7888874 hes tan rested and thanks to exquisite teeth and some excellent hair plugs camera ready
7888875 and that leads to the easy warning that ive been telling friends for years never trust a man who gets hairplugs
7888876 bidens hair look it doesnt really matter okay but it was distracting joe needs to tell his barber to take a little more off the back and sides
7888877 i have to say his inability to shut up drives me up the wall but theres also an appealing lack of guile to the man he wears his flaws like his hair plugs out and proud
7888878 and the dubious distinction of becoming the first national party nominee with known hair plugs
7888879 the problem is that whereas obama is a young lightweight biden is an old lightweight obama with a hair transplant
7888880 there is no doubt he had hair transplants the guy is wearing barbies hair
7888881 i s there anyone that thinks that biden brings much of anything to this ticket aside from hair plugs and an over inflated sense of self worth that is
7888882 the selection of joe biden the oldest functioning white liberal senator with a foreign policy background who is catholic with hair plugs in the democratic party
7888883 joe biden now has an unfair advantage in the game of politics with hair that is not where god intended it to be its just so unfair to dick cheney
7888884 a quick politico survey of stylists and hair transplant surgeons some of whom have followed bidens career path for years while others didnt know about him until yesterday found that there was little mystery
7888885 joe biden does bring one big constituency with him the hair club for men this man is a role model to millions of american men he beat a disease male pattern baldness
7888886 i like joe biden despite snide asides that hes been preparing a 500 000 word acceptance speech since iowa and the hair plug jokes
7888887 also america is no longer a place where citizens care about plagiarism or hair plugs
7888888 sam donaldson and his hair walk by presumably to interview joe biden and his hair
7888889 with tragedy sprinkled throughout his life hes earned every white hair fill in your own hair plug joke
7888890 in fact everything about biden from his hair plugs and capped teeth to his working class irish catholic upbringing to his extremely long tenure in the nations most exclusive club screams vain old white guy
7888891 biden has taken ribbing over the years for his changing hairline theres been talk about hair plugs since his first run for president in 1987
7888892 p lus the widespread rumor that his hair is not his own
7888893 its going to be wall to wall hair plugs today a continuous stream of joe biden
7888894 joe biden senator barack obamas vice presidential running mate is a career politician who has taken big contributions from lobbyists been mocked for his hair transplants and admitted plagiarising speeches and exaggerating his academic record
7888895 but the juxtaposition between rich romney and biden who bears a common touch from his hair plugs to his loafers probably wouldnt help mccain much
7888896 hes tan rested and thanks to exquisite teeth and some excellent hair plugs camera ready
7888897 and that leads to the easy warning that ive been telling friends for years never trust a man who gets hairplugs
7888898 bidens hair look it doesnt really matter okay but it was distracting joe needs to tell his barber to take a little more off the back and sides
7888899 i have to say his inability to shut up drives me up the wall but theres also an appealing lack of guile to the man he wears his flaws like his hair plugs out and proud
7888900 and the dubious distinction of becoming the first national party nominee with known hair plugs
7888901 the problem is that whereas obama is a young lightweight biden is an old lightweight obama with a hair transplant
7888902 there is no doubt he had hair transplants the guy is wearing barbies hair
7888903 i s there anyone that thinks that biden brings much of anything to this ticket aside from hair plugs and an over inflated sense of self worth that is
7888904 the selection of joe biden the oldest functioning white liberal senator with a foreign policy background who is catholic with hair plugs in the democratic party
7888905 joe biden now has an unfair advantage in the game of politics with hair that is not where god intended it to be its just so unfair to dick cheney
7888906 m aybe its because john mccains comb over tells you everything you need to know about the man and its not pretty
7888907 dave wineland is a prime reason why nist is a world renowned for atomic clocks and quantum computing research that advance u s science innovation and competitiveness
7888908 are looking at every family and background friend of the suspects and they will continue to do that until they hopefully capture these individuals
7888909 to get tunnel vision on where one suspect might be going we could actually miss the lead on another one
7888910 you placed me next to a black man i did not agree to sit next to someone from such a repugnant group give me an alternative seat
7888911 almost all the places on this flight are taken i will go to see if another place is available
7888912 madam just as i thought there are no other available seats in economy class i spoke to the captain amp he informed me that there is also no seat in business class all the same we still have one place in first class
7888913 it is unusual for our company to permit someone from economy class to sit in first class however given the circumstances the captain feels that it would be scandalous to make someone sit next to someone so disgusting
7888914 therefore sir if you would like to please collect your hand luggage a seat awaits you in first class
7888915 by accident or design following the withdrawal of unmee remains a reality

7888917 its important to be well rounded not purely scientific and analytical explore the arts poetry music decoupage a visual art form ive been developing since the first grade and remember its always better to have a cursory knowledge of a lot of things than to actually know a lot about any one thing this is called a liberal arts education
7888918 le protagoniste sono le stesse le donne che hanno condotto le battaglie degli ultimi trentanni e che ora stanno recuperando unidentit nuova facendo cos da apripista a un modo inedito di intendere la menopausa non pi come la fine della sessualit e linizio delluscita di scena anche estetica ma il tempo di una nuova libert reso ancora pi piacevole dallassenza di timori di gravidanze e dalla consapevolezza di essere ancora molto attraenti
7888919 queste donne non abdicano al fascino e alla seduzione lalfabeto della loro autonomia deriva dalle loro madri lincoraggiamento del talento dai padri le cinquantenni di oggi si distinguono per una migliore qualit dellinvecchiamento
7888920 come i maschi cinquantenni volgono lo sguardo verso le pi giovani a conferma della loro virilit e non resistono alla tentazione di esibirla le nuove cinquantenni svelano uninclinazione verso gli uomini pi giovani anche senza sbandierarla
7888921 amarsi alla mia et significa rimanere con il mio compagno appagata dal cammino che abbiamo fatto insieme
7888922 i 50 anni sono lo spartiacque tra la menopausa e la parte fertile della vita psicologicamente non un caso che una fase cos rivoluzionaria si apra proprio in quel momento
7888923 dal punto di vista sociale una cinquantenne di oggi non ha niente a che vedere col passato obiettivamente la trentenne di qualche generazione fa lo specchio le rimanda limmagine di una donna giovane capace di entusiasmi e sex appeal questa donna in passaggio che deve fare i conti con il dato biologico della menopausa ha una reazione di libert gli ormoni la privano di una certa parte di femminilit e lei reagisce risottolineando la femminilit ecco perch credo che le cinquantenni siano un potente polo dattrazione per maschi pi giovani con motivazioni diverse c chi ricerca una sessualit meno aggressiva chi attratto dalle dolcezze di una donna che passata dalla maternit chi si sente pi svincolato dagli impegni e dalle aspettative di una coetanea per questo sono convinto che queste donne tradiscano davvero pi delle trentenni o delle quarantenni quando si giovani la fedelt pesa molto nella costituzione della coppia a 50 anni invece si pu ripartire esattamente come molti maschi
7888924 le mie pazienti di 50 60 anni rivendicano con forza una sessualit gratificante

7888983 and i feel happy to have participated in such a huge competition
7888984 the most memorable time for me was being with my team mates and running for my country i felt so proud to represent costa rica at such a big event
7888985 i am young and if i train hard i can make it for the next olympics
7888986 i just need to keep training i just want to run and be fast
7888987 this is the highest thing any athlete can hope for
7888988 it has been a very happy experience for me i am proud to bring the somali flag to fly with all of these countries and to stand with the best athletes in the world
7888989 im satisfied with the result but also a bit annoyed with myself i definitely lacked experience compared to the others many of whom had been to at least two olympics before
7888990 the difference is they know how to handle the situation of being under pressure and shooting for medals
7888991 i didnt concentrate well pressure was very very high and luck was not by my side
7888992 but the whole issue being a part of the olympics was great being among the best 10 500 athletes in the world was an amazing experience
7888993 the organisation was excellent the accommodation food training possibilities the competition space the entertainment for the athletes everything worked like clockwork
7888994 the draw went very well for me on paper i should have been able to beat my opponents
7888995 i learnt a great deal during the games from other competitors techniques which i have already begun to build into my routine
7888996 i have felt very comfortable here and the chinese people have been very helpful and friendly
7888997 this is the first time for me to compete in such a big event and i feel very fortunate
7888998 my situation in cambodia is not good as you know i dont know if things will improve but i will lobby those in charge to make conditions better for sportsmen and women

7889093 one of the most profound and important victories available under our system of justice
7889094 defendants were represented at the supreme court by nine attorneys from three of the nations largest law firms and had access to all the legal resources provided by their own vast governmental budgets

7889136 to deny the existence of homosexuality in africa is like saying there never was an effort to push blacks out of their land so as to make them migrant labourers in the white mans cities
7889137 there have been many changes from the days barton smith my great great grandfather decided to export cutthroat razors to england
7889138 we started to sell guns and fishing tackle in the 1870s and 1880s and my grandfather had a contract to supply the army with guns in sligo in those years
7889139 we still use my fathers cutlery which dates back to 1927
7889140 that was dangerous work as it meant supporting the british army who were also dealing with david ben gurion as the state of israel was about to be established
7889141 in order to survive you have to adapt and that is how we have survived over the years i can recall days when there was less than 10 shillings in the till
7889142 the supermarkets hit the scene in the 1960s and we had to respond as we discontinued a number of products tools were now being sold in builders providers shops so we had to diversify into sports wear
7889143 we have to have three clear tests before it will be removed
7889144 the seven day rainfall was six times the normal amount for that time of year the specific problem of discolouration at kilsellagh reservoir resulted from an earthen bank collapse at side of the reservoir due to inundation of storm water
7889145 it is difficult to see how comprehensive measures to avoid this could be put in place without incurring massive costs
7889146 it is heartbreaking but football is heartbreaking at times you cant win every game but i couldnt fault their performance and i told them that after the match
7889147 you hurt from getting beat but you just have to pick yourself up and move on
7889148 i think a lot of teams come to st pats and go defensive but we didnt do that
7889149 we set out to play attacking football and i think we did of course its worrying that we didnt score its always worrying when we dont score unfortunately we dont have the personnel to score but thats an issue of money and spending
7889150 we will be playing against drogheda the same as we did against st pats fans dont want to see us play defensively we have to play good football we have to entertain the fans
7889151 i heard that cork city got 4 000 for their match at the weekend i dont know if we can get the same number but i am really hoping that the fans come out we need your help and we need your support its a massive game
7889152 for any town with a heroin problem the situation is very serious heroin is a serious drug that leads to serious crime
7889153 all you have to do is look at the big towns like carlow and athlone to see the consequences of heroin addiction both towns have shown a major increase in crime recently with the subsequent rise in availability of heroin
7889154 heroin addicts in sligo are typically in the late twenties mid thirties age bracket and are both male and female
7889155 we are even seeing the drug in places outside sligo town like tullaghan and kinlough
7889156 a lot of these people have come from various parts of the uk and are basing themselves in sligo
7889157 many of these people would have developed the habit while in prison the drug is sourced in the big cities like dublin and limerick
7889158 there is demand for heroin in sligo now the heroin suppliers will want to meet that demand the availability of the drug has definitely increased the supply wasnt there 12 months ago
7889159 as far as the road schedule shows the road schedule is our official road document that defines where a road starts and finishes it says that the road running north south between temple street and circular road is known as gallows hill
7889160 in fact this has been the official name of the road for the past 25 years
7889161 we have had representations from local councillors and a number of local residents who are saying that the name place st josephs terrace should not be changed or incorporated into the name gallows hill
7889162 we started this project in the town centre and you will notice several of these new street name signs around the town we are continuing this project in the areas just outside the town centre and the st josephs terrace and gallows hill area is one of those areas we have been looking at
7889163 we want to have all the official place name signs up and positioned on the end of each street so it will be in accordance with the official road schedule and will make it easier for tourists and people visiting to find their way around sligo
7889164 i dont have the exact figures but the salaries for both would come to a figure over 30 000 my constituency runs from charlestown to bundoran it is a massive area and i need all the help i can get to do that
7889165 my sister has been working with me anyway for many years and now she has been joined by my son
7889166 i have an office in manorhamilton which costs me in the region of 28 000 to run and that comes out of my own pocket i also run a constituency office in tubbercurry so it is a very big opera tion
7889167 i cant be at all the meetings in the constituency and there are so many queries so when you have family members it is ideal there are so many queries to deal with and you need to have a feel for it so who better than those who are very familiar with the job and its background
7889168 i am not in the same position as a td and i do employ my daughter who only does about 25 per cent of the work of my secretary whom i interviewed for the job
7889169 my daughter would not be earning anywhere near that amount and it would only be a fraction of the lowest figure quoted in the paper but i dont think there is anything wrong in tds hiring family members or relatives to work for them
7889170 if that person has already done a lot of effective work with constituents and is a very good asset then why shouldnt they be employed if you feel that you have someone who is eminently qualified for the job and you know they will be reliable then it makes sense to employ them and in a lot of cases that person is pretty well motivated and knows the political scene so the public representative knows what they are getting the public representative is in a unique position in that respect with a family member
7889171 on one occasion i received more than 80 cvs from a range of highly qualified people
7889172 we had the highest number of competitors ever for the warriors run this year usually the figure is around the 370 mark so we are absolutely delighted with the increase in numbers taking part in the competition
7889173 there was a fantastic crowd out to support the event and the day was enjoyed by all apart from one minor injury there were no major injuries reported on the day

7889178 we have experts coming to look at it this week and after that we should know what will be involved in repairing it
7889179 they are going to make a case to the opw office of public works for funding long term i think the feorish river needs remedial work it hasnt been touched in about 40 years and that is the real cause of the flooding because the water can get away quickly enough from geevagh or ballyfarnon

7889195 it means that people can come right into the centre of town in their boats tie up here and visit the area they can go off and do some shopping get supplies or go and get something to eat
7889196 as long as i have been involved in sailing sligo has been classed as a place to avoid because of the lack of access but now with the new jetty and the channel lit yachts will be able to come in and avail of the facilities of the town
7889197 there is no way galway can be a centre of excellence at any level at the moment we cannot cope with what we have
7889198 it just doesnt make sense to scrap cancer care services there and move them to a hospital that is quite clearly ill equipped to cope
7889199 and even if it was which it isnt at the moment it still isnt right to force cancer patients to make such a long and tiring trip for diagnosis and treatment
7889200 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7889201 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7889202 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7889203 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7889204 the agency started transferring money in the middle of august and expects to take a total of 400 million from other areas through the rest of the fiscal year which ends sept 30 such transfers have occurred several times since 2000

7889240 this was the second robbery our family endured in a few weeks
7889241 many old people are now living in fear because of these robberies
7889242 i am not blaming the individual gardai but surely they should increase their resources to combat these crimes
7889243 there were no gardai on duty in grange or cliffoney on the day of the break in this crime at our home happened between 2 30 and 5 30pm in broad daylight when we were away from home
7889244 when they arrived from sligo they told us not to touch anything until the fingerprints man arrived but that did not happen until 4pm on the following day this is simply not good enough
7889245 i have learned that on occasions one garda has to cover grange cliffoney and rosses point thats far too much for one man
7889246 it is not the fault of the gardai on the ground but surely their managers could give them more resources to deal with this growing problem
7889247 other suspects are being sought in relation to these crimes and further arrests are anticipated full technical scenes of crime examination to took place and results of same are await ing
7889248 it is the policy of an garda siochana to appraise injured parties on the progress of investigations of crimes of which they have been victims

7889280 one way of reducing energy costs is to ensure that equipment is more efficient and to introduce things like modern uninterruptible power supply systems
7889281 another is to reduce the load for power and cooling by utilising servers more fully as a server uses almost the same energy whether its running at 20 percent or 100 percent capacity
7889282 the issue is whose figures can you believe the trouble with the whole green debate is that there are no standards you can apply and there are very conflicting views depending on whom you talk to
7889283 its very difficult to make a judgement because you need independent comparisons based on workload and how youre using it and to work out things like energy savings and carbon footprint from that
7889284 its an area that isnt really considered today but it should be mainframes may take more energy to make but they last a long time while distributed systems may take less but probably only have a three year lifespan
7889285 the gold standard for utilisation is the mainframe because it runs diverse workloads on one system you can drive utilisation rates up and you need fewer servers to do it so power and cooling demands are reduced the latest z10 machines also include up to 64 engines and because theres not much difference between running one or 12 you can increase the number quite dramatically with little environmental impact

7889431 throughout his career the public and his co workers were as apt to see billy teaching safe chemical handling at a 4 h function as they were to see him delivering a keynote address at a national agronomic conference
7889432 hes sure not above helping out anyone on any level
7889433 hes the consummate agrilife extension professional and a fine example of what extension work is supposed to be all about which is people helping people
7889434 the dryland areas in the state were really suffering and the cotton responded to the rain almost all cotton was at or near cutout but had continued to bloom and some small squares were on the plant
7889435 if the cotton was under severe stress small bolls within seven to 10 days of blooming probably shed due to stress prior to the rain but squares will continue to develop and the cotton is likely blooming again
7889436 if there were not many bolls on the plant the plant will try to hold as many late developing bolls as possible if we have a warmer than usual fall and if we can stay away from early freezes the cotton should come back and produce an adequate yield
7889437 our irrigated cotton went into the rainy period with a heavy boll load in most areas
7889438 terry pitts oklahoma state university ipm specialist has been receiving calls and observing cotton fields with areas where leaves suddenly turn brown and dry up in the upper part of the plant
7889439 plant samples were obtained and taken to lubbock and it was determined the primary problem was a pathogen called alternaria dr terry wheeler plant pathologist texas agricultural experiment station and dr jason woodward texas agrilife extension plant pathologist identified the disease they said it was most common when late season cotton is suddenly subjected to a very wet period of rainfall and cooler temperatures for several days
7889440 theyre not a get out of jail card theyre not a silver bullet but they do offer some valuable alternatives to high cost nitrogen
7889441 a healthy stand of arrowleaf or crimson clover over seeded on warm season perennial grass pasture in east texas will provide a nitrogen input of up to 100 pounds of nitrogen per acre per year
7889442 however this is only accomplished through a grazing system with the recycling of animal waste youve got to be thinking in terms of recycling through animal grazing
7889443 clover will not directly provide nitrogen for the ryegrass in a ryegrass clover mixture it will provide nitrogen to the warm season grass that comes later through recycling
7889444 the clover rhizobium symbiosis is regulated by the amount of nitrogen available in the soil
7889445 the sandy acid soils of east texas are low in soil nitrogen but soil nitrogen increases if nitrogen fertilizer is applied if a clover ryegrass mix is planted and fertilized then the nitrogen fixation process will be slowed or turned off the ryegrass will do great but the clover will not contribute very much to the mix
7889446 this will give the early advantage to the clover which will start fixing nitrogen
7889447 a low rate of n 50 to 60 pounds per acre can be applied to the clover ryegrass mix in late december or january this will increase the ryegrass growth and allow the mix to efficiently fix and use nitrogen
7889448 bloat can be a problem but it is not limited to clovers
7889449 any fast growing cool season forage ryegrass wheat clover can cause bloat
7889450 some may be able to offer longer hours on four days of the week and potentially improve the access to patients

7889461 it seems as though people are firing from every courtyard in the town
7889462 there is a certain improvement in this arena in the last few weeks the measures have been tightened but the results are still far from satisfying because there are still smuggling tunnels

7889467 my only interest was to establish the truth im happy that the court has made its declaration of falsity and that the authors and publishers have recognised their falsehoods and apologised as far as i am concerned thats the end of the matter
7889468 many so called revelations about sir salmans home life his relationship with his wife son and interactions with police protection officers
7889469 in addition to the invasion of his privacy which this book represented of particular concern to the claimant were a series of utterly and demonstrably false statements which it contained
7889470 allegations of this nature are of course highly defamatory and they were particularly offensive to the claimant because they are simply not true
7889471 in fact as a number of his protection officers volunteered to testify in the event that this matter came to trial sir salman conducted himself with dignity and courtesy throughout a time of great personal danger and concern
7889472 they are also here to apologise unequivocally to sir salman rushdie as well as ms west for the hurt and damage which they have suffered as a result of the publication of these allegations
7889473 in view of sir salman rushdies belief in free expression he has uniquely in a british libel action not sought damages nor has sir salman asked for any opinions in the book to be altered only that the false and defamatory content be taken out
7889474 pioneered a new way of reconciling the right to freedom of speech with the right to reputation you nail the lie for all time with a court ordered declaration of falsity and you receive your legal costs but you decline to chill free speech by putting authors and publishers to an expensive trial and making them pay heavy damages
7889475 i am very gratified by the outcome it seems to me to have been an avoidable business the facts were not checked before publishing these allegations
7889476 my interest was solely to establish the truth over the number of serious allegations about myself elizabeth west and indeed about the behaviour of the police force
7889477 stand up in the high court and own up to being a liar
7889478 i hope it will be an original and new method by which to establish facts rather than going for enormous financial damages

7889481 its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7889482 but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7889483 the financial markets are currently going through their most turbulent period in years the credit crunch continues to bite the dollar is collapsing and taking the pound down with it and a uk recession seems an inevitability commodities prices are going haywire asias on the rise theres a lot for investors to keep on top of and its changing every day thats where the fleet street daily comes in a brand new 100 free service that keeps you plugged into the financial stories that really matter

7889506 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe
7889507 many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7889508 but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7889509 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely
7889510 what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections
7889511 one of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until theyre given insulin
7889512 the same is true with these mice however we found that if you take a diabetic rat thats not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic it almost catches up growthwise
7889513 i dont know how much of that will be filled with words as opposed to applause kidding kidding

7889566 the contribution of solar variability to global warming is negligible to a certainty of 95
7889567 the statistical variability in earths average temperature is interpreted as noise
7889568 the variations in earths temperature are not noise but contain substantial information about the source of variability
7889569 variations in tsi are indicative of the suns turbulent dynamics

7889572 both the fluctuations in tsi using the solar flare time series as a surrogate and earths average temperature time series are observed to have inverse power law statistical distributions
7889573 turns out to be the same for both the solar flare and temperature anomaly time series
7889574 the statistics of the temperature anomalies inherit the statistical structure that was evident in the intermittency of the solar flare data
7889575 the sun is influencing climate significantly more than the ipcc report claims
7889576 the current anthropogenic contribution to global warming is significantly over estimated

7889764 due to the increasing demand from our corporate customers for enterprise raid recoveries we needed to expand our cleanroom facility to manage our growth for today and the future

7889766 equipment can be replaced but files with thousands of hours of data cannot i told drivesavers that if you cant recover this data im going to have to retire
7889767 it felt like a miracle occurred when we received our data back
7889768 whether the brightest galaxies in clusters grew substantially in the last few billion years is intensely debated our observations show that in this time these galaxies have increased their mass by 50
7889769 most surprising is that in three of the four groups the brightest galaxy also has a bright companion galaxy these galaxy pairs are merging systems
7889770 the stars in these galaxies are already old and so we must conclude that the recent merging did not produce a new generation of stars
7889771 most of the stars in these galaxies were born at least 7 billion years ago
7889772 this study revealed a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7889773 type 1 diabetes occurs when the immune system destroys the insulin producing cells in the pancreas and one theory suggests that being born by caesarean section may affect the development of the immune system because babies are first exposed to bacteria originating from the hospital environment rather than to maternal bacteria
7889774 the study findings are interesting but unless a biological mechanism is established it would be unwise to read too much into this association between caesarean section delivery and diabetes
7889775 fortunately figures from the northern ireland type 1 diabetes register indicate that only around two per 1 000 children will develop diabetes by their 15th birthday so a 20 per cent increase is on quite a low baseline risk
7889776 not all women have the choice of whether to have a caesarean section or not but those who do may wish to take this risk into consideration before choosing to give birth this way
7889777 we are excited about this acquisition the strategic combination of our groups will accelerate the realization of our common aspiration that of becoming the most respected provider of business transformational services in the global marketplace we hold the management and employees of axon in high regard and look forward to welcoming them to the infosys group

7889830 we can confirm that five members of kings troop royal horse artillery london have provided positive samples following their units recent testing as part of the armys programme
7889831 internal administrative action has been taken against all five soldiers

7889834 goed georganiseerd kan hulp nochthans een grote bijdrage leveren aan armoedereductie en ontwikkeling
7889835 maar dan moet ze wel via de betrokken staten lopen en niet gebonden zijn aan voorwaarden zoals het aankopen van diensten en producten in het donorland of het invoeren van schadelijke economische hervormingen
7889836 bij het verdelen van hulp worden de overheden in het zuiden al te vaak gepasseerd er worden parallelle structeren opgezet dat zorgt ervoor dat de landen en parlementen in kwestie geen controle hebben over wat er met die hulp gebeurt
7889837 this governor general major general jeffery in the discharge of his constitutional responsibilities to the commonwealth has done so with dignity and with great aplomb and as members and senators we pay him due respect for having done so

7889855 if they are there then that is what the plan would be
7889856 thats not the way yip man would have done it
7889857 we dont believe that replacing the cpu is a good strategy supplementing the cpu is far better
7889858 i was determined if i was brought to court for something bogus then im going to be bogus about it
7889859 the critical community in this country needs the authority to do what ever is necessary to prevent the proliferation of these fictions of mass dumbification
7889860 for decades critics have been negotiating with authors and publishers irresponsibly using and inventing twenty point words like corsucating and unputdownable to describe books that definitely do not coruscate and are easily put down
7889861 the platitudinous hyperbole of our critical verbiage is typically transcended only by the conspicuous mediocrity of the literary subject this softly softly approach has reduced the ability of reviews to negatively impact sales and has only emboldened the authorists we need to strike preemptively exposing their plots and taking out their deus ex machinas before they can hit our shelves
7889862 and why did we give these gimps our attention in the first place
7889863 of course im going to win when i win im going to come in just long enough for you to kiss my ass
7889864 authors slap books up on amazon com all the time dont market them and sell zero copies
7889865 on a book that costs 24 95 the author gets at most 1 to 1 50
7889866 individual who gets paid ridiculous sums to give rim jobs to ceos and tell them that theyre going in the right direction
7889867 in an industry paul riddell oh and i almost forgot for the real entertainment read the comments to ms mitras original article at amazon could change publishing
7889868 you have no idea how long ive waited to say that
7889869 its been a long time coming but weve finally got industry wide agreement on how to deal with one of the most pervasive problems threatening our business
7889870 everyone whos ever worked in publishing has dreamed of finding that gem in the slushpile the next confederacy of dunces or skinny bitch diet but now with every subliterate numbskull with a blog thinking he can be the next doris lessing the gems are rare and getting rarer even the interns give up on the slush after a month or two of opening four pound packages containing six hundred pages of eighth grade drivel many big firms and imprints stopped accepting unagented submissions years ago but do you think that stops joe writer guy in poughkeepsie from sending out a thousand copies of the same submission to every editor he can find even if theyre in the same building were already renting containers on the docks to store all the memoirs we get and every once in a while one of those containers accidentally finds itself on a ship bound for a sneaker factory in china but it just isnt making a dent so this may and every may were not even going to check the post office box and anything that turns up at the office in a yellow envelope is going straight on the fire
7889871 our members are reporting that they receive as many as 50 000 submissions a year and thats just the stuff that arrives through the postal system it doesnt include the manuscripts that mysteriously find their way into editors handbags gym lockers and bedrooms
7889872 the slushpile is a growing problem for every publisher big or small mainstream or niche
7889873 granted every publishing company has its own submission guidelines and theyre not always obvious but really why would anyone think that a firm specialising in defence and intelligence reference material is going to want to publish a passionate story of lesbian awakening in the alaskan wilderness its a full time job just carting this stuff out to the dumpster i cant imagine what its like for the suckers at other companies that have to open and read it
7889874 gap between the number of people in the us who actually bother to read books and the number who submit books
7889875 all of the manuscripts with no merit other than the tag member sfwa
7889876 thats right anthrax and dutch elm blight maybe a bit of tobacco mosaic and some cane toad venom but anthrax was definitely involved somewhere of course considering the number of manuscripts weve received with any number of bodily fluids all over the envelope nobody will be surprised in the slightest
7889877 i hear from one writer who suggests that because of the delay in response to his submissions we call out hazmat teams to pluck his envelopes out of the incoming mail and decontaminate them before opening them i cant bring myself to tell him that we cant afford a hazmat team and each and every one of his stories makes me scrub my arms with carbolic acid whenever i open it each one of his stories literally takes away my will to live and i shudder every time i see his return address on an envelope and hes one of hundreds out there maybe thousands i have to buy elbow length rubber gloves on credit just to keep up
7889878 since the advent of the web weve been receiving material from people who apparently learned to type by throwing their cats at the keyboard and some of it is so horrible that we dont let it dare escape
7889879 some of it is so foul that weve decided to include hard drives in the bonfire because any hard drive or mail server that contained that story is obviously too contaminated for future use the new york fire department had problems with this at first due to environmental issues but when we explained the evil that would be removed from the universe by its extirpation they understood
7889880 the only publication that contained details was the american editors association newsletter rum sodomy and the lash and anyone who leaked the details to the general public was to be appointed the person in charge of dealing with the repercussions i myself am going into hiding in new zealand after this and im not returning to work until after ive had extensive cosmetic surgery
7889881 we decry any efforts to rid the world of our works and the esfwc amp cg will start up a geocities site to hold all of these orphaned stories until the new york literary establishment comes to its senses and buys them back for their full value
7889882 of course not theyre supposed to pay us for our work were not supposed to pay to get it published its not our fault that everyone submits stories but nobody pays to read the stories submitted and well all go to sfwa to complain if the magazines go under now go away i have a buffy farscape crossover novel that i have to get off to st martins this evening
7889883 australia has only six million people and between the four science fiction magazines in the country weve received submissions from at least four million either we have a lot of razorback hunters and crocodile skinners with plenty of free time in the evening who will suddenly buy subscriptions so they can see their stories in print or were going to have a bonfire of our own in our future
7889884 w eve been receiving material from people who apparently learned to type by throwing their cats at the keyboard
7889885 very few editors speak out about the quality and quantity of the material received
7889886 the da vinci code has been the publishing success story of the decade second only to well you know who
7889887 its sold more copies than we thought there were adults who still read books but there were some minor errors in the original edition little mistakes that slipped through the rigorous program of fact checking that dan did on his own work so now that the books been out there for five years and the sales finally seemed to have dropped off we felt this was the perfect time to bring out a revised edition with absolutely bullet proof historical detail the da vinci code 1 5 provides that and more with some new characters more chase sequences and a completely revised conspiracy
7889888 its true that i let a few little mistakes go in the first edition
7889889 factual errors about biblical history early christianity and judaism catholic theology egyptian mythology mithraism the origins and language of the new testament and gnostic gospels the nicene council emperor constantine the dead sea scrolls and nag hammadi texts the history and modern organizational structure of opus dei the history of the vatican interpretations of leonardos last supper and mona lisa leonardos sexuality the history of the knights templar the history and architecture of rosslyn chapel and the church of saint sulpice the history and geography of paris the location of versailles the position of curator of the louvre the design of the louvre pyramid the french education system the french language andorras rail system and propensity for seismic activity the geography of london and the procedures of the metropolitan police the astronomical position of venus the feasibility of a button sized gps tracking device the number of female victims of the inquisition the existence of a professorship of religious symbology at harvard university the existence of a scholarly discipline of religious symbology the origin of the word minstrel the ratio of male and female bees in a hive the secret agenda of disney films the number of words in job 38 11 the existence and supposed history of a priory of sion the physical characteristics of people with albinism to name a few and umm the divinity of jesus and the notion that there is any historical evidence at all that jesus had a sexual relationship with mary magdalene
7889890 but a few people have complained about them since the novel was first published weve corrected a few errors over the years in different editions but doubleday and i felt it was time we had another bite at the apple and release a new edition with enough changes that people would want to buy it again
7889891 oh sure when you take out all the factual errors baseless conjecture and flawed reasoning the whole storyline basically collapses all youre left with is a guy whos good at solving puzzles running around europe for no reason i dont even like europe the new version is entirely set in connecticut so i could fact check everything myself without having to drive more than two hours
7889892 i have personally verified every single fact in this new edition which doesnt reference anything that happened before 1985 it took most of a weekend
7889893 even though the only reference to leonardo vinci is the town he was from did you know that i didnt is a print of the mona lisa in robert langdons bedroom i know for a fact that he has a bedroom
7889894 it involves aliens lets see the bastards at wikipedia disprove
7889895 its true that i let a few little mistakes go in the first edition
7889896 factual errors about biblical history early christianity and judaism catholic theology egyptian mythology mithraism the origins and language subscribe to 101 reasons

7889924 traveller makes his or her own way whereas tourists paths have been beaten into submission long before they go whether singly or as a group there is nothing exclusive about tourism quite the contrary it is primarily inclusive it is an industry determined to embrace you it wants you to check in to the right hotels it wants you to spend as much as you can on fatuous souvenirs it wants you to do machu picchu or the taj mahal it wants you to have the rainforest experience or the mysterious east experience or the rose red city half as old as time experience and it doesnt rerribly mind if you also have the fleeced by muggers on copacabana beach experience and when your 15 days are up it want you to bugger off taking with you no local currency and maybe the odd disgusting parasite or two tourism apart we note how much modern travel writing and media interest now concerns journeys apparently influenced more by the guinness book of records than by a desire to travel per se
