4880033 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months

4880046 perhaps the sentiments contained in the following pages are not yet sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favor a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right and raises at first a formidable outcry in deference of custom but the tumult soon subsides time makes more converts than reason
4880047 assumptions can be dangerous especially in science they usually start as the most plausible or comfortable interpretation of the available facts but when their truth cannot be immediately tested and their flaws are not obvious assumptions often graduate to articles of faith and new observations are forced to fit them eventually if the volume of troublesome information becomes unsustainable the orthodoxy must collapse
4880048 when health is absent wisdom cannot reveal itself art cannot become manifest strength cannot be exerted wealth is useless and reason is powerless
4880049 he who enjoys good health is rich though he knows it not

4880051 to keep the body in good health is a duty otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear
4880052 if you have health you probably will be happy and if you have health and happiness you have all the wealth you need even if it is not all you want
4880053 the next major advance in the health of the american people will be determined by what the individual is willing to do for himself

4880060 i spoke today by phone with georgian president mikheil saakashvili about russias moves to undermine georgian sovereignty over two secessionist regions
4880061 some argued against providing a membership action plan map to georgia at the recent nato summit in bucharest because it might anger russia while there was no consensus for map for georgia russia chose to act provocatively nevertheless we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty georgia has acted with restraint in its response and should continue to do so i hope that european leaders along with international organizations such as the organization for security and cooperation in europe and the united nations will join in strongly condemning russias move

4880073 if you dont drink enough your body thinks its in danger and tries to hold on to all the water it can get the water is stored between the cells and shows up as extra weight

4880075 the most important risk factor for overweight and obesity was skipping breakfast say the researchers
4880076 weight loss is a slow difficult process but one that can be made easier if you are ready to address many areas of your life and if you are willing to reach out for support from health professionals friends and family members

4880088 este era un proyecto que deber a haber comenzado a ejecutarse en el mes de septiembre del a o reci n pasado pero en esa oportunidad el dinero cercano a los 270 millones de pesos fueron insuficientes para los trabajos solicitados por lo que tuvimos que realizar gestiones en el ministerio para lograr mayor cantidad de recursos y tambi n nosotros como municipio tambi n ya depositamos el aporte comprometido y que no es menor pues supera los 36 millones de pesos
4880089 lamentamos que justamente los trabajos se inicien cuando las familias estaban comenzando a asistir por las tardes al sector pero es un tema que escapa a nuestra competencia lo fundamental es que los trabajos se inician la plaza se cierra y en 6 meses m s aproximadamente tendremos un nuevo paseo p blico m s hermoso y ordenado que queremos sea el centro de encuentro de las familias especialmente de los ni os

4880093 we intend to fight for it in the senate the liberal party appears to be siding with big oil who dont want consumers to know where they can get the cheapest petrol in any price cycle

4880095 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
4880096 india are looking to have uranium for clean energy purposes by 2050 35 per cent of all of their power needs could be met by nuclear energy and that would save an enormous amount in terms of greenhouse gasses
4880097 it is the one policy thing that prime minister kevin rudd could do which would have more impact than anything else in australia to lower global greenhouse gas emissions

4880109 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
4880110 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
4880111 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
4880112 but this time the explosion came so abruptly i dont remember what happened afterward
4880113 our neighbor thinks it can fight us we are telling it no
4880114 we do not want to believe that the united states has given a green light to this adventurous act
4880115 but our american colleagues are telling us that theyre investigating now what may have happened in the channels of communication for mr saakashvili to have behaved in such a reckless manner
4880116 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those military operations really do now need to stop because calm needs to be restored
4880117 ossetians and abkhaz must respond to that question taking their history into account including what happened in the past few days
4880118 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4880119 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4880120 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4880121 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4880122 otherwise dont do much logging because it will hurt application performance sometimes drastically
4880123 yes im still running even though i havent done anything else lately
4880124 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club but citys future is not in jeopardy we dont rely on dr thaksins money
4880125 i could have stayed at blackburn for four five or six years and i wouldnt have experienced the pressure or demands or expectations i have here but this is what i wanted its why i made the change
4880126 i know exactly the way i work and the way my staff work and well turn this place around well be going in the right direction
4880127 theres a little distraction off the field but that wasnt the reason we were beaten the other night they were football things not business things
4880128 were trying to change the players physically and mentally but that cant happen overnight
4880129 we have needed more of a presence in midfield i think we relied too much on barry ferguson in that department mendes can take the ball and use it as you saw today
4880130 i wouldnt say i was surprised that he went because he had an outstanding season last time out and getting to the uefa cup final brought him to the notice of many people
4880131 we wouldnt have got the player if it hadnt been for that clause we were disappointed that he went but not surprised we knew it could happen but hoped it wouldnt be the case we would have liked him to stay for another year
4880132 youve got to score from chances like that and we didnt
4880133 it was frustrating for me and the longer the game went on the more i began to worry that it would come back to haunt us when you are so dominant in terms of territory and possession theres always a danger that something like that will happen
4880134 im not doing an arsene wenger i genuinely missed it but ill look at it again on the video
4880135 you cant go about like that in scottish football but well have a wee whisper in his ear
4880136 whether he changes or not is up to him it depends how big his bank balance is as for the game i dont think mark will be too happy at losing because they were the better side for the first hour
4880137 we lost 14 games away from home last season and it cost us in the end so its good to get off the mark here
4880138 hes got everything and left back is a problem position for teams all over the world
4880139 i think the bids came in as expected and with a bit of surprise
4880140 i think they will come in under that then the question is how much can we afford
4880141 we of course have concern about costs but secondarily we have concerns about energy savings were expecting a return on the investment as energy costs go up it appears we may need to invest more and at the same time our returns will be greater
4880142 we think were gong to have to decide reasonably quickly the sooner we decide the sooner we get a return on investment
4880143 its just to promote the draft horses the big plow horses thats why were in the parade
4880144 some people go golfing some go hunting we take the horses out into the field and plow for an hour or two
4880145 this is our 10th year a decade of darkness thats our theme
4880146 people are pretty happy with it id say its 100 percent positive but that never happens but everybody thats talked to me has been happy with it
4880147 we wanted to keep as much of the original detail as possible but have a building that was useful for modern needs that was the tricky part
4880148 we didnt want anything visible outside that wouldnt have been here in 1887 we wanted it too look as much like the original picture as possible
4880149 with all the technology and furnishings well still get in here for less than 3 million really were going to get about 200 000 in equipment we didnt figure wed be able to get
4880150 we should be able to have it paid off in five or six years so id say by 2010 2011 at the latest
4880151 it will probably be another month or so were working on issues with the door locks cameras phones and other things im guessing sometime in september trust me everybodys ready

4880153 he was a decent kid he would give you the shirt off his back if he had to he called me every other day mom do you need anything
4880154 everybody loved him at the funeral parlor it was around the corner there were so many kids that liked him he was a good kid
4880155 i dont know maybe he needed it more i just thought about it maybe he needed it more
4880156 just to get him a resting place i dont have a lot of money so it was hard for me so thats all im just trying to get a little help
4880157 you can almost equate it to a convenience store it doesnt make any money selling gas a penny here a penny there the margins are slim they make their money on selling candy cokes to the consumer
4880158 you sell ethanol to cover your costs your ddg is your revenue and your profit margin
4880159 its simple to try and equate high corn prices with an ethanol gold rush
4880160 its complicated to understand the reality which is the rising price of oil and the weak dollar which directly relates to high commodity prices because theyre traded in u s dollars those are the real issues
4880161 hardin county farmers were a month behind this spring with the cool wet weather farmers couldnt plant if they get a killing frost before nov 1 there will be a lot of corn lost
4880162 im sure the price of oil is a bigger factor than the price of corn
4880163 its permitting us to develop new technology but i dont see corn going away
4880164 weve got a plant in iowa working on replacing half its fuel with a woodchip boiler and the other half with methane from a landfill
4880165 we have a federal grant to help fund research on using corn cobs
4880166 if we used 100 percent of our corn for fuel and 100 percent of our soybeans for diesel that would still be a lower percentage of total fuel used in this country
4880167 nobody is saying we can grow all of our gasoline thats not the way well be driving automobiles 200 years from now
4880168 hes got a lot of talent if you just watch the raw talent you see a guy with size speed excellent hands and hes learning two or three positions right now hes cross training which is really hard
4880169 he doesnt get flustered and come unglued when something bad happens normally in a game something bad is going to happen
4880170 he has shown tremendous poise youre a rookie you come in here from college and youre playing tackle and youre moving to center and then youre right guard and then youre left guard youre going up against this defense and the multiplicity that they have were audibling were changing plays
4880171 there would be disappointment if he didnt do as well
4880172 we scouted him well some guys are robotic he just gets it dont send him to the hall of fame yet but for right now the arrow is pointing in the right direction
4880173 i know thats one of the things that separates people in the nfl how they are from the neck up im just trying to focus on that aspect a lot because everybody is physically talented so thats whats going to separate you from the next man
4880174 earnest graham will be our starting halfback he certainly deserves it
4880175 you have warrick dunn a guy that is going to be a huge contributor here and will compete for that position
4880176 depth charts right now are in pencil and i think that is fair to our football players

4880182 there is an important issue of freedom of speech at stake sadly i cannot speak about it at this early stage because i have already engaged lawyers
4880183 i know that a lot of thought went into this
4880184 its a terrible shame he made those comments and he has been given a full opportunity to take them back however he hasnt
4880185 lets hear more about your evidence and less about your legal muscle
4880186 spinal adjustment should not be limited to treatment of musculoskeletal problems
4880187 there appears to be little evidence to support the value of spinal manipulation for nonmusculoskeletal conditions
4880188 as a south louisiana resident myself who rode out the storm only to face the devastation of stalled recovery efforts and endless bureaucratic red tape this method has helped me reshape my mood and focus on a more positive approach to solving the problems regardless of who is to blame
4880189 we think suffering thoughts all day long and live our lives as though these thoughts are actually true added carter
4880190 but there is a way out of the resulting sadness anger frustration and fear its the work i have found no other tool that is as simple and has such insightful results
4880191 we are sinners in the hands of an angry god
4880192 rejecting the failed theology of liberalism discredited by the devastation of two wars
4880193 seeing how they are rebuilding and how historical landmarks sculptures and plantations withstood the pounding are paramount to understanding the long term impact of these storms on both our physical and cultural landscape
4880194 we just had the second holiday season since the onslaught of the devastation yet the obstacles and the setbacks persist
4880195 because maidas stories and personal photos share the resilience of south louisianans her perspective and insight are needed now more than ever to keep this journey back on the national radar
4880196 weve had incredible feedback on the photo essay series we began in early october with nature photographer matthew white we hope to continue adding valuable content to tell the whole story of these storms

4880222 the growth for the quarter was driven by improvements at shopzilla that allowed the business to more efficiently increase and monetize user traffic the increase was primarily attributed to paid session growth derived from an increase in bidding on keywords shopzillas net revenue when considering search marketing costs incurred increased 34 for the first quarter of 2008 compared with the first quarter of 2007
4880223 we continue to focus on making improvements to the consumer experience at shopzilla and driving traffic to the site and we plan to continue to operate uswitch with a pared down cost structure to better manage through the changes in energy switching activity we have experienced in recent periods

4880225 how can we grow our traffic 30 next month and continue improve merchant roi
4880226 our main focus is on the user we provide them with all the information they need before clicking through to a merchants product page the target audience is someone whos in the middle of the buying process typically weve found that customer written recommendations are the most useful in accelerating the decision process and deliver increased conversion rates for merchants
4880227 we see ourselves more as a shopping community than a pure price comparison site
4880228 give people all the information they need to make ideal buying decisions

4880233 n o sinto press o nenhuma tenho confian a em quem eu sou e em quem s o meus pais farei o melhor que eu posso declarou serena recentemente
4880234 s la experiencia cuenta pero igual hay que aplicarse m s dentro de la cancha no podemos regalar nada me parece que todos podemos dar un poco m s y el equipo lo necesita individualmente trabajar de otra forma
4880235 no no es normal por supuesto que no para un equipo como toluca pero as es la realidad est en nosotros cambiarlo lo bueno es que s lo depende de nosotros de nadie m s entonces debemos seguir trabajando mentalizarnos al doble que siempre hemos sido ganadores
4880236 si todos los partidos fueran como el primer tiempo no nos preocupar a pero la realidad es otra tenemos que ser inteligentes analizar y no caer en desesperaciones todo lo contrario saber que el domingo tenemos un partido que podemos ganar y mejorar la situaci n un triunfo nos vendr a mejor que un empate eso est claro
4880237 despu s de tanto tiempo de estar en este deporte y jugar desde los cinco a os entiendo que dejar con un hombre menos a tu equipo siempre es contraproducente
4880238 entonces no me preocupa o me hace pensar que soy un tipo agresivo como para recibir una expulsi n cada cinco partidos pues m s all de eso nunca tuve problemas con demasiadas tarjetas rojas o sumar gran cantidad de amonestaciones ahora hay que mirar hacia adelante y ser m s inteligente para evitar expulsiones

4880241 the tour has been going great every night is a highlight we are really enjoying playing on this arena tour everyone has been so nice we are having a blast both onstage and off i have been playing my charvel guitar with the skulls a lot on this tour
4880242 it has been great not only have i noticed the fans singing along to our older hits songs but they know the words to the new stuff as well for example when i look out there in the audience and see the kids singing the words to standing on the outside it is exciting from the response from the crowd standing on the outside is already a dokken classic for some reason the chemistry between don and i performing on this tour has been the best yet we have been working together for a long time
4880243 the only downfall to playing on the arena tour is the limited set list we have a 40 minute set i dont get to extend my solos at all which at the clubs we get to play a longer set it is difficult to decide which songs to take out we just played to a packed at northern lights in clifton park ny and we performed a lot of the dokken classics the east coast tour has featured some of the top named arena venues in the country they were packed every night i dont think there is any difference there is a 80s revival all over the country
4880244 i just worry that when your book comes out youll forget all about me and my italian neorealist face you being the voice of our generation and all
4880245 my dad had leukemia it got him his grandfather got pancreatic cancer its everywhere
4880246 obamas start has been just fine you dont hit a ball our of the park on the first two pitches
4880247 after reading his book it is significant how much of influence his grandmother was raising him i think he should have mentioned his mother but she is gone so cant advise him now michelle is a huge influence on him and should be mentioned answering that they are others is a smart move as to who he will look to for more information and influence him but he seeks much information from either those he doesnt agree with very different from our present president
4880248 it was a warm reception which i was happy to see
4880249 so far hes mostly being safe without holding back of course naming his wife and grandmother is safe but naming dick logan and colbert as people whose advice he sought werent exactly safe picks
4880250 how can we judge what one persons greatest moral failure is
4880251 one person with a drug or alcohol issue directly affects the health and well being of approximately 20 other people directly and indirectly id say thats enough damage perhaps he doesnt consider a wrong decision an
4880252 the challenge was to create a site with a clean flow and design better usability and increased usefulness to members and travelers visiting the site we are very happy to have met those goals finishing on time and on budget to give the canandaigua wine trail just what they needed before the fall tourist trade arrived
4880253 i was shocked by how quickly he came up with clarence thomas it seemed like knee jerk liberalism on display scalia was the safer answer and he should have gone there first
4880254 i agree regarding thomas always felt he was not sufficiently qualified i would oppose scalia as he is exceedingly conservative
4880255 i agree with both choices thomas should never have been nominated to the court he simply did not and does not have the legal mind or the skill set necessary for this particular position and scalia is just an angry man with a neo con agenda appointed by reagan for that fact more than any other
4880256 standard liberal philosophy it suggests being able to change the constitution at the justices perception of social conditions as they now exist rather than the legal demands set up by those who drafted the constitution and provided procedures to ammend the document as social changes required
4880257 im glad you liked it mine tasted a little bit like kielbasa
4880258 i find his effort at the beginning to be humble and gracious he seems to be backing in to the program
4880259 it is politically safe but for the more sophisticated there are many that are more important and significant the idea hes going to his grandmother for advice is absurd
4880260 i think most people addicted to drugs would consider it significant a person refusing or unable to define his real moral failures example faillure to admit stupidity and ignorance in critical issues e g iraq surge socialism racial bias intellectual deceptiveness at harvard in failure to publish a single note
4880261 naming his mother grandmother may be safe but i think its true my children who are in their 40s many times come to me for advice
4880262 moral failure well hes kind of young and seems to be dedicated to his wife so its entirely possible that his greatest failure so far was experimenting with drugs drinking in his teens
4880263 jag ska aldrig igen uttala mig om att brottare r barnsliga
4880264 i didnt know where to go so they kind of escorted me over the tracks

4880274 as lo vemos todos en el equipo pero ante necaxa debemos estar alertas porque tienen siempre la misma forma de jugar aguantan muy bien desdoblan con rapidez lo cual considero debemos cuidar mucho

4880278 pero igual tienen a sandoval el negro a robert de pinho que va a pelear todas y otros jugadores que intentar n hacer da o pero principalmente es el pony quien m s desequilibra
4880279 creo que nosotros debemos dejar de preocuparnos de los rbitros hay que hacer un buen partido y ya el rbitro pasar a segundo t rmino de nuestra parte hacer lo nuestro hay que jugar bien y sacar los tres puntos
4880280 no habr marca especial pero es alguien que a lo mejor ahora va intentar hacer m s de lo que normalmente est haciendo va a querer mostrar algo m s y hay que estar muy atentos

4880371 especially when you look at the programs it is going to that are based on fear shame gender stereotypes and misinformation as well as cpcs which are very thinly veiled religious organizations it is clear that these funds are not about improving the health of young people in kentucky but rather in supporting a certain ideological enterprise at the taxpayers expense
4880372 it is time for kentucky to join many other states in refusing this failed experiment of abstinence only until marriage programs as long as funds are going to these programs that place ideology over what the evidence says works young people and other underserved groups in kentucky are going to continue to suffer

4880491 if magnets were effective they would offer a cheap and probably safe treatment option
4880492 the cost of bracelets around 30 50 compares well with that of analgesics paracetamol 20 a year
4880493 larger investigations should now test the safety of magnets relative to the well known risks of analgesics
4880494 we funded this study because we wanted to establish if there was any evidence for the claims made on behalf of magnetic bracelets and we didnt want the public to waste their money on devices that didnt work
4880495 results appear to show that wearing a magnetic bracelet does reduce pain in people with hip and knee osteoarthritis although it is still unclear whether this effect is due in some part to the placebo effect
4880496 as magnetic bracelets are quite cheap and safe people with osteoarthritis might want to consider wearing them as part of their self help regime

4880527 based on a candidates support or opposition to an issue that impacts people with disabilities
4880528 it would require asking very sensitive questions in a survey which would lead respondents to hang up
4880529 i think people with disabilities vote just like anyone else does
4880530 i think they vote on big issues like war in iraq and the economy like others
4880531 it goes to the candidate who talks most about disability
4880532 i think the more people know that he has a disability the more it is likely to help with this community
4880533 it was surprising that given doles ada sponsorship and disability that he did not carry disabled voters
4880534 i think that was because clinton was the first president to establish an office in the to work on disability he had a very strong record it was the first time we had seen anything like that
4880535 the only party that is really addressing that is the and everyone in our community knows that

4880570 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4880571 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4880572 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

4880592 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
4880593 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4880594 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4880595 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4880596 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4880597 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4880598 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
4880599 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4880600 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4880601 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4880602 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4880603 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4880604 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4880605 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4880606 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4880607 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4880608 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4880609 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4880610 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4880611 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4880612 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable
4880613 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile

4880619 el art culo 53 es una herramienta de lucha para el pueblo mapuche
4880620 referente a los derechos humanos suiza es la capitalde la cruz roja suiza nunca tuvo colonias a nivel estatal
4880621 nuestra vinculacion con la pelicula est en que el empresario domenico panciotto viene de suiza y la realizadora fausta quattrini es suiza
4880622 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4880623 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4880624 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4880625 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4880626 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4880627 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4880628 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4880629 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena
4880630 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4880631 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4880632 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4880633 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4880634 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4880646 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4880647 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4880648 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4880649 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4880650 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4880651 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4880652 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4880653 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4880654 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4880655 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4880656 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4880657 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4880658 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4880659 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4880663 but government ministers have a responsibility to base policy on science and i do strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to the developing world to ask the question can gm crops help
4880664 its easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can

4880684 the entire route of the btc the only major oil pipeline from the caspian region outside of russias control should now be treated as high risk and turkeys viability as an energy bridge to europe has been thrown into question
4880685 russia has a very clear strategy and would prefer europes gas to go via russia and not via independent countries there is no definite attempt by russia to disrupt supplies but it is not unhelpful to russia that there is unrest
4880686 could render further foreign investment in any oil and gas transport links that bypass russia too risky

4880698 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4880699 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4880700 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4880701 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4880702 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4880703 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4880704 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4880705 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4880706 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4880707 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4880708 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4880709 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4880710 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4880711 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4880712 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4880713 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4880714 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4880715 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4880716 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4880717 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4880718 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4880719 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4880720 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4880721 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4880722 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4880723 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4880724 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4880725 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4880726 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4880727 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4880728 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4880729 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4880730 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4880731 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4880732 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4880733 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4880734 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4880735 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4880736 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4880741 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4880742 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4880743 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4880744 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4880745 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4880746 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4880747 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4880748 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4880749 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4880750 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4880751 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4880752 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4880753 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4880754 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4880755 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4880756 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4880757 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4880758 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4880759 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

4880821 increasingly focused on the dollars value as it appears more and more that oil may have entered a consolidative phase
4880822 rapidly rising oil prices during the first half of the year have given rise to inflationary fears
4880823 a rising dollar makes oil more expensive all around not only in nominal dollar valuations but more and more of a local currency is required to obtain the dollars needed to pay for the oil
4880824 currency price fluctuations can only have so much affect on energy price direction
4880825 i think weve already seen the damage done to oil via a falling euro and strengthening u s dollar

4880863 from its trailer and description it sounds suspiciously like a hokey concoction ala al gores an inconvenient truth put together by louis xvis financial ministers on the eve of the storming of the bastille blaming all our troubles on sunspots or the humble snail darter
4880864 the premier will also feature a live panel discussion after the film of distinguished experts filling in to the suckers who viewed this fiasco what they just saw they include peterson walker billionaire investor warren buffet and cato institute chairman william me too niskanen

4880903 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4880904 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

4880907 women far outnumber men as victims of intimate partner violence and intimate partner violence is deadlier for women what do i base this on try reading the justice departments studies which are conducted impartially and which are based on police reports fbi reports and the national crime victimization survey what does the justice department say about intimate partner violence that women are victims of violence by intimate partners far more often than are men how much more often well according to the justice department which oughta know 85 of intimate violence is committed against women only 5 15 of intimate violence is committed against men and please be sure to notice that that figure includes same sex violence
4880908 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
4880909 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns

4880925 it would appear that there was a mis configuration on the mysql server where your database is hosted normally we turn off reverse dns lookups on the mysql server but this was not the case compounding the issue it appears that the dns servers configured on the database server were also incorrect thus mysql was trying to do a reverse dns lookup on your websites ip address however it could not do so due to the fact that the dns server configuration was incorrect this is what was causing the time outs on your site our infrastructure technicians have updated the servers configuration and everything appears to be operating as normal
4880926 it doesnt have to look the same in every browser
4880927 we dont have a gasoline price problem we have an addiction problem we are addicted to dirty fossil fuels and this addiction is driving a whole set of toxic trends that are harming our nation and world in many different ways it is intensifying global warming creating runaway global demand for oil and gas weakening our currency by shifting huge amounts of dollars abroad to pay for oil imports destroying plants and animals at record rates
4880928 a sustainable society is one that satisfies its needs without diminishing the prospects of future generations

4880967 our school is a mess oh my i hope seb cleans that up
4880968 if you always give what your body wants it can become your enemy
4880969 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
4880970 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
4880971 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
4880972 armed gangs of the abkhazian separatist regime together with units of the russian regular army shifted the administrative border of abkhazia towards the enguri river
4880973 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4880974 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4880975 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4880976 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4880977 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4880978 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4880979 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4880980 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4880981 you always think what could i have done different what could i have done better what could i have done to help more
4880982 shes one of those examples of not just talking but doing
4880983 she does a lot of things very quietly not for recognition and not for thank yous she does it because she genuinely believes in the community and sees good in everybody
4880984 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4880985 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4880986 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4880987 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4880988 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4880989 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4880990 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4880991 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4880992 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4880993 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4880994 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4880995 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4880996 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4880997 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4880998 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4880999 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4881000 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4881001 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4881002 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4881003 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4881004 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4881005 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4881006 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
4881007 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4881008 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4881009 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
4881010 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
4881011 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4881012 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4881013 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4881014 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4881015 when you lie down with dogs you come up with fleas
4881016 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4881017 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4881018 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4881019 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4881020 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4881021 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4881022 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4881023 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4881024 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4881025 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4881026 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4881027 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4881028 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4881029 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4881030 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4881031 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4881032 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4881033 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4881034 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4881035 ever since barack obama first ascended the national stage at the 2004 democratic convention pundits have been tripping over themselves to point out the difference between him and the average joe from the south side
4881036 he has no past he simply appears one day to help the white protagonist
4881037 colorblind barack obama would be the great black hope in the next presidential race if he were actually black
4881038 just as the negro friendly bill clinton had to gamble on retaining that base while reassuring whites that he knew how to keep blacks in line so mr obama has to reassure blacks he is unafraid to tell whites things that whites decidedly do not want to hear he didnt attain power through traditional black channels thats partially why whites can embrace him but blacks fear that one day hell go tiger woods on us and get all race transcendent
4881039 a hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles
4881040 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4881041 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4881042 moving to the talisma crm is a giant step forward for us
4881043 our existing system did not offer us the advanced capabilities we
4881044 now russia needs to honour the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4881045 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4881046 by deploying poland is exposing itself to a strike 100
4881047 it is rare that all the blame is on one side in fact both sides are probably to blame that is very important to understand
4881048 profound implications for russia this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4881049 you cant be a responsible member of institutions which are democratic and underscore democratic values and on the other hand act in this way against one of your neighbours
4881050 russia has every time been testing the reaction of the west its going to replicate what happened in georgia elsewhere
4881051 we are looking evil directly in the eye today this evil is very strong and very dangerous for everybody not just for us
4881052 georgia has been attacked russian forces need to leave georgia at once
4881053 must take place and take place now this is no longer 1968
4881054 our ground forces never crossed the border of the conflict zone
4881055 but the problem is that the abkhazians and the ossetians do not trust anyone except russian peacekeepers
4881056 this clearly demonstrates the deployment of new anti missile forces in europe has as its aim the russian federation
4881057 and captains of work must always be but there is a wide difference between being captains of work and taking the profits of it
4881058 even a great mistake a lifelong mistake and perhaps as long as eternity too
4881059 so are you saying that were all just like really excellent sheep
4881060 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4881061 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4881062 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4881063 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4881064 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4881065 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4881066 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4881067 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4881068 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4881069 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4881070 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4881071 hed be a good man on a boat during a storm
4881072 obama does better against mccain with hunters and especially fisherpeople than did his two democratic predecessors vis a vis bush
4881073 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4881074 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4881075 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4881076 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4881077 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4881078 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4881079 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4881080 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4881081 i can tell you from my experience that most of the time media speculation turns out to be wrong
4881082 im staying as governor whether you like it or not
4881083 the lieutenant governor might not like it very much but im staying
4881084 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
4881085 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4881086 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4881087 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4881088 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4881089 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4881090 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4881091 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4881092 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4881093 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4881094 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4881095 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4881096 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4881097 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4881098 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4881099 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4881100 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4881101 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4881102 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4881103 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4881104 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4881105 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4881106 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4881107 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4881108 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4881109 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4881110 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4881111 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4881112 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4881113 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4881114 caracas puede dejar de ser urbe y convertirse en una megal polis
4881115 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4881116 implicating a sanitation worker who may have accidentally caused an ethernet cable to become detached
4881117 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4881118 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4881119 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4881120 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4881121 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4881122 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4881123 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4881124 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4881125 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4881126 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4881127 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4881128 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4881129 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4881130 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4881131 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4881132 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4881133 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4881134 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4881135 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4881136 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4881137 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4881138 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4881139 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4881140 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4881141 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4881142 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4881143 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4881144 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4881145 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4881146 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4881147 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4881148 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4881149 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4881150 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4881151 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4881152 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4881153 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4881154 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4881155 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4881156 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4881157 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4881158 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4881159 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
4881160 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
4881161 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
4881162 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
4881163 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
4881164 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
4881165 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
4881166 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
4881167 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4881168 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4881169 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4881170 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4881171 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4881172 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4881173 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4881174 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4881175 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4881176 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4881177 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4881178 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4881179 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4881180 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4881181 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4881182 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4881183 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4881184 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4881185 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4881186 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4881187 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4881188 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4881189 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4881190 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4881191 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4881192 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4881195 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4881196 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4881197 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4881198 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4881199 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4881200 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4881201 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4881202 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet

4881219 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4881220 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4881221 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4881222 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4881223 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4881224 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4881225 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4881226 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4881227 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4881228 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4881229 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4881230 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4881231 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4881232 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4881233 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4881234 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4881235 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

4881242 ive been drifting on this wave so long i dont know if its already crashed on the shore
4881243 i dont think we live in a communist country we will do what is commercially appropriate what is prudent
4881244 therefore i dont know of any legislation that says that the reserve bank actually sets interest rates for commercial operations in this country
4881245 the public have a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4881246 were in a situation where the reserve bank increases obviously had an impact on the 90 day bill rate and there has been a significant margin built up over that bill rate over the last 12 months and then when you look at the offshore funding costs particularly on the longer dated funding it was a significant increase of up over 100 basis points
4881247 so we ended up in a situation where we under recovered about 16 basis points on average on mortgages

4881255 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4881256 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

4881270 some of our operations like the document processing centre have been operating on a round the clock basis so we shall be expanding this concept to other operations
4881271 we are re allocating duties to staff and reorganising other resources and we may start round the clock operations even before the seven day deadline
4881272 these results are good and reflective of the difficult operating and economic regulatory climate
4881273 however we will continue to focus on being efficient and deliver excellent service to our customers
4881274 our borrowing level sits comfortably with the 60 capital structure efficiency level providing additional borrowing capacity
4881275 we have kept our eyes on the prize and used some of the revenue generated to ensure we can pay for our debt and to ensure we can borrow more

4881282 the boat was hit by a storm and all of the men were thrown overboard
4881283 whatever you want it to have been thats what it was
4881284 no bill i really want to know im asking you a question man
4881285 youre jimi hendrix it just surprised me that you would do that
4881286 well youve got to be aware by now of the fact that youre so popular and your fans are so into your work that they will be happy for whatever you give them but jimi arent you also aware of the fact that youve gotten to the point where you did everything out there tonight but remember to play
4881287 look at all the moves you made think about the songs you played there
4881288 did you hear the ovation man they went fucking nuts
4881289 you could have brought out the guitar and pissed on that stage and for them it would have been a thrill
4881290 but under his breath he was also mad at himself he never yelled at me i think it had finally clicked in with him that
4881291 i told you im going to be here ill check it out
4881292 then he is building us a protest movement what have we got now
4881293 obamas going around issuing promissory notes on the future that he cant possibly redeem promises to heal the world with negotiations with the likes of irans president ahmadinejad
4881294 are the wealthy the engines of progress of economic growth you used to say it was the marketplace ordinary people with money in their hands well informed making their own decisions driving economic growth only the wealthy who served them would prosper and the rest would fade away now you say bypass the ordinary people and give money directly to the wealthy all of them not because they serve but just because theyre rich what good does that do could you please defend that policy
4881295 putting the fun in functional applying game mechanics to social software
4881296 kids listen protect them with straight talk about the health benefits of vaporizers
4881297 steve do you often date girls and not try to sleep with them

4881299 ambassador magma despite his robot like appearance is not a robot but actually a living giant forged from gold
4881300 both legs and his right arm and wrist wrist were broken in several places
4881301 he had severe injuries to his chest his abdomen and his spinal column
4881302 i was stunned that somebody would say something like that i aint that fat i only weigh 277
4881303 in recent months the deputy mayor of new delhi was killed when he fell from his balcony during an attack by wild monkeys and 25 others were hurt when a monkey rampaged in the city
4881304 the deputy mayor of new delhi was killed when he fell from his balcony during an attack by wild monkeys
4881305 to be conscious that we are perceiving or thinking is to be conscious of our own existence
4881306 there are still certain things to iron out such as soliciting input from industry
4881307 we have come up with several measures to tackle these frequent accidents one of which is strict inspection of small aircraft we need to ensure that these aircraft are indeed fit to fly over the namibian sky
4881308 the month of august would not pass without having released the report with recommendations for appropriate measures
4881309 as we keep emphasising in most of these incidents human error is the leading factor the technical factors are okay
4881310 broad long term agreement on energy matters is a decided plus for a country that has become uncomfortably accustomed to the threat of power shortages the national partys support yesterday of the governments 2007 energy strategy notably the target of 90 per cent renewable electricity generation by 2025 and an emissions trading scheme is therefore welcome this is not an instance where the national party should be criticised for saying me too security of supply is too important for that
4881311 the lesson from this winter is that thermal electricity generation is essential in keeping the lights on
4881312 right now our dry year security margin is higher than its been for most of the 10 years
4881313 then there was the saga of the yishun siblings who had an operation for deep brain stimulation done in taiwan at tremendous cost again paid for by the singapore public
4881314 now they are no longer able to walk not even with assistance
4881315 if you dont get a free lunch you also dont give a free lunch
4881316 but what good is that money to huang na who has died
4881317 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4881318 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4881319 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4881320 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4881321 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4881322 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4881323 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4881324 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4881325 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4881326 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4881327 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4881328 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4881329 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4881330 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4881331 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4881332 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4881333 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4881334 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4881335 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4881336 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4881337 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4881338 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4881339 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4881340 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4881341 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4881342 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4881343 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4881344 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4881345 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4881346 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4881347 who are open to doing something on the production side
4881348 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4881349 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4881350 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4881351 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4881352 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4881353 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4881354 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4881355 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4881356 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4881357 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4881358 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4881359 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4881360 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4881361 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4881362 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4881363 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4881364 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4881365 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4881366 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4881367 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4881368 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4881369 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4881370 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4881371 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4881372 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4881373 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4881374 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4881375 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4881376 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4881377 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4881378 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4881379 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4881380 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4881381 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4881382 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4881383 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4881384 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4881385 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4881386 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4881387 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4881388 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4881389 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4881390 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4881391 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4881392 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4881393 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4881394 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4881395 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4881396 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4881397 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4881398 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4881399 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4881400 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4881401 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4881402 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4881403 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4881404 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4881405 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

4881602 i cant move to san antonio when i dont have any clothes or any money to buy stuff
4881603 i dont have family near here and ive been on my own since i was 17
4881604 everything of mine i ever had was in that apartment
4881605 theres a call for you its reality its time for a check
4881606 shortcutting safety in the name of development is not an option and anyone who puts people at risk will not be tolerated
4881607 for past coaches of the game to get involved in talking about it i think is a disgrace
4881608 it really reflects poorly on them as people to say that draft picks are more important than winning i understand theres people out there that may think that way and it is a massive reflection on them
4881609 our club has never been a willing participant in talking about anything to do with draft picks and we never will be it doesnt hurt me personally but i think it reflects very very badly on those people i think its a shame that there are people out there who would do that
4881610 i would be saying to myself ive got a real chance here to play kids experiment and along the way actually lose and get a crack at a priority pick
4881611 whilst the players will be trying im not so sure the club will be keen
4881612 we were just terrible it was well below whats expected even with a fairly young side it was not acceptable
4881613 they have to look each other in the eye now and thats what ive asked them to do and answer to each other
4881614 it will be interesting to see what they come up with
4881615 theres no question theyre a cut above every team in the competition at the moment by a fair margin
4881616 theyre still three or four players short of their best line up so i think if they play their best theres no one wholl beat them
4881617 i think youve got to put it in perspective because the competition is designed for parity its very very hard for teams over five and six year periods to compete for premierships and i think this group has done an extraordinarily good job
4881618 im sure well play finals footy this year but its tough you look at what happened to brisbane after four grand finals i think they missed the finals the next two or three years and port adelaide have been up an down
4881619 its geelongs time and they deserve it theyre a quality club theyre well coached and theyve got some terrific players
4881620 it just happens to be their time in the cycle wed all love to have the day in the sun every single year but thats not the reality with the salary cap and the draft
4881621 the players are competitive were looking forward to next week we know we played the best team in the competition weve got two games ahead were looking forward to it and well get the players back up again
4881622 thats afl footy its tough and its relentless and you know im certainly looking forward to next week

4881630 sometimes i look out my office windows and i can almost see the ghosts of the workers and buildings that were here for so many years

4881632 by the way it would be really beneficial to this relationship if you gave our latest upcoming artist a little extra airtime this month
4881633 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4881634 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4881635 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4881636 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4881637 so i think the public have got a right to expect that when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well

4881658 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4881659 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4881660 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy

4881665 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4881666 i see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is destroyed
4881667 i know i can still play but its like i told my wife im just tired mentally im just tired

4881797 british law enforcement has the tools to protect children abroad they just dont use them
4881798 sends a strong message to so called sex tourists that they wont get away with targeting other countries with less strict controls than the uk
4881799 from the autumn we also intend to make registered sex offenders notify the police of any travel abroad
4881800 which sets standards to ensure that countries criminalise the sexual exploitation and abuse of children and adopt similar standards of investigation
4881801 we will also take any further action that is necessary and believe these changes that we have made will see the number of sex offenders prosecuted increase

4881818 it was pretty hard to topple the australians this week they were on fire but id have liked to have thought we could have got up for a medal
4881819 i think we suffered a bit from being on that side of the course the race was on the other side and i remember looking around and saying jingos where did they go
4881820 i dont think we went backwards everyone definitely came up to the standard we had in europe and the australians possibly went a little past that
4881821 being in the americas cup final last year was amazing so lets see how that unfolds and catch our breath first and see where life takes us
4881822 id like to think im not completely over the hill yet the guy that got the silver medal today was juri jaanson and he is 42 he is nine years older than me and as long as im still worthwhile out there be it rowing or sailing there is certainly a desire to keep doing sport while i can
4881823 the main reason i didnt do athens 2004 olympics was because of my health and ive been pleasantly surprised ive been able to cope with it
4881824 now ive come through all of this and i feel a lot wiser about it how to manage a lifestyle i thought that would stop me carrying on
4881825 it was quite motivational this morning to watch the twins win their race

4881861 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points

4881899 as a general rule of thumb the more complexity that exists in a wall street cration the faster and farther investors should run
4881900 it does not take much to outperform the average investor all you have to do is put half your money in the vangurd total stock market and the other half in an intermediate term bond fund

4881930 no mom dad i will not make out with you
4881931 en el cap tulo 40 del libro de job encontramos al creador mismo en forma de un torbellino dirigi ndose a job
4881932 he aqu ahora que su fuerza est en sus lomos
4881933 y su vigor en los m sculos de su vientre
4881934 sus huesos son fuertes como bronce y es el principio de los caminos de dios
4881935 tranquilo est aunque todo un jord n se estrelle contra su boca
4881936 to see the fossilized bones of ancient dinosaurs go to a museum to see living descendants of dinosaurs just find some birds
4881937 para ver huesos fosilizados de los antiguos dinosaurios vaya al museo para ver a los descendientes de los dinosaurios simplemente mire alrededor y busque algunos pajaritos
4881938 esto no es m s que una especulaci n basada en una teor a hipot tica haciendo suposiciones pero sin tener evidencia alguna que apoye esta teor a
4881939 la evoluci n no es siquiera una teor a sino una hip tesis lo cual en el m todo cient fico est un paso por debajo para convertirse en una teor a
4881940 la evoluci n el lavado de cerebro m s grande de la historia
4881941 la evolucion no es siquiera una teor a sino una hip tesis lo cual est a un paso por debajo de convertirse en una teor a en el m todo cient fico
4881942 las edades de las capas geol gicas de los evolucionistas est n basadas en una teor a hipot tica la cual est llena de suposiciones que nunca han podido ser probadas
4881943 hay evidencias sustanciales de que estas huellas puede que hayan sido dejadas por humanos que vivieron contempor neamente con los dinosaurios y esto no sucedi hace millones de a os sino hace apenas varios miles de a os en el tiempo del diluvio mundial y otras cat strofes subsecuentes las cuales son responsables del dep sito de las capas terrestres y de las formas en que hoy se encuentra delimitado el planeta
4881944 se han descubierto huellas humanas en los supuestos estratos prehist ricos y muchas otras cosas m s esqueletos de dinosaurios en capas que a los evolucionistas no le conven a que aparecieran artefactos humanos en capas o estratos m s profundos que lo que se supon a f siles que supuestamente eran m s antiguos tal como las trolobitas las cuales debieron haber desaparecido seg n ellos hace millones de a os y sin embargo fueron encontradas en capas m s recientes que las que ellos calculaban
4881945 tengan en cuenta que la tabla de capas o estratos geol gicos de la tierra que ha sido usada por los evolucionistas no es m s que imaginaria
4881946 si es verdad que el diluvio sucedi si es verdad que los dinosaurios convivieron con el hombre al momento del diluvio
4881947 baby dinosaurs grew very quickly and in some cases increased in size some 16 000 times before reaching adulthood

4881952 i would say we have the same chance to do the same thing we need to win three more times
4881953 i wouldnt say we are scared of any team we are not scared of any team we take our chances when it comes
4881954 it was quite unfortunate that the u s side did not qualify
4881955 i feel for him the game of football is tough
4881956 actually my team they asked me a lot about the u s side
4881957 this is my country football is not something you just say but actually what happens on the pitch of play i told them about what i know about the u s side what to expect and about my teammate robbie
4881958 the u s side i would say the last five six minutes they were at the top of the game they were one goal down and they played us to the fullest they are actually a very good side
4881959 they will be more fun and happy this time around because football is getting higher and higher in africa as the boys keep on growing as players

4881962 ill take a nap this afternoon and maybe take an ambien tonight and try to get adjusted as soon as possible
4881963 the main thing is to let him recover a little bit physically and mentally so for the game hell be on the bench and see how the game goes and that will determine his playing time
4881964 he said he feels good but you know how it is the first day you travel back you feel all right it hits you the second or third well let him go at his own pace the next four or five days
4881965 i need to play games because ive been out about three months i need four or five games to feel 100 percent
4881966 im glad were playing a team that had the same amount of time off as we had rather than play team in a different rhythm theyre in the same rhythm and that helps

4882010 for the first time it lays out benchmarks on which he could be judged
4882011 for the first time talk s about a specific date for when he envisions direct american military involvement to be over in iraq
4882012 five long paragraphs interrupted by two follow up questions before we get to yes thats a long time
4882013 just one more piece of the carefully scripted bullshit that presidential candidates hand us as they go about the self interested business of trying to become
4882014 the only thing that held the coalition together was hostility to government
4882015 american policies these days are starting to look a lot like the kind of appeasement that eventually leads to disaster
4882016 capitulationist by action and by default it has been cowardly craven and venal
4882017 sweet triumph for the philologists of appeasement one day we really will be sorry
4882018 they are state sponsors of terrorism of both hezbollah and hamas and they support palestinian terrorism
4882019 people should take a stop back and think about the message it sends and the message it sends to our allies
4882020 apple would gain nothing from telegraphing its intentions and capabilities by releasing public conceptual products the company is being more than prudent by not displaying their unconstrained fantasies to competitors media investors or customers
4882021 sesudah menggunakan lweekang racun dingin dalam tubuhnya mengamuk hebat dan menurut kebiasaan dia bisa menolong diri sendiri dengan mengisap darah manusia
4882022 ketika itu di sampingnya terdapat seorang gadis tapi dia lebih suka mati daripada menghisap darah nona itu melihat itu aku berkata si kelelawar berlaku aneh aku pun mau berlaku aneh baiklah cioe tian coba tolong dia aku lantas saja bekerja dan beginilah hasilnya
4882023 ia mengatakan bahwa nona itu bernama in lee cucu perempuannya si tua bangka peh bie karena sudah menerima si nona sebagai muridnya maka si kelelawar tidak bisa lagi menghisap darahnya
4882024 perbuatan wie heng saudara wie yang mulia itu mungkin akan merupakan titik kebangkitan kembali dari agama kita
4882025 kelelawar hijau dan eng burung eng putih bisa bergandengan tangan kekuatan beng kauw akan bertambah banyak
4882026 dalam sepuluh bagian si kelelawar sudah mati sembilan bagian kalau bangkai kelelawar bergandengan tangan dengan peh bie eng ong bagi beng kauw tak ada kebaikannya sedikitpun juga
4882027 aku akan turun gunung untuk membekuk seorang manusia hidup guna dijadikan minuman bagi wie heng
4882028 tua bangka kau sungguh tak punya otak gunung ini sangat sepi hampir tak ada manusianya kalau mesti menunggu kau wie it siauw wie sekali tertawa sudah menjadi wie poet siauw wie tidak tertawa swee poet tek paling baik kau keluarkan bocah yang berada dalam karungmu untuk menolong saudara wie
4882029 dia telah berbudi sangat besar kepada agama kita jika wie heng membinasakan dia ngo beng kie lima bendera sudah pasti tak mau
4882030 waktu itu aku menyusup di dalam pasukan peh bie kauw dan dengan mataku sendiri aku menyaksikan semuanya
4882031 dengan berhutang budi yang begitu besar ngo beng kie pasti akan membela dia mati matian
4882032 apakah kau ingin menggunakan bocah itu untuk menaklukkan ngo beng kie
4882033 bagaimanapun juga ini kenyataaan bahwa sekarang di dalam beng kauw sudah terjadi keretakan hebat pada saat menghadapi bencana peh bie kauw telah bentrok dengan ngo beng kie untuk menyelamatkan diri dari kemusnahan jalan satu satunya adalah bersatu padu bocah yang berada dalam karungku mempunyai arti penting dalam usaha mendamaikan orang orang kita
4882034 swee poet tek aku tentu tidak bisa mengatakan apapun juga jika kau rela menjual jiwa demi kepentingan seorang sahabat
4882035 cioe tian tiat koan tooheng terima kasih atas pertolongan kalian
4882036 siapa yang terluka apa swee poet tek apa tiat koen heng
4882037 kudengar cian boenjin siauw lim pay kong boen taysoe bersama soeteenya kong tie taysoe dan seratus lebih murid muridnya sedang menerjang ke kong beng teng
4882038 menurut pendapatku kita harus pergi ke kong beng teng secepat mungkin
4882039 bocah yo siauw tidak mengundang kita apakah beng kauw ngo sian jin harus menyembah dia
4882040 jika mereka berhasil menghancurkan kong beng teng dan memadamkan api suci apakah kita masih bisa menjadi manusia memang benar yo siauw telah berbuat tidak pantas terhadap ngo sian jin tapi bantuan kita adalah untuk beng kauw dan bukan untuk kepentingan yo siauw
4882041 biarpun yo siauw sangat kurang ajar kita harus ingat kepentingan agama kita yang lebih besar daripada kepentingan pribadi
4882042 dua keledai gundul sama sama omong kosong tiat koan toojin yo siauw pernah menghancurkan pundak kirimu apa kau masih ingat
4882043 melindungi agama kita dan memundurkan musuh adalah hal yang sangat penting perhitungan dengan yo siauw dapat dibereskan sesudah musuh dipukul mundur dengan ngo sian jin bersatu padu tak usah kuatir bocah itu tidak tunduk
4882044 dahulu kita pernah bersumpah bahwa ngo sian jin tak akan memperdulikan lagi urusan beng kauw apakah sumpah itu hanya omong kosong
4882045 dahulu kita bermusuhan karena tak mendapat kecocokan dalam urusan memilih kauwcoe memang benar yo siauw berpandangan sempit tapi bila dipikir pikir ngo sian jin pun ada salahnya
4882046 biarpun kita bertengkar setahun kita tak dapat membereskan soal siapa salah siapa benar
4882047 cioe tian kau jawablah pertanyaanku apakah kau bukan murid beng coen thian seng
4882048 pada saat ini agama kita tengah menghadapi bencana dan bila kita terus berpangku tangan apakah dalam baka kita ada muka untuk bertemu dengan beng coen thian seng
4882049 jika kau takut biarlah kami berempat yang pergi ke kong beng teng setelah kami binasa kau boleh mengubur mayatku
4882050 tenagaku hanya digunakan terhadap musuh dan takkan dipakai terhadap orang sendiri
4882051 aku suruh dia membalas dia tidak mau tak bisa lain aku harus turun tangan sendiri
4882052 kami berempat sudah mengambil keputusan untuk mengorbankan jiwa di atas kong beng teng kita akan berpisah untuk selama lamanya apa ada masalah jika memukul aku sekali dua kali
4882053 akupun akan ikut biarlah perhitungan dengan yo siauw dibereskan belakangan
4882054 mereka berlima bukan saja berkepandaian tinggi tapi juga mempunyai budi pekerti yang sangat luhur apakah orang orang seperti itu sesat semua
4882055 yo siauw si kelelawar dan ngo sian jin datang untuk menemuimu
4882056 aku sungguh tak menyangka hok ong dan ngo sian jin sudi datang berkunjung yo siauw tak bisa menyambut dari tempat jauh dan harap kalian sudi memaafkan
4882057 di dalam hati kau tentu mencaci kami kau tentu mencaci kami sebagai badut yang sudah bersumpah tak mau naik lagi ke kong beng teng dan tak mau ikut campur lagi urusan beng kauw sekarang datang tanpa diundang
4882058 siauw tee justru sedang kebingungan enam partai besar telah mengurung kong beng teng dan siauw tee seorang diri dengan memandang muka coen thian seng hok ong dan ngo sian jin datang berkunjung untuk memberi bantuan ini benar benar rejekinya beng kauw
4882059 co soe cia kau telah membinasakan pelayanmu aku pasti akan membalas budimu itu
4882060 bahwa hok ong sudi datang ke sini merupakan bukti bahwa ia menghargai aku
4882061 cie san liong ong dan kim mo say ong tak ketahuan ke mana perginya sedang mati hidupnya kong beng yoe soe juga belum dapat dipastikan mereka bertiga tak usah dimasukkan ke dalam perhitungan di pihak kita bentrokan antara ngo beng kie dan peh bie kauw yang makin lama makin hebat dan kedua belah pihak menderita kerusakan besar andaikata mereka bisa berdamai dan bisa datang ke sini jangankan hanya enam dua belas atau delapan belas partaipun pasti akan dapat dipukul mundur
4882062 bocah ini berada di dalam peh bie kauw dan iapun telah berbudi besar kepada ngo beng kie mungkin sekali di kemudian hari ia akan memainkan peranan penting dalam usaha mendamaikan permusuhan di antara kita
4882063 sebelum kauwcoe dipilih perselisihan dalam kalangan agama kita pasti tak akan bisa dibereskan
4882064 manusia yang paling tinggi kepandaiannya tak akan berhasil mendamaikan kita co soe cia aku yang rendah ingin mengajukan sebuah pertanyaan kepadamu sesudah musuh dipukul mundur siapakah yang akan didukung olehmu untuk menjadi kauwcoe
4882065 siapa yang bisa mendapatkan seng hwee leng dialah yang jadi kauwcoe
4882066 ini adalah peraturan agama kita perlu apa kau bertanya lagi
4882067 apakah sebegitu lama seng hwee leng tidak muncul sebegitu lama juga beng kauw tidak mempunyai kauwcoe bahwa enam partai persilatan sudah berani menyerang adalah karena mereka tahu terjadinya perpecahan di dalam beng kauw
4882068 po tay hweeshio tidak miring ke manapun juga aku bukan orang partai in juga bukan dari partai wie siapapun juga menjadi kauwcoe disetujui olehku yang penting kita harus mempunyai kauwcoe andaikata belum ada kauwcoe untuk sementara waktu boleh juga diangkat seorang wakil kauwcoe kalau tak ada orang yang memegang tampuk pimpinan bagaimana kita bisa melawan musuh secara teratur
4882069 apa kau rasa aku tak tahu maksudmu mengapa kau tetap tak mau memilih seorang kauw coe sebegitu lama beng kauw belum punya kauwcoe begitu juga kau sebagai kong beng co soe yang mempunyai kedudukan paling tinggi huh huh bukankah benar begitu tapi meskipun kau menduduki kursi tertinggi tak seorangpun mau mendengar segala perintahmu apa gunanya apa kau bisa memerintah ngo beng kie apa kau mampu menyuruh keempat hoe kauw hoat ong kami kelima ngo sian jin hidup bagaikan awan bebas dan burung ho liar bagi kami kong beng co soe tidak berarti apapun
4882070 dalam menghadapi musuh dari luar yo siauw tidak mempunyai waktu bersilat lidah dengan kalian
4882071 apabila kalian rela mengawasi hidup matinya beng kauw dan berpangku tangan silakan kalian turun dari kong beng teng kalau yo siauw masih bernafas di kemudian hari ia akan melayani kalian satu demi satu
4882072 serangan enam partai kepada beng kauw mengenai setiap murid dari agama kita urusan ini bukan urusan kau seorang
4882073 tapi mungkin dalam agama kita ada orang orang yang mengharapkan matinya aku
4882074 kata orang saudara berkelahi yang lain tertawa meski kita cekcok dan berkelahi seperti langit roboh dan bumi terbalik kita tetap merupakan saudara sendiri menurut pendapatku sementara waktu kita tunda saja soal pemilihan kauwcoe sekarang ini kita harus merundingkan siasat untuk melawan musuh
4882075 kepala gundul she pheng tahu urusan cioe tian tidak tahu urusan
4882076 kauwcoe kita harus dipilih hari ini juga aku mengusulkan wie it siauw si kelelawar berkepandaian tinggi dan banyak tipu dayanya dalam beng kauw siapa yang bisa menandingi dia
4882077 menurut pendapatku paling baik kita angkat cioe tian sebagai kauwcoe
4882078 sekarang beng kauw sudah berantakan dan kalau dijungkir balikkan oleh kauwcoe besar cioe tian agama kita akan lebih sedap dipandangnya
4882079 yo co soe wie hok ong berhentilah kalian tidak boleh berkelahi dengan kawan sendiri
4882080 cioe tian di antara saudara sendiri perlu apa mengadu jiwa
4882081 meskipun berkepandaian tinggi kepandaian yo siauw hanya kira kira sebanding dengan kepandaian wie it siauw
4882082 sepantasnya wie it siauw dan empat kawanku pasti akan dapat merobohkannya tapi mengapa dia yang lebih unggul
4882083 lima pit ini akan menghantam kim tie kie koet yang kee ngo lie dan tiong touw hiatmu
4882084 sesudah aku menghitung satu dua tiga kalian tarik pulang tenaga dengan berbarengan supaya tak sampai terluka
4882085 thia siapa yang datang mengapa kau tak memperkenalkan mereka kepadaku
4882086 matamu sangat tajam kau bisa mengenali bahwa aku seorang hweeshio hm aku tak bisa mengampuni kau lagi
4882087 belum tentu dia bisa hidup tiga hari tiga malam lagi
4882088 nama besar dari kong beng soecia memang bukan nama kosong sudah kena dua totokan kau masih bisa berdiri
4882089 kong kian taysoe pendeta suci dari siauw lim adalah seorang yang welas asih dan mulia hatinya
4882090 sungguh tak disangka ia mempunyai seorang murid yang terkutuk seperti kau kau tentulah seorang murid dari deretan goan goan apa namamu
4882091 matamu benar hebat kau sudah bisa melihat asal usulku pinceng bernama goan tin
4882092 orang itu telah menghajar siauw lim kioe yang kang kepadaku
4882093 dia tahu bahwa dalam tubuhku mengeram racun hian beng sin ciang tapi dia sengaja membuka pembuluh darahku sehingga racun dingin itu sukar diusir dari dalam badanku dilihat begini dia bukan saja berilmu tinggi tapi juga sangat jahat dalam enam partai persilatan mungkin sekali dia yang paling hebat hm kali ini beng kauw harus menerima nasib
4882094 dalam permusuhan antara enam partai dan beng kauw sebagai laki laki sejati kita harus bertempur dengan senjata secara berhadap hadapan tapi kau
4882095 semenjak jaman purba di dalam peperangan orang menarik keuntungan dengan siasat luar biasa dan dalam memimpin tentara orang memang biasa menggunakan tipu daya
4882096 aku goan tin seorang sudah bisa merobohkan tujuh jago utama dari beng kauw apakah kamu masih penasaran
4882097 bagaimana kau bisa mengenal jalan jalan rahasia di gunung ini jika kau mau memberitahukan biarpun mati yo siauw akan mati dengan mata meram
4882098 orang orang mo kauw menganggap bahwa kong beng teng yang mempunyai tujuh puncak dan tiga belas tebing sebagai tempat yang tak akan bisa dilewati manusia
4882099 di dalam beng kauw terdapat banyak sekali orang pandai jika kalian tidak saling bunuh tidak saling makan beng kauw takkan menghadapi bencana seperti hari ini lihatlah kejadian yang sekarang karena kalian bertujuh berkelahi maka dengan mudah pinceng bisa naik sampai di sini kalau bukan lantaran begitu mana bisa pinceng berhasil dengan begitu gampang ha ha ha tak disangka beng kauw yang dulu begitu hebat sesudah matinya yo po thian lantas menjadi runtuh
4882100 aku benar benar pantas mati aku telah melakukan banyak perbuatan tidak pantas terhadapmu walaupun kau tidak terlalu baik tapi kalau kau menjadi kauwcoe keadaan kita akan lebih baik daripada tidak punya kauwcoe sama sekali
4882101 dalam urusan ini kita semua bersalah kita salah membuat keadaan menjadi sedemikian kacau dan agama kita akhirnya akan musnah sehingga di alam baka kita takkan punya muka untuk menemui para beng coen kauwcoe
4882102 pada waktu yo po thian mengepalai mo kauw keangkerannya meluap luap hanya sayang dia mati terlalu cepat sehingga ia tak bisa menyaksikan kehancuran mo kauw
4882103 tutup mulutmu jika yo kauwcoe masih hidup kami semua akan menaati segala perintahnya kepala gundul macam kau mana bisa membokong kami
4882104 tak perduli yo po thian mati atau hidup aku tetap mempunyai cara untuk menghancurkan mo kauw
4882105 mulut karung dijerat mati dan kecuali olehku sendiri siapapun juga tak akan bisa membukanya
4882106 tanpa memperdulikan keselamatan jiwa kau sudah menolong beberapa puluh saudara dari swie kim kie kesatriaanmu dikagumi oleh semua orang sekarang kamipun mengandalkan bantuanmu pergilah ke tempat pendeta bangsat itu dan hantam dia sampai mati
4882107 cara bangsat itu telah didengar oleh kau sendiri kalau kau tidak membinasakan ia maka berlaksa laksa anggota beng kauw akan musnah dalam tangannya jika membunuh dia kau melakukan perbuatan yang sangat mulia
4882108 apabila kau mengambil nyawaku dalam keadaan begitu kau akan ditertawai oleh seluruh orang gagah di kolong langit
4882109 siauw lim pay menyebut diri sebagai partai yang lurus bersih tapi kau diam diam telah membokong orang apakah perbuatan itu semua tak ditertawai semua orang gagah di kolong langit
4882110 aku sama sekali tak tahu sebab dari permusuhan agamamu dengan enam partai persilatan aku sangat ingin membantu kalian tetapi akupun tak mau mencelakai pendeta siauw lim pay itu
4882111 saudara kecil ada satu hal belum dipikirkan kami tapi akan mengambil nyawamu juga
4882112 di samping itu iapun bukan anggota mo kauw tak bisa salah lagi ia ditangkap po tay hweeshio dengan maksud jahat memang orang orang mo kauw memang biasa berlaku kejam dan melakukan perbuatan perbuatan terkutuk
4882113 swee poet tek taysoe cobalah kau mencari suatu cara supaya aku tak usah membinasakannya dan ia pun tak bisa mencelakai kalian
4882114 saudara kecil kau seorang yang sangat mulia dan kami semua merasa sangat kagum sekarang begini saja tolong kau totok giok tong hiat di dada goan tin totokan ini takkan membahayakan dirinya ia hanya tak bisa mengerahkan lweekang untuk beberapa jam aku akan memerintahkan orang untuk mengantarnya turun dari kong beng teng dan kami berjanji bahwa kami takkan mengganggu selembar rambutnya
4882115 totokan pada giok tong hiat memang tak membahayakan jiwaku tapi begitu tenaga mereka pulih mereka pasti akan membinasakan aku bagaimana kau bisa cegah mereka
4882116 kami sudah berjanji untuk tak mencelakai kau apakah perkataan ngo sian jin dari beng kauw tidak dapat dipercaya
4882117 tapi kalau bertemu di lain kali kami pasti akan mengadu jiwa dengannya
4882118 kong beng soecia ceng ek hok ong dan ngo sian jin adalah orang orang gagah pada jaman ini dan mereka tentu tak akan menjilat lagi ludah yang sudah dibuang goan tin taysoe maafkan boanpwee terpaksa berbuat begini terhadapmu
4882119 untuk kebaikan kedua belah pihak boanpwee terpaksa harus bertindak begini mohon taysoe tidak menjadi gusar
4882120 theres a number of things that an effective closer has to do
4882121 if i made a list it would probably be about half a dozen if you want to be a high percentage effective closer against all hitters in all situations right now you cant give him a check mark in all six categories but he has a real possibility of filling in the blanks
4882122 he would not do it verbally we gave them a number from day 1
4882123 the only thing we were told on the day of the draft was that they wanted a major league contract and an out of the box deal
4882124 the only relevant thing at this point is that bowden and the nationals had an opportunity to sign aaron for halfway between what yonder alonso and justin smoak signed for late friday night and they declined to do so
4882125 the minute matusz signed with baltimore i called randy hendricks and said brian matusz the fourth player taken in the country just signed with baltimore
4882126 he responded via e mail we have no interest in the matusz deal and we have no interest in a deal below matusz
4882127 we offered crow more than any other pitcher got in this draft thats how we value the player we never offered a major league contract to a first round pick we offered a major league contract to this player thats how we value the player
4882128 the major league contract was on the table up until the time we could no longer do an mri
4882129 when it got to the point where we couldnt do an mri we explained to them we could no longer do a major league contract in fact their final offer to us was a minor league contract as well
4882130 look im tired my advisers randy and alan hendricks are handling the negotiations they are making the decisions
4882131 we lost one really good player but 10 months from now we can get the exact same caliber player
4882132 we know there is a lot of pitching in next years draft we feel confident that our no 9a pick next year will be a talent similar to crow
4882133 when he slid into second friday night he got hit so hes sore and hes not in the lineup

4882135 i think the key words in the rulebook are impair impede intent i didnt see any of those three he just went straight in i think he did ok
4882136 i think i probably knew what i was trying to do or wanted to do the last year or so but sometimes i think now im a little better about executing
4882137 its a better thought process and thats part of maturity
4882138 i dont think we live in a communist country we will do what is commercially appropriate what is prudent
4882139 therefore i dont know of any legislation that says that the reserve bank actually sets interest rates for commercial operations in this country
4882140 the public have a right to expect when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4882141 were in a situation where the reserve bank increases obviously had an impact on the 90 day bill rate and there has been a significant margin built up over that bill rate over the last 12 months and then when you look at the offshore funding costs particularly on the longer dated funding it was a significant increase of up over 100 basis points
4882142 so we ended up in a situation where we under recovered about 16 basis points on average on mortgages
4882143 could you spare me a drop just a drop of your eternal grace
4882144 well make a winning team wont we cause when i fall down youll become a pretty flower and ill be finally free from the shackles of this cloud and the sun will shine and well make the most of life come we havent got much time cause all living things must die but i will nurture you til your petals turn to white and you will hold me close until the last drop of me dries

4882160 the increases in attacks while dangerous are a sign that we are finding the enemy and denying them safe haven which is the objective of operation iron pursuit
4882161 the enemy is showing themselves to be heartless with the destruction of citizens homes and we will continue to deny them sanctuary anywhere in northern iraq
4882162 were being pretty tight lipped about the entire operation because we dont really know what to expect
4882163 they would have you believe theyre clubs but theyre not theyre involved in criminal enterprise

4882175 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4882176 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4882177 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4882178 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4882179 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4882180 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4882181 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4882182 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4882183 why dont you get your tight ass over here right now and find out
4882184 of course dont be ridiculous come right in make your self at home
4882185 what about your neighbors arent you afraid of what they will think
4882186 unless anyone has experienced chronic pain they couldnt begin to understand the true meaning of pain relief
4882187 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4882188 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4882189 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4882190 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4882191 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4882192 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4882193 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4882194 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4882195 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4882196 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4882197 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4882198 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4882199 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4882200 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4882201 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4882202 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4882203 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4882204 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4882205 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4882206 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4882207 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4882208 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4882209 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4882210 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4882211 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4882212 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4882213 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4882214 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4882215 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4882216 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4882217 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4882218 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4882219 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4882220 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4882221 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4882222 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4882223 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4882224 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4882225 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4882226 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4882227 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4882228 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4882229 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4882230 this is a planning took where all things are going
4882231 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4882232 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4882233 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4882234 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4882235 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4882236 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4882237 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4882238 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4882239 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4882240 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4882241 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4882242 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4882243 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4882244 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4882245 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4882246 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4882247 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4882248 unless anyone has experienced chronic pain they couldnt begin to understand the true meaning of pain relief
4882249 will you look at the people going to that booth
4882250 oh thats alpha stim i have one of those i had decades of insomnia i got an alpha stim unit and i sleep like a baby now if i wake up in the night i just plug myself back in and go right back to sleep
4882251 will you look at the people going to that booth
4882252 oh thats alpha stim i have one of those i had decades of insomnia i got an alpha stim unit and i sleep like a baby now if i wake up in the night i just plug myself back in and go right back to sleep
4882253 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4882254 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4882255 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4882256 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4882257 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4882258 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4882259 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4882260 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4882261 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4882262 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4882263 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4882264 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4882265 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4882266 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4882267 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4882268 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4882269 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4882270 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4882271 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4882272 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4882273 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4882274 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4882275 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4882276 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4882277 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4882278 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4882279 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4882280 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty

4882284 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4882285 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4882286 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4882287 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4882288 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4882289 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep

4882292 these rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels
4882293 these rules apply to all vessels upon the inland waters of the united states and to vessels of the united states on the canadian waters of the great lakes to the extent that there is no conflict with canadian law
4882294 cant i just enjoy one moment in nature without that thing in my face
4882295 a every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists if there is any doubt such risk shall be deemed to exist
4882296 c assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information especially scanty radar information
4882297 d in determining if risk of collision exists the following considerations shall be among those taken into account i such risk shall be deemed to exist if the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not appreciably change and ii such risk may sometimes exist even when an appreciable bearing change is evident particularly when approaching a very large vessel or a tow or when approaching a vessel at close range
4882298 every vessel shall at all times proceed at a safe speed so that she can take proper and effective action to avoid collision and be stopped within a distance appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions
4882299 every description of water craft including nondisplacement craft and seaplanes used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water
4882300 in determining a safe speed the following factors shall be among those taken in account i the state of visibility ii the traffic density including concentration of fishing vessels or any other vessels iii the maneuverability of the vessel with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability in the prevailing conditions iv at night the presence of background light such as from shore lights or from back scatter of her own lights v the state of wind sea and current and the proximity of navigational hazards vi the draft in relation to the available depth of water

4882303 self if they are going to be camping for a month they better get use to bugs
4882304 a nothing in these rules shall exonerate any vessel or the owner master or crew thereof from the consequences of any neglect to comply with these rules or of the neglect of any precaution which may be required by the ordinary practice of seamen or by the special circumstances of the case
4882305 b in construing and complying with these rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances including the limitations of the vessels involved which may make a departure from these rules necessary to avoid immediate danger
4882306 in effect rule 2 enjoins all to know and use the rules but warns against too rigid an interpretation
4882307 for the purpose of these rules and this chapter except where the context otherwise requires
4882308 that a vessel is not at anchor or made fast to the shore or aground
4882309 a seaplane on the water shall in general keep well clear of all vessels and avoid impeding their navigation in circumstances however where risk of collision exists she shall comply withthe rules of this part steering and sailing rules rule 18
4882310 its not my fault i had the right of way
4882311 every vessel shall at all times maintain a proper look out by sight and hearing as well as by all available means appropriate in the prevailing circumstances and conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision
4882312 a person who is specially charged with the duty of observing the lights sounds echoes or any obstruction to navigation with the thoroughness that the circumstances permit the words specially charged imply that such person shall have no other duties that detract in any way from the keeping of a proper look out
4882313 clearly then the duties of the look out and helmsman are separate and the helmsman should not be considered the person on look out while steering other than in the smallest of vessels where an all around view is provided at the steering position whoever is keeping a look out must be able to give full attention to that task and no duties should be assigned or undertaken that would interfere with keeping a proper look out
4882314 these rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels
4882315 these rules apply to all vessels upon the inland waters of the united states and to vessels of the united states on the canadian waters of the great lakes to the extent that there is no conflict with canadian law
4882316 hello world you are witnessing the attempt of a 65 year old man whoo has never really understood
4882317 hey come over to my house and well watch that movie you like
4882318 i cant explain it when the chips are down these guys somehow figure out a way to come together and get it done
4882319 i think the two best public schools in the state played tonight
4882320 there were a couple times in the game where i was scared
4882321 the last 10 seconds were crazy i think the last shot i got lucky it was a deflection that hit me in the chest
4882322 you saw the two no 1 seeds go toe to toe and they got one bounce
4882323 we were hammering on the doorstep but it just wouldnt drop for us i thought a couple of times we had it at the end but it just wouldnt go in puck luck just wasnt on our side tonight
4882324 senator obama has consistently said i would force people to have health care whether they can afford it or not
4882325 would leave 15 million people out i dispute that i think it is inaccurate
4882326 i take senator clinton at her word that she knew nothing about the photo
4882327 in the last several debates i seem to get the first question all the time i dont mind ill be happy to field it i just find it curious if anybody saw saturday night live maybe we should ask barack if hes comfortable and needs another pillow
4882328 the charges that senator obamas campaign has made regarding fliers and mailers and other information that he has been putting out about my health care plan and my position on nafta have been very disturbing to me
4882329 constantly sent out negative attacks on us we havent whined about it because i understand thats the nature of these campaigns
4882330 i will say to mexico that we will opt out of nafta unless we renegotiate it
4882331 that conversation i had with the farm bureau i was not ambivalent at all
4882332 i think things have gotten a little hotter in the last couple of days
4882333 it is not an injury we feel he can play with
4882334 ive made the recommendation that it be treated surgically and we are working with him to get other opinions just to be certain that that is indeed what should be done
4882335 if i cannot play in the olympics for my country this time it will be the biggest loss in my career to right now
4882336 i dont want to try actually and i dont want to know either
4882337 when coach tells everybody i am out for the season everybody is like quiet
4882338 that kind of quietness makes me feel kind of scared it was quiet like nobody was there and you just feel alone
4882339 weve been playing exceptional ball and yaos been a huge part of that
4882340 we feel very confident about our playoff push weve managed to step up and play well without yao in the past and coaches and players feel confident that were going to continue to play well and make the playoffs this year
4882341 for a freshman she has a lot of court savvy shes unselfish she doesnt take bad shots
4882342 we got more in the second half now its all about survive and advance
4882343 we beat them both times in the nbil but people said three would be tough its good to go on to the next round
4882344 we go out and do what we know how to do
4882345 our keys were box out and contain other than bastinck we did a good job
4882346 were young but were learning weve really come together as a team
4882347 we had some new girls and some old girls but as the seasons gone on weve become more of a team weve worked better together
4882348 if we keep doing what were doing weve got a chance
4882349 we did a lot of chasing for the last 40 minutes of the game tonight
4882350 we didnt have the puck enough we didnt play the puck control game like we need to
4882351 the bottom line is how can you make your team better and at what expense
4882352 that is the best we could do we like our team we like our chemistry
4882353 were right at the top of the eastern conference so i think the guys in here have earned the right to go for it
4882354 when we get bryce in here that will solidify some things some more on the back end
4882355 greene let his guy go and was too soft on him
4882356 he was too soft on the first goal too around the net hey we have nine defensemen here when you play like that its tough to stay in the lineup
4882357 our main focus will be on quality and were going to give a lot of bands that dont have a chance to be heard on the radio that opportunity
4882358 we want to be playing everything from indie rock to hip hop to classic rock to soul to dance rock
4882359 i was obviously super nervous about working for clear channel if it wasnt for evan i probably wouldnt be doing this
4882360 but i always loved the idea of working with the system to do something cool rather than just complaining about the system all the time even though we work with clear channel were not them were geared to give artists a chance to be heard whether it be talking about music or playing live concerts or broadcasting multiple tracks off a record its not just playing one single

4882368 jogadores t m que ter a certeza de que eu fiquei satisfeito porque o time n o se intimidou mostrou qualidade
4882369 perder faz parte do jogo ali no vesti rio eu vi que os jogadores t m a tristeza da derrota mas eles tamb m t m que ter a certeza de que eu fiquei satisfeito porque o time n o se intimidou mostrou qualidade e a que temos que analisar com os jogadores o que precisamos melhorar
4882370 o diogo um grande jogador mas ele est resolvendo a situa o dele mas n s temos que saber jogar sem ele tamb m e hoje o time se portou muito bem infelizmente tomamos o gol no final mas em compensa o nos portamos bem enquanto nos outros jogos estivemos mal
4882371 isso foi o que eu disse a eles no vesti rio eu vi que voc s podem voc s n o amarelaram fora de casa voc s t m condi es de manter o mesmo aproveitamento fora e sair para somar pontos
4882372 isso que tem servir de insentivo de confian a para o pr ximo jogo fora do canind temos que sair para jogar mesmo e conquistar pontos
4882373 disposi o em brigar at o apito final o ponto de partida de tudo
4882374 sensa o que te deixa esse tipo de vit ria
4882375 marcou faltas de um lado e n o do outro e os cinco minutos de desconto foram excessivos
4882376 s houve uma oferta fixada definitivamente e chegou da it lia
4882377 eles correram porque quiseram e jamais deram chance para o advers rio o m rito todo dos jogadores
4882378 eu dei sorte que o time se superou eu e o moraci santanna preparador f sico tivemos pouco tempo em termos de trabalho mas esse grupo vai crescer muito e gostei de lidar com eles um pessoal limpo um pessoal do bem um exemplo de grupo de jogadores de futebol
4882379 eles correram porque quiseram e jamais deram chance para o advers rio o m rito todo dos jogadores e meu discurso sempre vai ser esse depois de uma vit ria tentei passar para os jogadores mas muita coisa que eles fizeram foi improvisa o deles
4882380 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4882381 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4882382 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4882383 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4882384 so i think the public have got a right to expect that when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4882385 lets call animal control and get rid of those before we put up the for rent sign
4882386 they have cute little brown ducks over there that should help with the mosquito problem
4882387 honey that crazy ladys trying to communicate again dont make eye contact
4882388 you kidding you were in an exam room in 45 minutes and you werent any kind of trauma patient thats amazingly fast
4882389 okay this must be wrong because youre alert and talking to me
4882390 get rid of that thing before i get home because i dont want to deal with a perhaps fatally injured kitten after a tiring extra stressful day at the hospital
4882391 you know we really havent gotten all that committed to the remodel we could just slap a coat of paint on it and a for sale by owner sign in the yard
4882392 no if you eat all the blossoms off the tomato plants there wont be any more treats

4882395 el asesinato de una mujer en el marco de relaciones desiguales de poder entre hombres y mujeres
4882396 las ong en guatemala han reaccionado de manera mezclada nuestra reflexi n interna a n no ha terminado cuenta a las12 sebasti n elgueta investigador del equipo centroam rica de amnist a internacional autor del informe ni protecci n ni justicia homicidio de mujeres la ley tiene aspectos positivos y es que pone el t rmino violencia de g nero y le eleva el perfil incluye apoyo integral para sobrevivientes asistencia legal para v ctimas y el compromiso de proveer financiamiento para estas iniciativas pero en t rminos del procedimiento penal la ley anterior era bastante comprensible para asegurar la persecuci n de los responsables de asesinar mujeres nosotros identificamos que casi nadie era llevado delante de la justicia no por falta de un marco legal adecuado sino por una falta de iniciativa por parte de polic as pero m s que todo de fiscales que son quienes investigan estos cr menes y tambi n por una actitud de discriminaci n hacia las instituciones estatales que tienen que ver la ley es una se al positiva pero no es la rectificaci n de esas limitaciones institucionales
4882397 uno de los indicadores de extrema violencia cuyo fin no s lo es causar la muerte sino hacer sufrir a la persona antes de morir
4882398 la mayor a de los cr menes ocurren entre las 6 de la tarde y las 11 de la noche cuando el hombre suele estar en la casa
4882399 1612 casos son consecuencia del consumo de alcohol en 155 son celos y en 26 drogas
4882400 la mayor a de los casos de muerte violenta de mujeres no son investigados en los que s la investigaci n no se realiza de manera eficiente las autoridades no manejan eficientemente la escena del crimen en muchos casos se justifica el no investigar con la estigmatizaci n de las v ctimas culpando a las mujeres por lo sucedido desacredit ndolas especulando su participaci n en una mara pandilla juvenil por tener alg n tatuaje en el cuerpo o calific ndolas de sexo servidoras si llevan las u as pintadas y minifalda
4882401 en guatemala sintieron que estaba hablando mal de su pa s
4882402 llegu al cuerpo de bomberos recuerda ellos tienen un departamento de prensa que se encarga de avisar a los medios cuando aparece alg n cuerpo u ocurri alg n accidente pero claro los bomberos avisaban a los que consideraban m s de su palo as que para tener mejor v nculo con ellos el primer tiempo me quedaba con ellos hablando com amos juntos me qued a dormir ah hasta que me dijeron andate que te avisamos sintieron que no estaba jugando sino que de verdad estaba haciendo un trabajo serio
4882403 el movimiento de mujeres hace un enorme esfuerzo trabaja en condiciones arriesgadas arriesg ndose a que las maten asegura el investigador de amnesty el esfuerzo de las organizaciones locales ha logrado que se incremente el n mero de fiscales dedicados a la investigaci n ha puesto de relieve el tema y hecho que se lo tome en serio
4882404 estos son los primeros pasos a dar antes de esperar resultados concretos
4882405 el turista normal nunca se ve involucrado en cr menes que hacen noticia debido a que los m viles de estos cr menes no suelen ser m s que un robo o atraco
4882406 escaso empe o demostrado en realizar investigaciones a fondo la ausencia de medidas para la protecci n de los testigos las v ctimas y sus familiares y la falta de informaci n y de datos sobre los casos las causas de la violencia y el perfil de las v ctimas
4882407 es duro ver que el violador o el asesino de tu hija est libre y que presentar una denuncia no sirve para nada es incluso peor acusar a los autores es peligroso porque muchas veces te amenazan a ti
4882408 la ocupaci n de la v ctima es un dato que contribuye a dignificar su muerte ya que se comunica cu les fueron sus aportes a la vida social pol tica y cultural de su pa s
4882409 las declaraciones de las personas cercanas a las mujeres asesinadas son claves para reivindicar su vida en raras oportunidades se les da espacio a las familias para reclamar justicia o para que den a conocer el trato que las autoridades le dan a la investigaci n
4882410 abordar el contexto social y pol tico en el que se presentan los casos contribuir a a que la poblaci n tome conciencia de la situaci n que se vive en el pa s la prensa no pone de manifiesto el c rculo vicioso de la violencia de g nero y c mo afect el entorno de la afectada tampoco muestra objetivamente el perfil que retrate la conducta de los victimarios
4882411 los medios monitoreados est n faltando a compromisos asumidos por el estado guatemalteco en el mbito internacional en materia de derechos humanos derechos de las mujeres y promoci n de nuevas formas de comunicaci n y de informaci n esta tendencia informativa genera percepciones exacerbadas sobre la violencia afecta la participaci n social de las guatemaltecas e inhibe su desarrollo

4882416 it was the right thing to do to give the president the authority to confront saddam hussein i think saddam hussein was a very serious threat i stand by that and thats why john kerry and i stand behind our vote on the resolution
4882417 it is unrealistic to think that we can deport more than 12 million people edwards believes we need to give people here the opportunity to pay a fine and learn english to earn american citizenship
4882418 we have a tax code thats hopelessly out of date and out of step for our times now punishes the things that we say that we want more of and makes us less competitive in the world
4882419 taxes are also a burden on production because they discourage people from investing amp taking risks some economists have calculated that today each additional 1 collected by the government by raising income tax rates makes the private sector as much as 2 worse off to me this means one simple thing tax rates should be as low as possible
4882420 clearly we didnt go in with enough troops and we didnt know what to expect when we got there but now were showing signs of progress i think we got to take advantage of the opportunities that we have there to turn around and us to stabilize that place and not to have to leave with our tail between our legs if we did that it would make for a more dangerous usa
4882421 youre going to have to in some way work out a deal where they can have some aspirations of citizenship but not make it so easy that its unfair to the people waiting in line and abiding by the law

4882425 houdt er zeer ernstig rekening mee dat de beleving van deze beelden voor gelovige moslims zo hevig kan zijn dat dit kan leiden tot gewelddadige reacties
4882426 zij absoluut niet zou willen dat iets dergelijks de heer wilders of zijn omgeving zou overkomen

4882439 there is pressure on the hospital but we are managing the best we can
4882440 but were very aware that the polls move around and historically once the campaign proper starts the major parties often drop and the smaller parties lift
4882441 so we have to be mindful of that and work very hard to the final hour its going to be a fight
4882442 the caucus is in the top 50 everyone is fine in the current environment theyre pretty happy
4882443 we need to reach out we talk to ethnic communities weve been working with them and we want them involved in the national party
4882444 i see a huge change in the national party theres a generational change happening and a diversity change
4882445 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4882446 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4882447 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4882448 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4882449 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4882450 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4882451 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4882452 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew whatever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me
4882453 i had a difficult youth i experimented with drugs and drank i trace this to a certain selfishness on my point i couldnt focus on other people
4882454 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of the constitution
4882455 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
4882456 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
4882457 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
4882458 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
4882459 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4882460 he is clearly burning that many calories if he wasnt he would look chubby
4882461 its interesting if he wasnt eating that many calories he wouldnt be winning because he wouldnt have the energy
4882462 the carbs is what the body uses for energy you have to give the body glucose to fuel it thats why people on the atkins diet an all protein diet cant work out
4882463 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4882464 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4882465 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4882466 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4882467 shall be commander in chief of the defense forces of zimbabwe

4882470 we were not looking for bigfoot we wouldnt know what we were doing if we did
4882471 i didnt believe in bigfoot at the time but youve got to come to terms with it and realize youve got something special and thats what it was
4882472 it seems that the stalkers have busted us in a hoax
4882473 we still have a corpse we just wanted to give you something to do for the weekend
4882474 ill tell you what ive seen and what ive touched and what ive felt what ive prodded was not a mask sewed onto a bear hide ok
4882475 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4882476 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4882477 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4882478 early case identification and treatment with oseltamivir is key to addressing the high case fatality rate in indonesian cases there is a clear need to identify definite causes for high case fatality while additional research is done we propose the following strategies to provide early diagnosis and prompt treatment to improve quality of case management poultry surveillance is being stepped up and active human case finding by local health centres and village officials is being instituted in areas of poultry deaths
4882479 consideration needs to be given now not in the teeth of a pandemic and not deflected by either proprietary defensiveness or opportunistic profiteering to gauging the comprehensiveness of national surveillance for human h5n1 cases and to ensuring the analysability of a minimum dataset on the exposures and clinical course of every confirmed case of human h5n1 the world also needs to find a more equitable way to ensure that all share in the benefits of such important research indonesia could give the lead here
4882480 ive dedicated so much to my parents but tonight it was all about val and all about coach kirsten hellier and just the hard work weve put in over the last 10 years
4882481 its been a long road but an awesome road and just a great journey to be riding its fantastic i couldnt ask for anything more than that
4882482 what i wanted to do when i came into the circle because i knew i was one of the first throwers she was out fourth was to put the presssure on the other throwers obviously it worked
4882483 every time they hopped into the circle i was always keeping an eye out because you never let your guard down until the competition is over
4882484 thats why every time i tried to throw it as far as i could i was just so happy that my series right through the competition was awesome
4882485 you know thats something you dont plan it just all happens naturally
4882486 as soon as i saw on the board that it came up that she had won i thought instantly screw the last throw ive done it ive won all i wanted to do was get to the fence and give my coach a massive hug just to celebrate the moment and soak it all in
4882487 its just such an awesome feeling to be out there with so many people around you youve busted your arse in training so hard for this one moment and to have whatever the capacity of the stadium is 91 000 here celebrating with you is just amazing
4882488 she trying to play by two different sets of rules

4882490 closely associated himself with liberal causes and democratic political candidates
4882491 browne brings this action in order to vindicate an egregious intentional false association created by agents of the presumptive republican candidate for president of the united states senator john mccain suggesting that browne sponsors and endorses mccain a false association that directly conflicts with the political and social values that browne has espoused and supported throughout his career
4882492 i dont see the benefit in claiming youre a newbie and only 3 days in the country if anything thats like holding up a big sign saying sucker

4882495 you can see where she gets her work ethic from
4882496 bottom line they all hate linux unix but in the end they all end up using linux unix do i have to say more
4882497 some of us just want an os that runs faster harder and better without caring much about shifting the political spectrum of patents
4882498 linux is by far the best os however most anti linux blogs hate the linux zealots not really linux itself
4882499 in order to improve you need to be open to criticisms even from your enemies
4882500 dont risk your personal and professional future ask anyone linux clearly violates microsoft intellectual property this has been proven in a court of law 1

4882502 during the luncheon following worship dr medley spoke to a number of issues within our denomination beginning with the recent unpleasantness on matters surrounding the issue of sexual orientation
4882503 dr medley went on to share some other observations about our life together he spoke of the catholicity of the american baptist family recognizing
4882504 in all i found in dr medley as i so often do a genuine christian spirit deeply committed to the principles of conscience that ground our denomination in the best of times his visit his presence and his honest addressing of the issues at hand were deeply reassuring to me and should serve to strengthen our continuing relationship with our american baptist family
4882505 beyond these shared values and beliefs a great diversity of personal faith beliefs and values is found and treasured within our community we expect no conformity to any creed
4882506 zoho medal count wiki shows china leading in golds because of womens events
4882507 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4882508 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4882509 amazing as it is the democrats have allowed the republicans to put them on the defensive and swing public opinion in their favor despite having the bush administrations bottomless pit of scandal incompetence high crimes and misdemeanors lift the ban then let oil companies deal with the states and so many environmental ngos in the courts while repealing taxpayer subsidies which should be done anyway and enacting environmental regulations in the next administration its called picking your battles for whatever reason the democrats consistently pick the wrong ones
4882510 congress should lift the federal ban and replace it with strict environmental oversight in the form of expensive bonds while removing oil subsidies and tax breaks then as conservatives always champion leave it up to the states to decide
4882511 the solution for many conservatives is to drill for more oil with prices at historic highs that goes without saying market forces will certainly respond accordingly in addition president bush lifted the executive ban on offshore drilling this may very well be justified provided taxpayers dont subsidize it and oil companies are forced to purchase bonds in excess of any possible cleanup costs associated with a spill more on this later so long as it makes economic sense under these conditions its worth exploring

4882519 theres nothing to do here but watch television play video games and go to the mall
4882520 why not just give up when we see the mess the world is in sometimes we just want to throw our hands in the air and call it quits dont we

4882538 losing by one one hundredth of a second is the most difficult loss especially at the olympics and i did see the replays but if you are asking that im disappointed its a complete miracle to me that i am here and i retired a year and a half ago and i came back to swimming thinking i wasnt good enough to compete at this level and at this competition im enjoying this from my heart i am really enjoying this moment i wish i was a gold medalist but you know ill take a silver medal im very comfortable with this
4882539 yeah i saw the replay a few minutes ago after my race of course i overheard something about there being a protest filed but again im not thinking about this for me its just an incredible feat to have come this far and to win this medal i cant even take it off myself dont know when i can take it off you know if you ask me im not about fighting it if eventually they do decide in my favor that great but i did see the tape it was kind of hard to see i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish thats all im gonna say about that im not angry im not angry at all
4882540 as we all know technology is also imperfect its possible its not something im focused on right now sorry i cant elaborate more on that its possible everythings possible you know the hand is quicker than the eye i suppose but in super slow motion and i overheard michael phelps take about how mark schubert went into the video room and they were filming it to the thousandth of a second and he said it was crazy it was just a crazy finish its too bad that we both couldnt have finished at 50 58 i would have loved to share that gold medal but im taking what i got and im happy
4882541 it could be anything maybe perhaps shaving your fingers i got a funny story right before i walked over to or right after my warm up actually my coach mike bottom walked over with some clippers and he cleaned up the back of my neck he just shaved the hairs that you know were below my cap just behind my neck who know if he didnt do that it might have been 50 60 these sort of differences everything counts again with one hundredth of a second something you cant show is just that fast if it was a forumula 1 race perhaps they could show this since they count thousandths of a second
4882542 i knew i was leading the race i usually do and ive been training all year i know im fast the first 50 i knew i was gonna lead the first 50 and i know that michaels a back half swimmer and that he was gonna be chasing me down in the end so the last 15 meters there was just no point to look over i knew he was there just from my recollection i dont actually remember looking i just saw a shadow out of the side of my goggles and i knew he was coming its a good thing for myself because i like to be chased when i know someone is chasing me i always seem to give a little bit extra the last 15 meters especially the last eight i just put my head down and i did not breathe the last eight meters i was just hoping for the best

4882552 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4882553 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4882554 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4882555 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4882556 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4882564 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation
4882565 john roberts i have to say was a tougher question only because i find him to be a very compelling person in conversation individuals
4882566 he is clearly smart and very thoughtful i will tell you that how i have seen him operate since he went to the bench confirms the suspicions that i had and the reasons i voted against him one of the most important jobs of the supreme court is to guard against the encroachment of the executive branch on the power of the other branches and i think he has been a little bit to willing or eager to give an administration whether it is mine or george bushs more power than i think the constitution originally intended
4882567 whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4882568 how ive seen him operate since he went to the bench confirms the suspicions i had

4882574 why is my life going so shitty right now why cant anything go my way
4882575 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4882576 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4882577 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4882578 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4882579 upon which side shall the democratic party fight upon the side of the idle holders of idle capital or upon the side of the struggling masses
4882580 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
4882581 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death

4882583 si no tengo tiempo para mi vida real menos para hacerme una vida virtual
4882584 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4882585 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4882586 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4882587 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4882588 the word from moscow is that the russians have come under attack by the georgians but the georgians are saying this is a pretext for russia to move a column of armour toward tblisi
4882589 this will destabilise the situation enormously if it is true
4882590 we are now in peacetime why should we be blowing up bridges when our job is to restore
4882591 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4882592 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4882593 quite clearly what saakashvili has agreed to is a reduction in any influence on the georgian side in these two areas south ossetia and abkhazia
4882594 let your friends send in people and we will open everything to them
4882595 gigantic experiment with nature and the whole of humanity which has gone seriously wrong
4882596 im grateful to prince charles for raising the issue he raises some very important doubts that are held by many people
4882597 but government ministers have a responsibility to base policy on science and i do strongly believe that we have a moral responsibility to the developing world to ask the question can gm crops help
4882598 its easy for those of us with plentiful food supplies to ignore the issue but we have a responsibility to use science to help the less well off where we can
4882599 im asking to see the evidence if it has been a disaster then please provide the evidence
4882600 i grow another foot and lose a bunch of weight

4882603 remember a fun read is just that it is not literature still enjoy
4882604 do you think the massive peaceful turnout will have any positive effect on the indian government
4882605 you know gandhiji did not use arms against the british he used non violence to mobilize people is non violence more effective than violence in getting azadi
4882606 i stayed with a bihari labourer who also works for us but two people were killed near by and police picked me for questioning the labourer kept pleading them to let me off but they didnt listen to him as a kashmiri you are always under suspicion
4882607 they have said that they have taken off all 13 and they are all safe and well

4882610 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4882611 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4882612 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4882613 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4882614 so i think the public have got a right to expect that when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4882615 they have said that they have taken off all 13 and they are all safe and well
4882616 it s good that this has ended happily because 125 miles out in the north sea in the dark its not what you want by way of a ship flooding as you are an awful long way from help

4882619 at bottom federal law governs the operation at lake lanier and as much as the atlanta area views it as its private drinking water reservoir that is not what federal law says it was built to do
4882620 if georgia had spent the money to build the reservoir it would belong to georgia but it was the federal taxpayers who built that reservoir
4882621 what they would tell us off the record was that they had a very strong environmental lobby that would never allow them to settle
4882622 georgias holding a pair of twos and theyve called the others states bluff
4882623 the hands that are held by alabama and florida will beat a pair of twos
4882624 the domestic use of water hasnt changed the quantity has changed
4882625 but the purpose of people having water to drink that is one constant
4882626 i did a lot of research and spoke to a lot of auction companies to understand who had the best auction model and who would ultimately deliver the best overall value to rushing amp mason
4882627 ironplanet gave us access to their global buyer base enabling us to exceed our price expectations and the total cost to sell our equipment was the lowest the most important factor was that we were able to sell our equipment straight from our locations
4882628 rising gas prices are having a major impact on individual americans given the increase in prices the irs is adjusting the standard mileage rates to better reflect the real cost of operating an automobile
4882629 we want the reimbursement rate to be fair to taxpayers
4882630 voor het geval jij het jezelf afvroeg ik heet mischa
4882631 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
4882632 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
4882633 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important
4882634 does not apply to civilians working for federal departments or agencies other than dod the department of defense
4882635 if the contractors were not there those state department folks would be guarded by the military prosecutors could argue to the judge that those facts fit within the definition of furthering the defense department mission in iraq
4882636 i think ive put myself a little bit too far back but if i win tomorrow ill change my mind about taking next week off
4882637 i think he was one of the models of how to be a brazilian
4882638 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4882639 torres is a key player and he can change games
4882640 with strikers you talk about goals but he was working really hard against their centre backs it is important for the team to have this type of player
4882641 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
4882642 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4882643 i am confident in us i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4882644 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it
4882645 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4882646 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
4882647 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
4882648 he was friendly to me when i was there today he made funny squeaking noises
4882649 without giving enough time for the defendants to hire a defense lawyer
4882650 i am a layman thankful to his church anchored by his faith and his humble background
4882651 the western amazon is pretty much intact and the reason it remains remote is that there are no roads
4882652 thats why we want an immediate moratorium on new road building before any contracts are signed
4882653 it would be a spectacular failure for conservation if it failed
4882654 the nearness to russian territory of elements of strategic u s power
4882655 they tell us this defense is useful against iranian missiles but no iranian missile has that range it seems evident then that this situation concerns us russians as well
4882656 we must reestablish our position in cuba and other countries
4882657 broaden the process of reestablishing economic commercial and financial exchanges
4882658 at a certain time we came to the conclusion that if we were attacked directly by the united states the soviets would never fight on our side
4882659 and we became totally convinced that that support would never happen furthermore one day we asked that question to the soviets point blank several years before the ussr disappeared tell us frankly no they answered we knew thats what they would answer so then faster than ever before we speeded up the development of our concept and perfected the tactical and strategic ideas with which this revolution triumphed and even defeated on the battlefield an army 100 times more numerous and god knows how many times more powerful in terms of weapons after that reply we dug our roots into our concepts deepened them and strengthened ourselves to such a degree that we can say today that this country is militarily invulnerable and not in terms of weapons of mass destruction
4882660 soccer is my life soccer is my favorite i can not do anything without soccer

4882672 lee has been my guide dog for two and a half years and in this time we have never been separated i cannot imagine the anxiety lee would go through if he is put in a dark hold without knowing if i would pick him up

4882674 i cannot risk putting lee in an unknown and hostile environment away from me because this could have adverse effects on my safety

4882712 let us put together a team to play in fenway
4882713 this at last is one of us exactly what we needed as a helper
4882714 is that fenway park exists because of james mcaleers vision and passion for both the city of boston and the red sox just because some of us have concluded that the document was a combination of two different sports writers does not mean that we dont believe that fenway exists or that the writers were making things up the only people making things up are the people who actually say that we believe such nonsense
4882715 there is not going to be a world rid of drugs
4882716 the russian military has effective control of the gori region making it responsible for the security and well being of all people living there

4882837 midfield was a position we needed to improve on in terms of our overall possession of the ball
4882838 it is an area we are a little bit short and an area we have been trying to adjust since the beginning of the season we have had a little frustration in doing it but we are eventually getting there
4882839 if we do get those two players edu and davis there is maybe one other position we would like to improve on as well so you never know
4882840 it has been difficult enough trying to get in the players we have since the start of pre season
4882841 there is always difficulty in terms of integrating new players into the team we are getting a number of players in just now who have to get to know each other a little bit and play together a little bit
4882842 hopefully over the next four or five weeks we will see it start to settle down a little bit we had a disappointing start to the season but hopefully we can come out of that and be successful in our domestic campaigns this year
4882843 we would hope the addition of the midfield players will help us with this
4882844 a lot of patients wont go out because they are embarrassed by those movements

4882847 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4882848 torres is a key player and he can change games
4882849 with strikers you talk about goals but he was working really hard against their centre backs it is important for the team to have this type of player
4882850 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
4882851 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4882852 i am confident in us i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4882853 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it
4882854 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement

4882864 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4882865 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4882866 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4882867 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4882868 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4882932 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
4882933 on the big issues seiu was unwilling to move anywhere close to our position
4882934 we will now be turning our attention to opposing the ballot issue this fall
4882935 i was living in california in hollywood working at the studio and i thought there was something there journalistically in taking these pictures that were not at all glamorous
4882936 i asked him as a joke wanna come out and maybe write something about these photographs
4882937 t dare not ask your sculpturers name with glance back hooked times hinges halt

4882942 its just a wonderful place to watch a baseball game
4882943 it is hot but we see a lot of major leaguers come through here
4882944 it still comes down to baseball and throwing strikes getting timely hits both teams are uncomfortable playing in the heat for sure but you still need to play the game both sides have to deal with it
4882945 having a bathroom blow dryer just blowing on your face the whole time
4882946 you dont really realize youre getting dehydrated because you dont sweat as much as you do when its humid
4882947 it gets hot out here but you get used to it and you know what they say its a dry heat
4882948 baseballs historically played in the daytime so maybe its a nod to history
4882949 fridays and saturdays are the worst because youve got so many people around you and you always get mobbed by kids that want autographs and pictures and its hard to please everyone
4882950 those nights you get really hot and soaked by sweat youre not moving as much so you dont circulate as much air through your suit then youve got people around so you get heat from all the people
4882951 he doesnt have to share his books if he doesnt want to ive told him that i think that families work better when people share but its important that he comes to that decision on his own

4882970 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
4882971 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4882972 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4882973 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4882974 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4882975 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4882976 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4882977 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4882978 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting

4883096 we invoke the father of our nations spirit and call on them to apologise for the legacy of hatred they left us in the form of section 377
4883097 the idea of treating homosexuals as criminals was imposed on the more tolerant traditions of india and the union government must abandon this abhorrent alien legacy of the raj
4883098 the august kranti maidan was where the quit india movement was launched in 1942 and by making a call from this ground we hope the indian government finally sends section 377 to the dustbin of history where it belongs
4883099 the idea was to provide visibility to sexual minorities especially those from small towns who are harassed forced into arranged marriages and who face discrimination on account of their sexuality
4883100 hiv is transmitted among groups that are not empowered and it is difficult to work in a community that is effectively treated as criminal
4883101 the mark of a civilised society is the way it treats its minorities and it is time india allows its lesbian and gay citizens to lead dignified and honest lives
4883102 its fascinating that such a simple idea has become this festive celebration and though it may not be as glamorous as the ones in new york and san francisco we are getting there

4883147 the authority of the catholic church to teach the truth definitively
4883148 be a source of disunity and cause of confusion among the faithful
4883149 i am convinced that if the pope had spoken clearly at the beginning of the revelations inviting victims to come forward so that the whole truth however terrible might be known and confronted and firmly directing that all members of the church should respond with openness humility honesty and compassion consistently putting victims before the good name of the church the entire response of the church would have been far better
4883150 far too often the catholic church has believed that it had such a level of divine guidance that it did not need the right to be wrong
4883151 as a result both theologically and psychologically it can be bound to decisions of the past

4883157 wrote the book i had intended to write in retirement
4883158 the discussion centered on our shared experiences with clergy sex abuse victims we also discussed some of the financial mismanagement and duplicity perpetrated by church officials bishop robinson expressed his surprise at the extent of financial impropriety he also admitted that he was quite surprised at the consistent problems we have encountered with u s bishops and their response to clergy abuse we expressed our own surprise that he could say based on his experience that the bishops in his country were not acting maliciously our collective experiences have been quite different from his in australia he made it clear to us that he did not disbelieve anything he had heard but was finding it difficult to assimilate it all
4883159 in relation to sex i believe that the first question we need to be asking is not whether it is harming some natural order determined by god but whether it is in any way harming either another person or the community or oneself
4883160 all church leaders have at the very least been through a profound humiliation and embarrassment over this issue and deep within them they know that on this issue the popes have not given the courageous leadership the church needed however much they might pretend to the opposite all leaders also know that we still have much room here for fruitful dialogue parents have an obvious concern for the protection of their children and no sincere leader should refuse to discuss this issue with them
4883161 in which everything that is humanly possible has been done to abolish all forms of abuse a church that encourages growth through freedom a church in which there is conversation rather than confrontation a church in which all women as much as men laity as much as clergy share equally in the full life of the church and can grow to become all they are capable of being
4883162 the church ought to be separated from the state and the state from the church
4883163 in the present day it is no longer expedient that the catholic religion should be held as the only religion of the state to the exclusion of all other forms of worship
4883164 hence it has been wisely decided by law in some catholic countries that persons coming to reside therein shall enjoy the public exercise of their own peculiar worship

4883211 he too recalled barry coming to the prayer room wearing a sarong
4883212 the study of islam was made mandatory in all indonesian educational
4883213 in clear and direct terms obama said his decision to become a
4883214 now add one more factor before obamas baptism at trinity when he was nearly thirty years old there is no other life incident evidencing he is a christian obama had to know that running for political office even state office would be much more difficult to do if voters suspected he was muslim
4883215 yet once obama became a member of trinity he had proof he was a christian as he professed to be
4883216 deciding to be baptized in trinity united church of christ barack obama had to comprehend he was joining a church whose principles were based on the black liberation theology reverend wright professes if obama was smart enough to get a harvard law degree he was smart enough to understand trinity church was and is a black liberation theology church
4883217 however obama joined up with wright and trinity precisely because wrights outspoken profession of black liberation theology matched the radical political ideology obama himself profesed as a direct result of the lessons he had learned from his life experience
4883218 put simply black liberation theology reinterprets the biblical history and teachings of jesus christ to advance a revolutionary racial message
4883219 farrakhan was an anti semite unfortunately there is justification for
4883220 the jews dont like farrakhan so they call me hitler well thats
4883221 what exactly wright and farrakhan accomplished in their 1984 visit to see qaddafi in libya has never been disclosed judging by the history of the relationship between the nation of islam and qaddafi we can safely speculate that at a minimum the meeting further affirmed the anti american views that black muslims and black liberation theology hold in comon with libya
4883222 wright himself has acknowledged the explosive nature of his visit to
4883223 jewish support will dry up quicker than a snowball in hell
4883224 obama needed a christian church in order to succeed in chicago politics he selected trinity because it best matched his personal and political feelings then he dumped the entire relationship when it got in the way of his presidential ambitions
4883225 obama recited for kristof the opening lines of the arabic call to
4883226 we have to ask whether obama by supporting odinga openly in kenya lent his name also to endorse odingas leftist politics and odingas alliance with radical muslims pushing islam in kenya
4883227 on march 30 2001 obama was the only illinois senator who rose to speak against a bill that would have protected babies who survive late term labor induced abortions
4883228 although odinga professes to be an anglican christian concerns even today continue to circulate especially among kenyas christian leaders that odinga intends to pursue an undeclared radical islamic political agenda
4883229 jonsson ny sun sees the recent events in kenya as signaling the
4883230 im here again a thousand miles away from you a broken mess just scattered pieces of who i am i tried so hard thought i could do this on my own ive lost so much along the way then i see your face i know im finally yours i find everything i thought i lost before you call my name i come to you in pieces so you can make me whole
4883231 a hardening has come upon part of israel until the full number of gentiles has come in
4883232 as regards the gospel they are enemies of god for your sake but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their ancestors for the gifts and calling of god are irrevocable
4883233 lord they have killed your prophets they have demolished your altars i alone am left and theyre seeking my life
4883234 lord im all youve got and theyre trying to kill me
4883235 and so all israel will be saved as it is written out of zion will come the deliverer he will banish ungodliness from jacob
4883236 and this is my covenant with then when i take away their sins
4883237 they the jews were broken off because of their unbelief but you stand only through faith so do not become proud stand in awe
4883238 for god has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all
4883239 okay great for the jews but what does this mean for us here and now
4883240 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4883241 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
4883242 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
4883243 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
4883244 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law

4883247 to start with if we should be picky there are no ascii characters gt
4883248 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4883249 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4883250 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4883251 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4883252 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4883253 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4883254 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4883257 we were this close to finishing the continental merger when big mouth glenn blurts out he wants to manage the new company i mean bam it was just glenn and me sitting in a room with 6 other empty swivel chairs a spinning
4883258 see this brown spot on the end of my nose
4883259 yes i have to admit weve succeeded in making our financials so hard to understand nobody even understands how much money were losing
4883260 listen i was surprised as you when glenn said he would groom doug instead of me
4883261 a hardening has come upon part of israel until the full number of gentiles has come in
4883262 as regards the gospel they are enemies of god for your sake but as regards election they are beloved for the sake of their ancestors for the gifts and calling of god are irrevocable
4883263 lord they have killed your prophets they have demolished your altars i alone am left and theyre seeking my life
4883264 lord im all youve got and theyre trying to kill me
4883265 and so all israel will be saved as it is written out of zion will come the deliverer he will banish ungodliness from jacob
4883266 and this is my covenant with then when i take away their sins
4883267 they the jews were broken off because of their unbelief but you stand only through faith so do not become proud stand in awe
4883268 for god has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may be merciful to all
4883269 okay great for the jews but what does this mean for us here and now
4883270 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4883271 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4883272 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4883273 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4883274 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4883275 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4883276 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4883277 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4883278 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4883279 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4883280 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4883281 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4883282 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4883283 i bring you warm greetings from the people of the united states
4883284 we hope this will be the beginning of many years of mutual friendship and economic benefit to both nations

4883301 the black august hip hop project has been a great way to communicate the importance of supporting political prisoners in the u s and the issues our people face locally and all around the globe
4883302 it has cleaned up some of the negativity associated with hip hop and shows that we are self determined and self sufficient

4883313 midfield was a position we needed to improve on in terms of our overall possession of the ball
4883314 it is an area we are a little bit short and an area we have been trying to adjust since the beginning of the season we have had a little frustration in doing it but we are eventually getting there
4883315 if we do get those two players edu and davis there is maybe one other position we would like to improve on as well so you never know
4883316 it has been difficult enough trying to get in the players we have since the start of pre season
4883317 there is always difficulty in terms of integrating new players into the team we are getting a number of players in just now who have to get to know each other a little bit and play together a little bit
4883318 hopefully over the next four or five weeks we will see it start to settle down a little bit we had a disappointing start to the season but hopefully we can come out of that and be successful in our domestic campaigns this year
4883319 we would hope the addition of the midfield players will help us with this
4883320 simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it it only costs 10

4883325 you know you could have broken the news to me better than that when i called today you could have said he was on the roof and wouldnt come down then when i called the next day you could have said that he had fallen off and the vet was working on patching him up then when i called the third day you could have said he had passed away
4883326 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4883327 torres is a key player and he can change games
4883328 with strikers you talk about goals but he was working really hard against their centre backs it is important for the team to have this type of player
4883329 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
4883330 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4883331 i am confident in us i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4883332 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it
4883333 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4883334 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today

4883338 we feel that nepal has found its hero for any epoch changing society we need a hero
4883339 after europes capitalist revolution napoleon came along to institutionalise socialism in russia lenin appeared
4883340 in nepal to institutionalise the federal democratic republic after 10 years of peoples war and mass popular movement prachanda is here
4883341 we have already finished destroying the roots of feudalism in nepal under the leadership of prachanda the main agenda of the new administration will be nationalism republicanism economic and social transformation
4883342 were in talks with the parties in our alliance and hope to form a government in the next few days
4883343 the integration of the peoples liberation army into the nepal army will see lots of arguments and counter arguments the way they deal with the army is very crucial
4883344 the maoists will try to bring in populist and radical economic reforms but financially they will have lots of constraints
4883345 he is a communist hardliner but now he has a responsibility to meet the standards of democratic principles
4883346 this is an acid test for him to prove his commitment to democracy
4883347 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4883348 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4883349 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4883350 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4883351 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4883352 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4883353 weve all talked about it and laughed about it and in some cases cried about it and were all starting to relax now
4883354 this trip has reinforced my po sition on the need for a renewed focus on the nations arctic do main and the coast guards capa bility and capacity to meet our sovereign and statutory responsi bilities for the safety and security of that domain
4883355 we are moving for ward responsibly and deliberately to ensure that the coast guard is prepared to effectively execute and efficiently support our critical missions in this increasingly im portant region in the future
4883356 this collaboration will assist both countries in defining the con tinental shelf in the arctic ocean it will also save millions of dollars for both countries provide data of great interest to both countries and increase scientific and diplo matic cooperation
4883357 operating ca pabilities of small boats heli copters fixed wing aircraft and their requisite command and con trol are limited by the unpre dictable rapidly changing and often harsh weather including drifting ice and frequently re duced visibility of the arctic envi ronment we also have a greater awareness and sensitivity to the logistical challenges in terms of limited infrastructure and the fi nite availability of lodging and food services
4883358 the integration of ukrainian elements of missile early warning and space control systems with those of foreign countries that are interested in gathering space data
4883359 could prevent any actions like those which occurred on 7 8 august at first in south ossetia and then in other regions of georgia
4883360 hamas is trying through this so called legal proceeding to legitimize its human rights violations and assaults on the freedom of expression

4883384 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4883385 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4883386 something that i think if we were at a different part of the season in the standings and so forth he would pitch through it but at this point wed like to take the opportunity to just stretch him out a bit
4883387 hopefully get him ready to come back in september and be himself

4883430 my cousin goes there no sports and he says its a great campus and environment he says that id really like it there
4883431 id like to take a few early visits and see how the teams do i want to see how they all look and how they play its really not going to make a difference if they are winning or not but i just want to see how id fit in

4883441 high school students used to say that they didnt have to worry too much about their academic preparation because theyd say i can always get into the u
4883442 i think that shows when he goes out and talks to constituents the legislature the faculty
4883443 you cant deny his commitment and his vision for the university
4883444 you could have put ideas out there faced so much headwind and resistance and had people sort of give up
4883445 hell be like a dog on a bone hell just keep working it and working it
4883446 i put out a lot of feelers and tried to find out who was the most effective dean on campus someone who can make hard decisions and retain the confidence of the faculty and alumni
4883447 not only knew where the bodies were buried he helped bury a few
4883448 i tackled some issues but there were some sacred cows i didnt want to go after
4883449 i was more stubborn and argumentative than im normally inclined to be
4883450 when i used that word publicly that so resonated with people
4883451 to criticize your university is a pretty harsh thing to do
4883452 some of us were a little concerned with the amount of money the university spent fighting the central corridor route thats the type of thing that if youre a legislator and youre concerned about high tuition it obviously catches your attention
4883453 i would put financing the future of the university as one of the two or three biggest challenges we face
4883454 wed be extremely fortunate to be one of the best schools in the big ten
4883455 continuing on with this orwellian third best public research university in the world business in light of reality is an embarrassment and only serves to make us look naive and foolish
4883456 we know how hard it is to compete against the other top universities
4883457 we know its a very challenging economic time for the state and the university its hard to do everything we need to do to be top three i think thats where the frustration ends up coming out
4883458 if i do serve that full three or even two of that three ill be the second longest serving president in the last 35 40 years at the university of minnesota
4883459 we want to implement the biomedical science program to continue the private fundraising for the stadium

4883465 last june after all attempts at peaceful negations were exhausted all the musicians in our orchestra united filed a law suit against the associa o musical do algarve to contest the legality of our working contracts and the conditions under which we work
4883466 when the orchestra started in 2002 the number of musicians agreed upon in the documents was 16 and all of the provisions were made for this number only the will to increase the orchestra and allow for a greater repertoire meant that the formation grew to 31
4883467 as much as we would like to significantly improve the musicians work conditions we are limited by financial restrictions which cannot be overcome in the short term

4883478 not a jack of all trades and master of none but rather an expert across disciplines
4883479 even if the students primary area of study is physics for example he or she should be also capable of producing the quality of biological research expected of biologists
4883480 the innovation of inbt graduate programs is the bringing together of talented students from a wide variety of backgrounds we teach each other about our fields which also requires learning our own more in depth
4883481 the students in a sense play matchmaker for researchers who might not otherwise work together this helps everyone involved produce work that uniquely advances nanobiotechnology in a way that it could not have been had these researchers been working independently
4883482 i really broadened my understanding of molecular biology and was able to work with quantum dots and use lab techniques such as gel electrophoresis or pcr that i had only read about

4883496 despite the governments tough offensive against organized crime and drug trafficking violence in general this year murders have increased to the point that in just eight months weve surpassed the 2 673 murders we had all of last year
4883497 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
4883498 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen

4883501 did the thief on the cross keep the ten commandments
4883502 i dont know why i was given this to deal with
4883503 i couldnt be more satisfied and i was proud of my performance here
4883504 according to the room full of medical professionals it isnt
4883505 to celebrate the first of what im sure will be
4883506 i came here just to win and i did just that i didnt even know id broken the world record until i did my victory lap
4883507 now im just concentrating on my two races coming up i came here prepared and im going to try and do it the 100 and 200m double
4883508 im just happy i wanted to please myself and i did that
4883509 i didnt come here to set the world record because i am the holder i came here to win
4883510 i hope to win three gold medals the 200 plus the relay i am happy to make the country proud and to do it again for them in the 200m
4883511 the celebration it wasnt planned i was just celebrating i was pretty happy
4883512 i dont care about the rumours hes been tested over and over again
4883513 i say to them to come down come down and see our programme come down and see our testing and see how we operate come down anytime day or night we have nothing to hide
4883514 he is the best ever sprinter and ive said that before
4883515 he has run 9 69 and got the gold so he is definitely the greatest it was a spectacular performance and he was definitely the best here he could have run faster if he had run straight through the line
4883516 i was feeling good but i didnt feel it in my legs they died on me
4883517 it feels good to be here to be part of history
4883518 it was good to finish behind him bolt because theres no way anyone on earth could have beaten him tonight
4883519 to finish second to him that is a great accomplishment in itself usain is a great athlete it was just a matter of time before he proved himself on this stage
4883520 i cant be more satisfied with third place he bolt broke the world record you cant ask for more
4883521 everyone could see what he did he didnt even push through the line its an amazing time

4883523 but these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4883524 georgia is a member of the united nations and south ossetia and abkhazia lie within its internationally recognized borders georgias borders should command the same respect as every other nations
4883525 both countries should resolve all bilateral issues including the kashmir dispute through dialogue and adhere to the peace process
4883526 at times harsh statements emanating from either side cast a shadow over the cordiality of relations between india and pakistan but the regular contacts at the highest level would help to dispel the uncertainties created by them
4883527 the greatest enemies of india and pakistan are hunger poverty ignorance disease and terrorism and both the countries needed to work together to fight these adversaries
4883528 welcomed this proposition and assured his indian counterpart of his governments resolve to work for strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries
4883529 such interaction would serve to build bridges between the political leadership of two sides and bring the people of india and pakistan ever closer to each other
4883530 contacts at personal level of leadership would greatly help in building confidence between the true representatives of the two democratically elected governments and in overcoming the misgivings held by two sides about each other
4883531 as requested by you we hereby submit an offer for a surveillance method of the encrypted voip protocol skype
4883532 encryption of communication via skype poses a problem for surveillance of telecommunications all traffic generated by skype can be captured when surveilling a dial in or dsl link but it cannot be decrypted the encryption of skype works via aes with a 256 bit key the symmetric aes keys are negotiated via rsa keys the public keys of the users are confirmed by the skype login server when logging in to surveil skype communication it thus becomes necessary to realize other approaches than standard telecommunications surveillance
4883533 we proposed that a referendum needs to be held at the entire land of palestine so that its whole residents including the jews the christians and the muslims would be able to decide their own countrys fate
4883534 this proposal is made based on the charter of the united nations the international laws and the rules of democracy but those that claim to be the standard bearers of democracy do not accept this solution
4883535 but i humbly tell you that the expiry date of that regime is over now that it is segregated in the world that the world nations and many governments are fed up with it and that it is left alone even in its own region
4883536 the best thing to do for those that established this regime is to de establish it and to clean the mess they should permit the people of palestine to choose a political system for themselves
4883537 at the beginning of the press conference you spoke of the hard times that the world nations are suffering from
4883538 as we see the neo colonialists are now oppressing the peoples of afghanistan iraq and other vast regions in the world those powers posses weapons of mass destruction and they commit all types of mischief against the mankind the same posers have found fault with the nuclear program of iran and are after imposing mounting pressure against you how do you evaluate such double standards
4883539 they are opposed to the advancement of countries like iran and turkey they wish us to remain dependent on big powers for good they are the enemies of our development programs otherwise the nuclear program is nothing but a pretext for them
4883540 fifteen years ago when there was no sign of the nuclear program the united states unilaterally imposed sanctions against us under such conditions that we had just got rid of the imposed war that the western governments had intrigued against us and we were thinking about reconstruction
4883541 let me narrate a memory for you tow years ago we discussed the nuclear issue at the us foreign relations council
4883542 the members of that council had a meeting with me they asked many questions and i replied ot all of them at the end one of them said we confirm that what you are doing is legal and within your rights range you have the right to be benefited from the nuclear energy and you have not breached any of your commitments but there is a problem if we would permit you to take advantage of the nuclear energy tomorrow turkey saudi arabia and egypt too would demand the same what could we do with them then
4883543 i told them what is wrong with that if it is a right for entire nations permit them to use it and if it is not do not use it yourselves either of course they had no convincing response basically they do not want to permit such countries as turkey iran and egypt to become advanced countries
4883544 they have not only not yield to getting disarmed from their horrendous nuclear weapons so far but also manufactured the fifth generation of those deadly bombs on the one hand and kept on creating obstacles in the way of the other countries that wish to have the nuclear power for peaceful purposes
4883545 what can iran and turkey do in solving this particular crisis
4883546 is your trip to turkey meant to expand bilateral ties or to send messages to world from here
4883547 the foreign policy of the islamic republic of iran is constructed based on countering oppression and irrational pressure and therefore iran would resist against oppression and bullying resorting to its entire capabilities
4883548 we held comprehensive talks about oppressive relations governing the world and the problems caused by such relations for the iraqi palestinian afghan georgian and other nations and we would try to root out such problems from the human society
4883549 a number of cooperation documents were signed following the first round of talks between the two countries presidents but no document to push forth the two countries cooperation in energy field were among them why is it so and what will be the process of iran turkey cooperation in the energy field
4883550 a very good letter of agreement has been signed by the two countries for cooperation in the energy field including investment in the electricity and gas sectors and the two sides will try to implement it in shortest possible time
4883551 of course you have to keep in mind that implementation of huge oil and gas contracts is usually time intensive and they differ with the contracts for exchange of other commercial deals involving purchase of a commodity investments in such fields has certain delicacies and implementing them too is time taking
4883552 you said at your thursday joint press conference with president abdullah gul that irans nuclear issue is totally political and you spoke about the us stands you also sent message on regional issues and said that if the us forces leave iraq iran will be ready to fill the resulting vacuum you elsewhere claimed that iran is the worlds most powerful country such messages are observed at arab countries of the region with a high level of concerns how would you explain such worries
4883553 i added that in that case there would be a vacuum and the regional countries would have to help restore security and fill the vacuum
4883554 there is no need for the others interference we believe entire countries need to support the iraqi government since iraqs independence integrity and security is to the benefit of everyone
4883555 all such objectives can be secured at a time that the legal iraqi government would take the full lead of that countrys security political and economic affairs
4883556 mr president you would exit this hall in a while to attend the congregational friday prayer at an ottoman era mosque since congregational friday prayers are regarded as political moves in iran what is the meaning of your attendance at this ritual in istanbul
4883557 i am very glad to attend such a prayer do you not think the presence of the president of iran at such a prayer in istanbul is a major political move boundaries of islam are far beyond the political and geographical barriers the friday prayer is a religious political move therefore presence at istanbul friday prayer is renewal of solidarity with the people of turkey this is a major political move
4883558 i was in a really tough spot there i had kind of a downhill bunker shot and downhill lie
4883559 i told my caddie if i made it i would do a snow angel then i made it and chickened out but it was a great shot and i was happy to finish that way
4883560 it was nice i had a lot of support out there
4883561 i played really good out there im a little disappointed with my putter but i felt like i played really good and handled myself well
4883562 when i was in high school i used to come out here and watch the pros and dream about playing in this tournament it would be something special to win here tomorrow
4883563 im really happy to be out here playing and playing well
4883564 im having a lot of fun and this is a great golf course ive made a lot of putts this week
4883565 ok so in his opinion we were 700 000 apart and the club walked away is that what he said we were the only club to walk away well hes the only agent that didnt sign his player either and he didnt sign his player over 700 000 hes the only agent that didnt do a deal
4883566 we only regret that we werent able to sign him
4883567 had we known that aaron crows number was 9 million we would have passed on the player
4883568 we dont have it in the budget to pay that kind of money
4883569 common sense says a compromise deal for the no 9 pick is 4 million
4883570 we tried to value the player properly and we tried to negotiate a contract to sign the player
4883571 the decision to turn down the offer the nationals made was made pragmatically and had to do with the financial terms
4883572 there is a new magog this one shot examines his motivations and history
4883573 bosse sois content davoir un job et ferme ta gueule

4883580 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4883581 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4883582 shall be commander in chief of the defence forces of zimbabwe
4883583 mr mugabe will be head of state and mr tsvangirai will be head of government with executive power
4883584 the hurricanes which have been raging recently off the american coasts were created by russian military specialists using a special electromagnetic generator they have perfected a secret meteorological weapon capable of striking innocent people from any distance and destroying their homes
4883585 the project for active research on the northern lights being to blame
4883586 the base where this research is taking place is a specially secured secret alaska territory
4883587 it is enclosed by a barbed wire fence the perimeter is guarded by armed marine corps patrols and the air space over the research area is closed to all civil and military aircraft
4883588 after the collapse of the ussr work was stopped as funding was cut
4883589 the apparatus began to rust wild grass grew on the field
4883590 if climatic weapons do exist then they have even been made secret from the specialists
4883591 new hurricanes will be directed at major american cities marking the start of a weather war
4883592 i personally have seen artificial clouds over the state of montana and i started to feel ill
4883593 it must be said that even in america only a very small number of specialists have voiced their support of stevens
4883594 most scientists think that these accusations have no basis in fact as they are inconsistent with elementary laws of thermodynamics and studies on hurricanes in the same way there is definitely no foundation for accusing the usa of intentionally sending extraordinarily cold or thawing weather to russia
4883595 i do think its fair to say that in the past few months and particularly over the summer we have seen increasing signs that this parliament is really not working very well anymore its becoming increasingly dysfunctional
4883596 this is the prime minister who made a virtue of passing fixed election date legislation and now hes threatening to cross sussex drive and go see his neighbour the governor general and ask for an election because hes fabricating a crisis where none exists
4883597 la turba m s violenta que en el inicio se lanz contra la caravana motorizada y lanzaron nuevamente piedras y palos
4883598 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
4883599 india are looking to have uranium for clean energy purposes by 2050 35 per cent of all of their power needs could be met by nuclear energy and that would save an enormous amount in terms of greenhouse gasses
4883600 it is the one policy thing that prime minister kevin rudd could do which would have more impact than anything else in australia to lower global greenhouse gas emissions
4883601 we must maintain our relations build our relations with other major countries such as india and the selling of uranium is one way of doing that
4883602 pol ticamente inaceptable que el partido del gobernador del zulia manuel rosales un nuevo tiempo unt
4883603 no podemos seguir perdiendo el tiempo haciendo encuestas y compitiendo entre nosotros tampoco se puede garantizar que se hagan las primarias
4883604 respetar la unidad as como nosotros respetamos la candidatura de pablo p rez y manuel rosales en el zulia exigimos lo mismo antonio ledezma quien lidera las encuestas est respaldado por m s de 20 organizaciones pol ticas y de la sociedad civil
4883605 y miente porque es antonio ledezma quien lideriza las encuestas y est respaldado por m s de veinte organizaciones pol ticas y de la sociedad civil
4883606 yo tengo que decir que desde hace tiempo algunos partidos vienen haciendo piruetas para inventar un candidato y ponerlo contra ledezma y despu s que ojeda pierde en sucre lo sacan de sucre y lo lanzan a la alcald a mayor sucre representa 18 para la alcald a mayor y all perdi c mo va a ganar en la mayor si es un candidato asomado
4883607 todos saben que yo soy el candidato de la unidad por respeto a la opini n p blica no voy a debatir sobre las afirmaciones de omar barboza presidente de unt y la inscripci n de un candidato a ltima hora william ojeda todos saben que yo soy el candidato de la unidad el adversario con el que voy a competir tiene nombre y apellido se llama arist bulo ist riz
4883608 otra gran alegr a compa eros y escuchen que es muy importante el aplastante triunfo del compa ero evo morales en bolivia qu paliza que le dio a la oposici n
4883609 los socialistas del siglo xxi no les tenemos miedo a nuestra gente as se hable que hay dictaduras de que hay intolerancia
4883610 cu ndo en la historia los presidentes de am rica latina han puesto a consideraci n del pueblo sus mandatos y la presidencia en la historia reciente s lo dos veces evo morales que le acaba de dar una paliza y hugo ch vez que tambi n le meti otra paliza a la oposici n
4883611 han sido una minor a pero total m s de 2 a 1 les ha dado porque ya llega a 68 por ciento el triunfo de evo morales
4883612 debo recordar que hay tres generales de la polic a que est n en santa cruz asumiendo y ejerciendo el mando nico nacional quienes determinaron dar la baja al coronel obleas por razones de salud y eso me parece bien
4883613 esperamos que la escalada de violencia que desataron c vicos y seguidores del prefecto cruce o no tenga mayores consecuencias en los siguientes d as
4883614 en ning n momento se pens en la figura de la militarizaci n el gobierno descarta esta posibilidad y controlar el orden con la instituci n que corresponde
4883615 la ausencia de la representante de la familia marinkovic es una muestra clara de c mo ellos est n intentando perjudicar y obstruir la justicia esperemos que la jueza tome en cuenta estas acciones a la hora de dictar las medidas cautelares
4883616 pareciera que el gobierno moral de los cruce os el comit c vico se convirti en un instrumento de agresi n y despojo
4883617 cualquier boliviano m nimamente informado se da cuenta de que las autoridades judiciales de santa cruz ser n v ctimas de presiones muy fuertes si se trata de enjuiciar a branko marinkovic
4883618 resolver n el asunto con rectitud y que esa tierra tan injustamente despojada les ser restituida a los guarayos
4883619 we intend to fight for it in the senate the liberal party appears to be siding with big oil who dont want consumers to know where they can get the cheapest petrol in any price cycle
4883620 well we do so were going to get up there and fight for this measure
4883621 i think its a very important initiative for competitive markets and if you believe in competitive markets whether its banks or whether its groceries or whether its fuel then you should put in place measures which can empower consumers
4883622 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4883623 torres is a key player and he can change games
4883624 with strikers you talk about goals but he was working really hard against their centre backs it is important for the team to have this type of player
4883625 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
4883626 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4883627 i am confident in us i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4883628 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it

4883642 frankly i think it is time for middle class christians to reexamine our love affair with our individualistic lifestyles and explore community and co operative based models
4883643 i am persuaded that a biblical view of the church is really a call to become part of a new family that transcends race class and even biology
4883644 one of the most compelling characteristics of this new first family as it emerged in the early church was the remarkable way these first followers of the way loved each other and their neighbours communities like the jerusalem church sold their possessions and shared their resources like one large family christians rescued infants from garbage dumps and brought them home they cared for those in their neighbourhoods who were ill sometimes with highly contagious diseases while they didnt all live under the same roof they operated more like a large organic extended family
4883645 the single family detached model of housing has become a cultural icon in western countries what i think has happened is that we have not only allowed modern culture to largely define our notion of what constitutes the good life but we have allowed those same values to influence the decision about how we house ourselves doesnt this iconic model place individualism above community and privacy above mutual care

4883650 it is also a system of critique and has as its central focus the concept of patriarchy which can be described as a system of male authority which oppresses women through its social political and economic institutions feminism is therefore a critique of patriarchy on the one hand and an ideology committed to womens emancipation on the other

4883657 demographers say the rapid change in south koreans feelings about female babies gives them hope that sex imbalances will begin to shrink in other rapidly developing asian countries notably china and india where the same combination of a preference for boys and new technology has led to the widespread practice of aborting female fetuses

4883664 the reason the earths surface is this warm is the presence of greenhouse gases which act as a partial blanket for the longwave radiation coming from the earths surface this blanketing is known as the natural greenhouse effect
4883665 much of the thermal radiation emitted by the land and the ocean is absorbed by the atmosphere including clouds and reradiated back to earth this is called the greenhouse effect

4883667 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
4883668 the desire to save humanity is always a false front for the urge to rule it
4883669 this crippling of individuals i consider the worst evil of capitalism i am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils namely through the establishment of a socialist economy accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals in such an economy the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion a planned economy which adjusts production to the needs of the community would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man woman and child

4883671 the modern literature on hate crimes began with a remarkable 1933 book by arthur raper titled the tragedy of lynching raper assembled data on the number of lynchings each year in the south and on the price of an acres yield of cotton he calculated the correla tion coefficient between the two series at 0 532 in other words when the economy was doing well the number of lynchings was lower in 2001 donald green laurence mcfalls and jennifer smith published a paper that demolished the alleged connection between economic condi tions and lynchings in rapers data raper had the misfortune of stopping his anal ysis in 1929 after the great depression hit the price of cotton plummeted and economic condi tions deteriorated yet lynchings continued to fall the correlation disappeared altogether when more years of data were added

4883673 we understand why theyre doing it because they have an opportunity to make a large part of their athletic department budget

4883675 i dont have a crystal ball to see how its going to change
4883676 it means were always going to have a i aa team on the schedule because you can get them for 300 000

4883696 although it is not necessary to know a great number of soups it is highly desirable to have at least one well tried recipe for every season of the year and then one will not be led into the expense of buying out of season vegetables or into the error of unnecessary substitution
4883697 on several occasions i have tried when leeks were out of season using onions instead so i have given up trying to make the soup when no leeks were available have each one as good as possible of its kind
4883698 of course i never follow a recipe i just improvise as i go along
4883699 the fortunate ones gifted with that touch are those who will also have the restraint to leave well alone when they have hit on something good the ones who cant resist a different little piece of embroidery every time they cook a dish will end by inducing a mood of gloomy apprehension in their families and guests

4883801 he has refused to listen to us on a critical issue to our community the right to live at home in the community
4883802 the community choice act would allow that obama will give us choice and help us liberate the people in nursing homes
4883803 based on a candidates support or opposition to an issue that impacts people with disabilities
4883804 it would require asking very sensitive questions in a survey which would lead respondents to hang up
4883805 i think people with disabilities vote just like anyone else does
4883806 i think they vote on big issues like war in iraq and the economy like others
4883807 it goes to the candidate who talks most about disability
4883808 i think the more people know that he has a disability the more it is likely to help with this community
4883809 it was surprising that given doles ada sponsorship and disability that he did not carry disabled voters
4883810 i think that was because clinton was the first president to establish an office in the to work on disability he had a very strong record it was the first time we had seen anything like that
4883811 the only party that is really addressing that is the and everyone in our community knows that
4883812 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4883813 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through

4883815 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4883816 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4883817 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4883818 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4883819 i was happy we were able to come back and jump around on the field a little bit
4883820 by no means do we think were hot shots but we promise you we can get better
4883821 i think overall our run fits are better were getting good play out of the safeties and thats important the value is on being smart
4883822 its a response to the fans that i heard on the radio after the giants detailed their psls

4883843 i was just reading your article about different diaper rash creams pastes ointments and wanted to share with you what our pediatrician told us when our daughter had her first diaper rash he suggested that we make our own paste using a amp d ointment and maalox that sounded really strange to me but we tried it and it worked wonderfully the maalox we used the minty one not only helped with the odor of the a amp d but it also helped cut down on the greasiness weve had to use this only a few times in the last 18 months and each time its done the trick in no more than a day
4883844 diaper rash is easily confused with eczema and the treatments are completely opposite one another i kept drying and drying my sons red bottom only to learn that it was rashy from being too dry
4883845 my pediatricians office recommended a combination of arbonne herbal diaper rash cream for as a shower gift one week after my daughter was born an ugly rash developed and i used several of the ointments on your list but none were doing the trick on her i pulled out the arbonne cream as a last resort and was absolutely amazed after two treatments one before bedtime and one during the middle of the night it was gone by morning since then i have never used anything but arbonne on my daughter if i see any redness i jump right on it and it never has a chance to develop i use it on scrapes bug bites pretty much any red rash or spot i see on the whole family it is truly amazing
4883846 the best diaper rash cure i used was menthol shaving cream any brand is fine i used this on my son and daughter when their bottoms were so sore and nothing else worked a friend told me about this and i tried it what a difference by the next diaper change i have worked in day care for over 30 years and always suggest this when parents ask me what i used to use my kids are nearing 30 now
4883847 sir i have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up and while i am making my way someone else steps down ahead of me

4883852 my father is still working and i also am working
4883853 he did not throw as well as he had been throwing it and the soreness probably had some impact
4883854 hes just worn out he hasnt been used to throwing this many balls
4883855 hes got some awareness but hes young and has a lot to learn
4883856 we couldnt block him very well in pass protection and its been going that way most of fall camp hes a much improved player from what he was a year ago our guards have got to start blocking better
4883857 i thought that would be a very solid group for us but its a group that needs a lot of work in the next couple of weeks
4883858 the first team didnt play well but the next guy that went in didnt play well either
4883859 we might have to mix it up to try and motivate but i cant tell you one guy who played well enough to move up from the second or third teams
4883860 i would have hoped our running game would be further along i thought our passing game would be a little bit behind but right now theyre both the same we havent run the ball well we havent thrown the ball well
4883861 weve got a lot of questions weve got to get answered and weve got to get them answered in a hurry

4883878 the performance was exactly what we wanted after last weekends defeat and the way weve done it was a great advert for championship football
4883879 im more pleased with how we played in the second half than the first it was fortunate for the players that it was 1 1 at half time
4883880 we were fortunate to get the equaliser in the first half from nowhere either side could have scored at any point
4883881 the beauty of the black female body before they asked you to do pilates
4883882 myself and my team are determined to clamp down on violent crime and what makes this incident so disturbing is the fact it is racially motivated

4883894 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
4883895 india are looking to have uranium for clean energy purposes by 2050 35 per cent of all of their power needs could be met by nuclear energy and that would save an enormous amount in terms of greenhouse gasses
4883896 it is the one policy thing that prime minister kevin rudd could do which would have more impact than anything else in australia to lower global greenhouse gas emissions
4883897 we must maintain our relations build our relations with other major countries such as india and the selling of uranium is one way of doing that
4883898 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
4883899 india are looking to have uranium for clean energy purposes by 2050 35 per cent of all of their power needs could be met by nuclear energy and that would save an enormous amount in terms of greenhouse gasses
4883900 it is the one policy thing that prime minister kevin rudd could do which would have more impact than anything else in australia to lower global greenhouse gas emissions
4883901 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4883902 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4883903 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light
4883904 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4883905 what i amp squo m trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4883906 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4883907 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4883908 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4883909 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4883910 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4883911 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4883912 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4883913 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4883914 so i think the public have got a right to expect that when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4883915 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4883916 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4883917 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light

4883919 the condom fits 100 perfectly so the safety is much higher than a standard condoms and it feels more natural

4883922 he just stopped his truck by the side of the road jumped out and started shooting
4883923 my family and i were up here on vacation and this wacko just levels his canon at us i tried to jump in front of the kids but i think he got some shots off at them as well
4883924 i shutter to think how much worse this could have been
4883925 ive never seen a lunatic take so many shots but not injure anyone

4883931 american theatres in the south rejected the first movie refused to play it because the word hell was in the title
4883932 other theatres in the south changed the title on the marquee from hellboy to hello boy and heck boy
4883933 we actually went back to discussing can it not be called hellboy again
4883934 i find it really puzzling that we are not prudish about the deforestation of the earth bombing other countries killing children raping entire continents but we are prudish about one word
4883935 hellboy made a combined profit of around 90 million theatrically and on dvd
4883936 i kind of hope that part of it is our offense is just a little off right now
4883937 the defense played good two weeks in a row came out here and whipped our butts i dont think ive ever been in a scrimmage here where the offense didnt score a touchdown in 11 years thats the first time thats ever happened
4883938 anthony and mcginn know what theyre doing but the three other guys are still learning theyve got the tools but they arent doing as well as wed like right now they got their butts kicked if theyre getting the better of us in the middle were going to struggle
4883939 i dont think we have the luxury of time to say its early in the season the first game is only two weeks away we know weve got a lot of work to do and we have to get better
4883940 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number sunday for somebody to win the tournament

4883942 if he can be friendly and make a bunch of pars it would leave a lot of people back in it

4883948 the olympics by itself is an embodiment of a sort of chinese coming out party
4883949 the chinese are looking at the olympic games as the kind of washing off of all humiliation and bad things that china used to represent
4883950 chinese canadians still hold dear the fact that they are chinese when china becomes a super nation they feel proud they feel that their status in society is tied directly to how china is being thought of on the world stage
4883951 its a waste of time and money china should focus to better peoples lives than to use so much resources on face painting event like the games

4883972 we are pleased to report an increase in our revenues for the first quarter of 2008 which were largely due to the performance of atiam a technology company that we acquired in october of last year and to a lesser extent an increase in commission revenue in our telesales business
4883973 atiam contributed significant revenue and a modest profit to our results and as part of our technology portfolio further positions us for continued growth and execution on our strategy to be a technology innovator to theinsurance industry as part of this atiams inspro product continues to be highly visible and well received in the insurance carrier and tpa market place

4884056 the first one i thought should have been caught to be honest with you but i can understand some reluctance its his first time out there but i think with more experience hell catch that ball
4884057 its just another step of them throwing me out there and seeing what my limits are what i can do to help the ball club
4884058 financially we got to where we needed to be it wasnt about the money he wanted to go to college i really thought we were going to sign him
4884059 one of the guys that i probably try to emulate more than anybody
4884060 i was managing in harrisburg in 1987 and we had some pretty good players on that club but we didnt have a very good team
4884061 it was the end of may and we lost 11 games in a row all of them on the road it wasnt a whole lot of fun i was in a hotel room at the red roof inn in albany n y and leyland called me
4884062 he said hey listen are they playing hard and i said yeah he said are the fundamentals being done right and i said yeah he said dont worry about it it will be ok from that point on we went 52 28 and won the whole thing he was a big league manager and he took the time to recognize what its like for somebody who is down in the trenches because hes been there
4884063 midfield was a position we needed to improve on in terms of our overall possession of the ball
4884064 it is an area we are a little bit short and an area we have been trying to adjust since the beginning of the season we have had a little frustration in doing it but we are eventually getting there
4884065 if we do get those two players edu and davis there is maybe one other position we would like to improve on as well so you never know
4884066 it has been difficult enough trying to get in the players we have since the start of pre season
4884067 there is always difficulty in terms of integrating new players into the team we are getting a number of players in just now who have to get to know each other a little bit and play together a little bit
4884068 hopefully over the next four or five weeks we will see it start to settle down a little bit we had a disappointing start to the season but hopefully we can come out of that and be successful in our domestic campaigns this year
4884069 we would hope the addition of the midfield players will help us with this
4884070 i love the new book but i wonder about milk touched by the lips of a serpent i refer of course to the non iskcon people represented in your book shouldnt we only hear from authorized representatives who embody the mood of lord chaitanya
4884071 why do i even want to know about these people outside of iskcon why should i care about what they have to say
4884072 when one is encouraged in devotional service by the association of devotees one becomes free from all unwanted contamination
4884073 those who merely appreciate the chanting of the holy name can be counted amongst the vaishnavas
4884074 all living beings are actually vaishnavas since all souls are ultimately servants of krishna
4884075 there are no hard and fast rules for chanting the holy name
4884076 one does not have to undergo initiation or execute the activities required before initiation one simply has to vibrate the holy name with his lips thus even a man in the lowest class candala can be delivered
4884077 a mantra not received through an authorized lineage will not bear fruit
4884078 its not like theyre chanting the maha mantra srila prabhupada
4884079 they are engaged in glorifying the names of god so it is alright do you want me to be sectarian
4884080 an elegant sufficiency content retirement rural quiet friendship books ease and alternate labour useful life
4884081 i got my extreme i got my release ive found some opportunities for peace i can finally hate enough to let go
4884082 overall four of the ten bestselling ds games in both countries during the first six months of 2008 were in the brain training genre
4884083 according to data released by sales monitor media control gfk international the dss heavyweight status in the european console market is closely tied to the popularity of nintendos brain training series and other brain training titles
4884084 the biggest demand for brain games is in germany and holland
4884085 for me when youre in a big club the important thing is that you are fighting for the title
4884086 is finishing 12th and winning the league cup a successful season for us i dont think so
4884087 you see the real quality of a team after 38 games in the league cup or the fa cup if you win five games you can be in the final
4884088 if you dont win the league of course you are frustrated but the levels are very high possibly the highest in the world and two or three points is not a big gap we finished with 83 points last season and everywhere else in europe that would have made us champions
4884089 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4884090 i am confident in us we lost only three games last season and we have a stability in our club which means we can keep improving
4884091 i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4884092 i dont want us to be known as little old albion and we are going to strengthen the squad over the remainder of the transfer window
4884093 i hope we can add at least four bodies over the next few weeks because we want more quality out on the pitch
4884094 midfield was a position we needed to improve on in terms of our overall possession of the ball
4884095 it is an area we are a little bit short and an area we have been trying to adjust since the beginning of the season we have had a little frustration in doing it but we are eventually getting there
4884096 if we do get those two players edu and davis there is maybe one other position we would like to improve on as well so you never know
4884097 it has been difficult enough trying to get in the players we have since the start of pre season
4884098 there is always difficulty in terms of integrating new players into the team we are getting a number of players in just now who have to get to know each other a little bit and play together a little bit
4884099 hopefully over the next four or five weeks we will see it start to settle down a little bit we had a disappointing start to the season but hopefully we can come out of that and be successful in our domestic campaigns this year
4884100 we would hope the addition of the midfield players will help us with this
4884101 my commitment to the club is 100 per cent i have said a hundred times that my family are really happy here and i want to win trophies for liverpool
4884102 it was typical of him we know he can score those type of goals but the rest of the team still needs to play well and keep a clean sheet
4884103 we dropped off torres 25 yards from goal and he pulled the trigger thats why he cost a few bob and thats the beauty of the premier league
4884104 we tried in the 10 or 15 minutes and that probably affected our decision making
4884105 until then we had defended very well but a lot of teams do score late in the premier league
4884106 i was really pleased with the performance though i think we played some good stuff and created one or two good chances
4884107 but when you play the big boys youve got to take those chances it would have been very hard for liverpool if we had gone in front
4884108 im encouraged by the performance when we played teams like liverpool last season i hoped we would get a good result this morning i thought we would get a good result
4884109 liverpool will be delighted to see the back of us and thats a decent sign for us
4884110 the this parameter to the call must be the callng methods this parameter
4884111 you can support us or leave to our fate but if they come for us and all hope is gone we will turn the middle east into a radioactive wasteland until the end of time
4884112 they are obviously the poorest and the most vulnerable among those displaced we find out that those who are living in those tented camps have usually been evicted many times from public buildings that they had been occupying illegally and because they are a small number they probably have not received the assistance they deserve especially considering that these camps are sometimes in fairly remote locations and usually are set up in barren empty land
4884113 for the moment hes a spurs player and im happy with him
4884114 hes part of the squad and ive nothing else to say about him there has been no transfer request and i like great players
4884115 we opted for geovani as the second striker because i thought his speed would trouble middlesbrough when they tired late in the game
4884116 we are most impressed by his thoughtful and genuine answers we especially like his answer regarding abortion he we did have other avenues than abortion the vast majority of women would take them
4884117 his dialogue on prolife and abortion issues were well spoken and clear i think he does a good job of maintaining a clear view of the rule of law and yet makes his answers human and clear i liked this section the best so far
4884118 he comes across as very non threatening and easy to like im suffering some cognitive dissonance because i know a lot about his background
4884119 i almost fell off the chair when he started talking about reforming the tax code that is really making a change and one thats long overdue but one of his answers its not about me really rings true it isnt about him its about our country and the world i wish he were stronger on same sex marriage and im a happily married 58 year old from georgia but a girl cant have everything
4884120 he walks among us but he is not one of us
4884121 connected we are coincidence i think not fate has brought us here
4884122 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4884123 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
4884124 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
4884125 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
4884126 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law
4884127 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4884128 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4884129 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4884130 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4884131 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4884132 when they made forced entry into the showroom it was fully charged with smoke
4884133 there are six cars in the showroom so theres going to be a tremendous loss at this establishment
4884134 its about community its everyones stadium this is the peoples stadium
4884135 i want to say thanks most of all to the workers who made this marvel possible
4884136 indianapolis has worked too hard to attract and hold on to certain conventions and special events some of those meetings were starting to outgrow us and those organizations were turning to other communities that were building new venues
4884137 with todays grand opening were more than back in the game weve moved back to the forefront
4884138 indianapolis is already americas leading sports city and this gold medal stadium confirms that
4884139 indy and indiana can be very proud of everything that has been done to make this possible
4884140 you probably look at this place and say its magnificent
4884141 but you dont know how magnificent it is until you get inside

4884157 its how we came to be here with you in the first place now you see why our story had so many holes in it i will explain everything to you
4884158 we dont need to know nuthin about it just keep it to yer selves i dont know what that thing is that you boys got but somethin like that sure could be a knockin on a fiery dangerous door
4884159 i just want to go back home be with my family eat a polish brat from the market
4884160 i know its difficult to be so far from home
4884161 maybe one of us can go back to check on our families someday
4884162 yes i am a man who has vaulted his worldly body through time
4884163 we all are vaulting through time and if so are not we all time travelers our bodies the vehicles in which to travel through time
4884164 ive returned to ask one favor of my friends the travelers
4884165 it is not important ive been in hiding far away from here
4884166 the rumor has it you and your friend just disappeared into thin air
4884167 i beg you to not worry with the details of my past it would be better if you didnt ask i only come to you to learn the fate of my wife angelina and my child i also about the family of timothy axmacher can you help me
4884168 mr de le vaunt the details of their demise isnt a pleasant story sir and none which is verifiable by us so many rumors have passed
4884169 well the grapevine has it that she was detained by the authorities after your disappearance
4884170 well sir they are one and the same now apparently she was coerced into petty theft due to lack of income they arrested her and sent her to prison she served her time then returned home where she eventually met another man they settled north of the city with a child and perhaps more by now she married the captain of a river freighter who lives most of the time atop his cargo vessel transporting burlap cotton bales you would recognize him by his thin moustache and his immense appetite for bathtub gin
4884171 only in the legends of hobo travelers is my legacy i was now free from the past and the grip of the chicago underworld
4884172 gentlemen im touched by your generosity but you dont need to go to such lengths and we dont exactly have a down payment for a mortgage
4884173 ed isnt there some way we can help to repay these generous people for all that theyve done for us
4884174 we could just steal what we need from the bosses back in chicago
4884175 obviously as time travelers we could resort to unethical behavior theft or other illegal pursuits but this wouldnt be a wise or ethical direction for us
4884176 lets perform and sell our music i wondered where and how and how much could we get
4884177 we cant get much here or in chicago at least not these days
4884178 then what about the future why dont we perform there
4884179 economic growth raises the level of wages and the cost of goods over time
4884180 what if we were to work in the future and live in the past
4884181 thats it ed well perform in the future and travel back to the holler and well all live like kings
4884182 all of the coins and paper money would be dated in the future wed be considered counterfeiters and stupid ones at that
4884183 there aint no markings on that we could take our performance money and buy gold we could even melt it down for that matter
4884184 first lets go into the future and have a look around
4884185 at least we can find out if this is even possible
4884186 you boys look happier than a tick whats got you in such high spirits
4884187 tim and i wanted to give you and your clan something in return for all this kindness youve showed us
4884188 jobs in the future making a great deal of money playing music

4884192 wed like you to accept our good fortune as yours
4884193 it sure is heavy well ill be look at that
4884194 now just where did you boys get these and where am i gonna cash it in
4884195 i cant do it around here or ill have every county sheriff bandits of all sorts knockin on my doorstep
4884196 youll travel to a large city sell the gold there so no one local gets wind of it
4884197 atlanta would be a good place and you certainly can afford the train tickets now
4884198 gosh boys i wont have to cook moonshine anymore whatll i do with myself
4884199 once you get the gold cashed in rainbow weve got a plan that will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams
4884200 well we can buy land here that we know will be valuable in the future well buy it for pennies now of what its gonna be worth in 50 years your grandchildren and our grandchildren will inherit wealth that will appreciate over time and on top of that its not illegal yet
4884201 time travelers might even buy licenses for this kind of thing in the future like a drivers license
4884202 well i gotta tell ya i dont know exactly how that thing you got works but it sure is some dandy trick are ya sure we aint gonna get caught at nothin

4884219 david cronenbergs films are full of images that make us recoil but what we are really trying to hide from writes j g ballard is the messy business of being alive

4884226 excessive speculation in any commodity under contrasts of sale of such commodities for future deliver causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in the prices of such commodity is an undue and unnecessary burden on interstate commerce in such commodity

4884237 caseys father contrary to the latest spin was not denied the right to speak at the 1992 convention because he didnt endorse bill clinton
4884238 the democrats with the help of their friends in the media will now use the pennsylvania pro abortion senator to sell the message that they have gotten beyond their anti catholic reputation that reputation which was played out in 1992 by delegates who wore anti papal buttons at the convention still sticks if they are serious about reaching out to catholics and jettisoning their anti catholic baggage once and for all they can allow a prominent catholic to speak in denver who is truly pro life that should be an easy choice to make given the small pool of eligible candidates
4884239 historic moment that does a lot for democrats catholics and women
4884240 strongly an unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
4884241 from the campaign i suppose i should feel worse for barry bonds the athlete comments
4884242 it says in the email that it will take 4 5 days to process and 7 10 days to receive it im assuming thats business days also and not just days meaning it will probably be 2 3 weeks before you see it show up its only been 8 business days since we all recieved the emails and the said it can take up to 15 days if you add in the 4 5 day processing time so
4884243 our findings uniquely focus on structure the actual aspect of the molecule that encases its function
4884244 look over walls or into compounds in afghanistan will prove a real asset to the troops the only problem so far is figuring out a way to minimize noise because really what good is a spy when everyone can hear it coming thats some
4884245 the contrast between the soft issue obama and the tough pragmatic mccain couldnt be more pronounced obama seemed to slide into his answers after having to find what he wanted to say while mccain knew exactly where his beliefs come from in our home mccain won after answering the first couple questions
4884246 responses very caculated and i also feel patronizing he does not come across as smart star material as did obama i think there will be more about his failed marriage and the way he lied about the circumstances and brushes it off so half handed
4884247 mccain started out okay when he got a laugh but petreaus lewis and meg whitman
4884248 i like how he worded it the failure of my first marriage was my greatest moral failing how about some honesty heres what he should have said my greatest moral failing was having an affair with my current wife cindy while my former wife was recovering from a severe car accident and im sorry for having lied about the fact that cindy and i were having that affair while i was still married to my first wife he made it sound like it was a flan in the cupboard that fell
4884249 his mentioning of his marriage was one of the most courageous confessions in public i have ever heard a politician make
4884250 i feel obama came across weak on pro choice same sex marriage and stem cells
4884251 his inability to place in context the interests of the international community as often hostile because their views of economic philosophy and global leadership are often antagonistic to ours and that too often result in our having to reject their analysis of foreign and our domestic agendas
4884252 his stance on abortion that seeks to minimize it and his inability to admit the immorality of abortion while recognizing the social economic and interests of expediency that play into that issue
4884253 his refusal to accept personal responsibility for education income family needs etc and instead assuming society is obligated to provide for these needs first and only if individuals can not provide for themselves should government taxpayers intervene or be responsible
4884254 his assumption that global warming is significantly caused by human activity is nonsense carbon excesses have been proven to follow increases in global temperatures not precede it and many other reasons indicate that we have very little if any ability to affect the temperature of the earth to spend trillions to try is a criminal exercise in futility
4884255 waving the save the children flag may be good politics but it ignores serious technological problems which will likely cause the proposed scheme to fail
4884256 furthermore australia is supposed to be a liberal democracy where adults have the freedom to say and read what they want not just what the government decides is appropriate for them
4884257 these announcements smack of the condescending paternalism which contributed to the downfall of the howard government
4884258 the proposals threaten the free speech rights of every australian and our concerns will not be silenced by government sound bites equating free speech with access to child pornography
4884259 who decides what is appropriate for adult australians to read on the internet and according to what standards
4884260 what will happen if the government decides that information about abortion or gay marriage is inappropriate at the behest of family first senator steve fielding
4884261 if people equate freedom of speech with watching child pornography then the rudd labor government is going to disagree
4884262 senator conroys attempt to equate freedom of speech with access to child pornography is a transparent attempt to deter criticism of this fundamentally flawed proposal
4884263 this can only have the effect of making australians access to the internet slower and more expensive
4884264 given the prime ministers election promise to focus on improving the nations access to broadband the fact that the first measures put in place should do the exact opposite is as disappointing as it is bewildering
4884265 anyone with a better understanding of the internet than the minister will tell you this system simply will not work
4884266 but a lot of taxpayers money will be wasted if we try
4884267 unfortunately isp based filtering will not make the internet safe for children and may even cause harm in and of itself if parents are deceived into believing that a filtered internet service is safe for children they will be less likely to take sensible precautions such as supervising their children while they use the internet
4884268 the coalition was rightly ridiculed by the rest of the world when they announced in the late 1990s that they would censor australians internet access the coalition at least sensibly realised that their proposals were technologically infeasible it seems that the current minister with responsibility for the internet has yet to learn that lesson

4884275 its a device that will save our necks by transporting us through time
4884276 it can dematerialize any human being or inanimate object within a variable circular radius
4884277 once a coordinate is selected we ring the time bell so a dematerialization of our molecular structure takes place and the traveler is transported through a time portal and wherever he is standing at that moment is where hell be standing at the given coordinate in time
4884278 ive never tried it but once but before i transported i stopped at the doorway of time
4884279 well we have no better moment in time than now my friend to test it

4884308 we could be rich we could travel throughout time to the end of the world and back
4884309 we cant go back yet there are time paradigms to contend with were still not safe and we dont know the fate of our loved ones
4884310 we could have the world at our fingertips or at least do some good with it
4884311 for over a thousand years men exploited the bell medallion for conquest and grasped only desolation in the end we must be wise in our use of its power lets just try to enjoy our time here now were in seemingly good company with rainbow

4884350 de ontwikkeling in het zwemmen gaat momenteel te snel het is hetzelfde als wanneer bij het voetbal van de ene op de andere dag de doelpalen verder uit elkaar worden gezet en de lat hoger komt te liggen zodat er meer wordt gescoord zulke kunstgrepen heeft de zwemsport niet nodig
4884351 maar dat neemt niet weg dat ik hier ontwikkelingen heb gezien die me zorgen baren innovatie is goed maar we moeten de sport beschermen tegen excessen gezien de frequentie waarmee hier in peking wereldrecords worden gezwommen en de marges waarmee dat gebeurt kan niet verondersteld worden dat zoiets louter het gevolg is van goede training van de atleten
4884352 our management is being held hostage by our tech team
4884353 we dont know if it was a rocket or what we will interview everyone and determine the validity of what was seen
4884354 robert morehead an engineer and president of the amateur spaceflight association in houston said model rockets routinely can reach as high as 40 000 feet he said model rocket enthusiasts are supposed to notify the faa if a rocket is entering controlled airspace laura brown an faa spokeswoman in washington d c told the chronicle that model rockets have crossed paths with planes before but have never struck them she also said that the memorial day holiday weekend was a good time for a launch uk ufo police helicopter crew reports near collision with ufo
4884355 it closed in at great speed aiming straight at the helicopter the chopper had to swerve sharply to avoid being hit the guys said if theyd stayed where they were theyd be dead it wouldve been a direct hit they are convinced it was a ufo it sounds far fetched but they know what they saw these guys are hardened professionals and know people will take the mickey but they are certain they saw a ufo after the near collision they decided to follow it to find out what the hell it was they belted across the bristol channel in pursuit but it was too quick they got to the north devon coast and had to turn back because they were running low on fuel
4884356 south wales police can confirm the south amp east wales air support unit sighted an unusual aircraft

4884359 while we currently have no explanation why certain places in the uk are alien hot spots as the research reveals there are areas where mysterious objects are repeatedly witnessed

4884383 we are using native plants and grasses identified in an 1819 land survey to return the site to the way it was then a haven for birds mammals amphibians reptiles and insects
4884384 im not afraid here now and there was a time when i was very afraid
4884385 i think fernald is a good model for other sites
4884386 a plan was developed that the community was comfortable with and that didnt push all of the waste into someone elses backyard but that recognized the need for monitoring the site in the future
4884387 sometimes i look out my office windows and i can almost see the ghosts of the workers and buildings that were here for so many years
4884388 its often hard to believe that weve come this far

4884393 as a federal officer trained in the safety and handling of weapons the defendant should have known better than to draw a gun absent an imminent threat to the safety of himself or others

4884395 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
4884396 mispronunciations are misinformation the casual attitude of the networks towards this matter is at best negligent and at worst bordering on disrespect for china and the chinese

4884398 prepare to help at risk groups such as people who cant afford to stockpile food dont speak english or need assistance with daily activities get through a pandemic
4884399 in the face of a pandemic we have to recognize that some of those services that serve them vulnerable groups today may be able to expand to meet the need but some of them will break down
4884400 how will we provide basic services to people who are homebound for example making sure they have food and water and care this wont happen by accident
4884401 h5n1 bird flu virus has shown signs of mutation and can kill human victims more easily
4884402 recent data on receptor binding domain changes suggest one or two changes could produce an efficiently transmitted h5n1 which when linked to the current high case fatality would have catastrophic consequences
4884403 one of the reasons that we are not constantly overrun with avian flu viruses popping straight out of birds and into people and why we havent yet had a human h5n1 pandemic is that bird infecting flu virus h proteins bind to a sialic acid sa 2 3gal actose receptor which in birds is predominantly found in the enteric tract which is why the virus is shed prolifically via faeces in birds but is not much found in humans except for deep in the respiratory tract which is difficult to reach thus while humans can be infected by h5n1 viruses this is rare and so far onward transmission to other humans has not been reliably documented human adapted flu viruses on the other hand bind preferentially to an sa 2 6gal receptor which is found predominantly in the upper respiratory tract meaning the virus can much more easily infect and be transmitted the frightening thing is that it takes only a few mutations in the h gene 3 in the case of the legendary h1n1 spanish flu pandemic virus to change from one type to the other and only 2 to bind both types relatively weakly so prasert auewarakul and colleagues have isolated from a fatal infection of a 5 year old boy a population of h5 ha sequences which are distributed evenly between the bird type sa 2 3gal binding and a mutant type sa 2 3gal and sa 2 6gal binding the mutant ha protein had two substitutions at positions 129 and 134 ll129v and a134v these two residues are located close to part of the receptor binding domain and apparently alter the binding specificity by changing the configuration of the binding pocket the implications of this are very worrying indeed a lethal virus which can bind both bird and human receptors was selected for in a single bird human transmission event just like the spanish flu h1n1 ha reconstructed from archival tissue samples which we should need no reminding went on to kill in excess of 60 million people in the age of the steam train and ship this means that we could be just one infection away from the big one with death tolls predicted to be in the range of tens of millions
4884404 weve been so close before it feels good to put a ford here in victory lane
4884405 we always enjoy racing here in front of the home crowd

4884407 its not like i wont ever get to see those guys the no 20 crew again but i know its the last time im going to drive that car for those guys
4884408 when youre that successful you hate to see it end
4884409 on old tires when handling was more important we could run the top of the track and keep our engine wound up
4884410 i felt like we had something for em but unfortunately we just ran out of time
4884411 i think we had a better car than edwards did
4884412 but with the new toyota restrictor plate nascar put on us he definitely had us beat on power theres not a lot we can do about that
4884413 well it kept them from having a giant advantage the whole day like theyve had for the first half of the year
4884414 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable
4884415 but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual the company is cooperating fully with ongoing investigations and believes that accountability is important

4884417 if the contractors were not there those state department folks would be guarded by the military prosecutors could argue to the judge that those facts fit within the definition of furthering the defense department mission in iraq

4884423 allah had this ocean not come in our way we would have continued with waging jihad against the enemies of islam and eliminated the non believers from the earth
4884424 the day is not far away when all non muslim nations would get united against muslims and launch strike jointly
4884425 will it happen because muslims will be less in number against the enemies
4884426 no you will be more than the enemy but you will be like foam which has nothing in it and has no power or strength allah almighty because of your cowardice would remove your fear from the hearts of non muslim powers and would fill your hearts with cowardice

4884428 in the loneliness of jail in malta i pondered over the causes of muslims ruination both religiously and temporally i found out two causes one forsaking the quran two internal differences and discords from the jail i have come with a resolve that i would spend the rest of my live in promoting the quran and its meaning there is a need that madrasahs for children are set up in every town and village to give children the literal education of quran and public gatherings are organized for enlightening the adults with the meaning of quran and preparing them to act accordingly and the internal differences among the muslims should not be tolerated at any cost
4884429 take my cot to the meeting place all people of wisdom and knowledge from all over hind are present there they must elect an ameer i will be the first person to pledge the oath of allegiance at the hands of that ameer

4884459 what do you achieve by spending huge money on your missionary colleges and schools
4884460 it is true that we have never been successful in making muslim students to come into the fold of christianity but our objective is not really to convert muslims into christians our aim is to bring them under the influence of christian culture and society if they dont come into the fold of christianity then it is more than enough for us that they at least dont remain complete muslims our mission is not to leave muslims to follow their religious path but they should be westernized if this is done then mission is complete and we think the money we are spending on this mission is not going waste the curriculum given by lord mikaley also teaches this that dont leave muslims on their religious path
4884461 a missionary is never happy by establishing a hospital although its earning is more than the total earning of oman but the main objective of a missionary is to convert muslims into christians
4884462 imparting education in missionary schools is a mission to achieve certain objective and that objective is to bring the human being under the influence of christianity
4884463 70s show y en la pel cula the dukes of hazzard

4884516 id like to think im not completely over the hill yet the guy that got the silver medal today was juri jaanson and he is 42 he is nine years older than me and as long as im still worthwhile out there be it rowing or sailing there is certainly a desire to keep doing sport while i can

4884662 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4884663 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4884664 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4884665 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4884666 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4884667 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4884668 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4884669 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4884670 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4884671 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4884672 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4884673 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4884674 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4884675 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4884676 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4884677 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4884678 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4884679 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

4884706 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4884751 we have lost one forward robbie keane lets just see if were capable of adding to the squad in one or two areas putting an end to any purchases and then seeing how we can get everyone to play as a team and as an efficient unit
4884752 nasri has shown that he is an intelligent player with a good technique who can integrate well with the rest of the team
4884753 our defending at times was rubbish we had experienced players internationals who were not at the races today
4884754 we gave away a daft free kick for their winner and even then ryan nelsen was offside when the ball came into the box
4884755 it was hard for the linesman to see that but nelsen had moved from an offside position to head against the bar
4884756 arguably we should have got something out of it palacios was superb the kid has got everything you want in a footballer and if he keeps playing like this hell be a fantastic one
4884757 it was arsene who recommended him i was trying to sign mathieu flamini for birmingham at the time and couldnt get him but wenger said ive got this lad from honduras on trial and hes worth a look

4884761 at times in the first half we were on the back foot and their goal knocked the stuffing out of us
4884762 we were chasing shadows for 15 minutes after that and if they had got a second it probably would have been game over
4884763 i was in contact with tom hicks and he told me we had the money we have sold players for more than 20million in the summer and he told me if you sell players you can buy with that too
4884764 i have the support of at least one of the owners
4884765 obviously deans got to be picked for england yet but if he is and hes pain free in the morning he will be available to play
4884766 weve just got to hope its only cramp with craig bellamy and kieron dyer still out its the last thing we need from our point of view to see deano out as well
4884767 he has done ever so well and is in a real run of goals scoring six in five pre season friendlies after his late burst last season
4884768 hes leaner too hes worked hard and has been on a different diet it would be a real shame if hes got another injury now but i think hell be all right

4884789 it has 23 olympic medals thats more shooting medals in just one unit of the army than any other country except china
4884790 ive been in the special forces for 21 years and i thought i knew how to shoot but in 20 minutes with these guys they taught me how to shoot better
4884791 if you look at the position these guys take when they are shooting it has a direct correlation to the positions you take in combat we say its competition to combat
4884792 we train the sergeants and ncos of the army so they can help better prepare the younger soldiers and themselves for going overseas
4884793 with the shotgun unit we do close quarter combat which is clearing houses and various stuff that has to do with shotguns

4884801 its the way people depend on all those bells and whistles that come with the software to try to shore up a weak presentation
4884802 to critics powerpoint serves largely the same role in the classroom as pre processed snack food does in the lunchroom a conveniently packaged morsel that looks good but doesnt match the intellectual or corporeal nourishment of say a critical essay or a plate of steamed spinach
4884803 the practical conclusions are clear powerpoint is a competent slide manager and projector but rather than supplementing a presentation it has become a substitute for it such misuse ignores the most important rule of speaking respect your audience
4884804 the use of the powerpoint presentation has been a disaster it should be ditched
4884805 lecturers who know nothing else except their powerpoint slides they are just powerpoint notes not process they have no stories no biographies no histories
4884806 of course powerpoint is not inherently evil it is just poorly used
4884807 oh man i dont even have time to try one or even read this list and now you give me 75 come on

4884818 its interesting that when i was in toronto last thursday for the tv awards i must have had 15 clubs and 10 league executives approach us to say they were going to be coming to this event
4884819 hopefully this will be something that the nhl will look at as a bridge between the end of the hockey season and the start of another and really be a great marketing tool not only for the blackhawks but for the league
4884820 after all children cost their parents more in food and college tuition than they bring in

4884828 any contact between opposing players while pursuing the puck on an icing must be for the sole purpose of playing the puck and not for eliminating the opponent from playing the puck
4884829 unnecessary or dangerous contact could result in penalties being assessed to the offending player
4884830 provides if a puck is shot off the goal frame goal post or crossbar the subsequent face off will remain in the end zone where the puck went out of play
4884831 its unfortunate that he would say that because theres a guy i really admire
4884832 i look to him as a wayne gretzky type of person that always does the right things and says the right things not only for his sport but as an ambassador for sport in general
4884833 i remember him coming into dallas dressing room with fellow golfer mark omeara in 99 when we were in the conference final against colorado
4884834 he seemed to be a hockey fan then and i know hes played golf with wayne before so im really surprised he said that
4884835 team 3 lost the first two games in the series and team 3s owner complained to nba officials
4884836 team 3s owner alleged that referees were letting a team 4 player get away with illegal screens

4884995 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

4884997 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

4884999 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4885000 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4885001 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4885002 we want to make sure that were offering the same things as the other gas stations

4885006 merdeka kan artinya semua merasa bebas dan aman melakukan sesuatu itu belum saya rasakan lihat saja tidak ada bis khusus orang cacat seperti saya marcello harus beraktivitas dengan kursi roda masalah pendidikan juga begitu hanya sedikit universitas yang bisa menerima kami artinya saya pribadi belum merasa merdeka

4885009 who are the three wisest people you know in your life and who are you going to rely on heavily in your administration
4885010 who is not only wise but shes honest and one of the things you need i think any leader needs is somebody who can get up in your face and say boy you really screwed that one up you really blew that
4885011 what ive found is very helpful to me is to have a table where a lot of different points of view are represented and where i can sit and poke and prod and ask them questions so that any blind spots i have or predispositions that i have that my assumptions are challenged

4885014 when i first got there and saw the vastness of it i thought oh my god well never find it it took about an hour and 40 minutes it was amazing and a relief to find it so quickly
4885015 there was nothing outwardly suspicious about the vehicle but we will have it processed forensically
4885016 there were no signs of a struggle or foul play inside or around the residence
4885017 he was pretty lonely he was just out there looking for some friends its just unfortunate

4885019 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4885020 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4885021 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4885022 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4885023 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4885024 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4885025 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4885026 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4885027 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4885028 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4885029 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4885030 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4885031 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4885032 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4885033 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4885034 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4885035 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4885036 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4885037 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4885038 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4885039 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4885040 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4885041 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4885042 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4885043 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4885044 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4885045 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4885046 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4885047 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4885048 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4885049 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4885050 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4885051 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4885052 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4885053 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4885054 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4885055 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4885056 obviously today we have been concentrating on the game and since yesterday our minds have been on the game
4885057 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it i dont have any comment to make on it
4885058 we actually opted for giovani dos santos because we thought that his speed would be something that would trouble middlesbrough
4885059 however as middlesbrough tired in the game we thought it might be the right moment in the game to throw on berbatov
4885060 having added strength up front is a situation i really enjoy
4885061 ideally i like to operate with four experienced strikers as we did when we won the treble when we had andy cole dwight yorke teddy sheringham and ole gunnar solskjaer
4885062 it was an admirable strength to have when it came to the end of the season and we were competing on three fronts with key games coming at us thick and fast
4885063 if our plans do not come to fruition it is hardly the end of the road

4885065 i was looking forward to meeting her shes a great person great personality
4885066 i was crying on the way up here i was like oh my gosh
4885067 sometimes twice a month depending on how many gummy bears you needed
4885068 theyre coming home from iraq a place where they get shot at daily it was exciting to be here to meet her
4885069 i hope may i come to georgia i can always venture down there believe me you know
4885070 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4885071 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable

4885073 have they no care for sweet innocent children cursed with chinese peasant teeth as incidentally are most of the british
4885074 why this base act of trickery is the perfect metaphor for everything the chinese have been doing openly with nary an apology for as long as anyone can remember
4885075 the producers have decided to go for a different look
4885076 for the wii balance board although we have nothing announced yet
4885077 ive played a lot of games and ive never seen anybody do something like that
4885078 those can be real tricky whether its interference or whether its not interference
4885079 i thought it was fine i think the key words in the rulebook are impair impede intent i didnt see any of those three he just went straight in i think he did ok
4885080 when theres something bad in the neighborhood who ya gonna call he man he man he man
4885081 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4885082 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4885083 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4885084 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4885085 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4885086 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

4885088 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4885089 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4885090 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4885091 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4885092 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4885093 los parecidos existen porque los que operan o inyectan a veces son animales que ni siquiera hicieron la residencia

4885104 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4885105 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4885106 nolan told me that were going to take a system wide new approach to pitching in the offseason
4885107 were talking about training development conditioning he doesnt believe in putting a limit of 100 pitches a game on pitchers he wants our pitchers to be stronger and better conditioned throughout the system
4885108 we got decimated by injuries this year hopefully that wont happen next year our young guys are gaining valuable experience the team rays were playing this week is not a bad example they had some young guys who struggled and now theyre doing pretty good
4885109 we tried hard to get barry zito and thank god the giants outbid us if nolan and general manager jon daniels has one out there they feel is special ill listen but i think its foolish its the biggest high risk and not necessarily high reward contract youre better off developing your own young pitchers or trading for young pitchers
4885110 i told them i thought our guys did a great job of getting the job done and balancing it all out
4885111 the agent wants more and the commissioner wants less one day well have a hard slot system but until then weve got to go through the dance
4885112 there was a chance of going back to school but in the end of the day i made a decision to be a texas ranger
4885113 we got it done and im very excited going into friday i felt we would get something done i didnt realize the business side of it but now i do the only thing i want to do is play baseball and thats very exciting
4885114 have i faced a 95 mile per hour fastball lately no i havent
4885115 ill need to practice take a lot of batting practice strap it on and play every kid wants to be in the big leagues as soon as possible my goal is to go out and play let the chips fall where they may have fun and whatever happens happens
4885116 after the game he indicated that when he threw his last bullpen session he felt something in his right elbow
4885117 he hadnt said anything to anybody then but after friday nights game he said it was sore
4885118 if we were in a different part of the season and the standings he could pitch through this
4885119 but at this point were going to take this opportunity to give him four or five days give him a couple of bullpen sessions and have him come back in september
4885120 mr larkin turner aged 110 years died february 23 1878 he like the patriarch of old waited for death having set his house in order when he felt the approach of death he settled himself firmly in his chair refusing to lie down and died sitting erect and without a struggle he retained his senses to the last moment and died from no disease nature exhausted during his long life he had but one short attack of fever having never taken a dose of medicine until that time which was about the time he was at 100 years of age this he told us himself
4885121 mr larkin turner died in meriwether county recently aged one hundred and ten years until he was one hundred years old he had never taken a dose of medicine this is probably the reason he died people should always take medicine

4885124 who are you calling clown there is nothing odd about my appearance
4885125 is that you responded like calling you a clown was a bad thing
4885126 because thatd imply that you think clowns or calling someone a clown is an insult
4885127 so you were scared of clowns when you were a kid
4885128 but you must have been a clown kid back then huh
4885129 the look in the kids faces as they get school supplies is amazing and we are just so happy to be apart of it

4885132 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4885133 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light warren said earlier in a statement
4885134 religious right movement of conservative evangelicals with whom he has endured a testy relationship
4885135 the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern said michael dimock associate director of research at the pew research center
4885136 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4885137 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4885138 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4885139 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy

4885177 the super bowl has long been a family event that is enjoyed by viewers of all ages to feature a halftime show that includes nudity and lewd behavior is unconscionable
4885178 unfortunately this ruling will likely set a precedent that will negatively affect the quality of future entertainment on broadcast television

4885180 young iraqis in baghdad are surfing the internet to search for partners to tie the knot as violence and sectarian tensions take their toll on more traditional forms of socialising dating has fallen victim to the insecurity that has reduced the capital to a sullen network of rival neighbourhoods leaving little space for men and women to meet other than in cyber chat rooms
4885181 i like for the people to enjoy what little bit of enjoyment they can enjoy without being bothered i like that and it looks like its turning that way since they have been making those changes and i think thats really good for the neighborhood good for the city and good for me
4885182 all the guys are out there playing their hardest because we have to get the team ready for saturday just because youre part of the scout team and a walk on doesnt mean youre not part of the team you contribute every week
4885183 theyre a part of the team that we cant do without
4885184 without those guys and the role that they have wed have a hard time practicing i have a lot admiration for those guys because theyre not out there getting a scholarship for what theyre doing i have a lot of respect for those guys
4885185 my hopes are to make the traveling squad maybe sneak my way onto a couple of special teams
4885186 its tough getting reps right now im trying to get more reps as a widout its definitely tough especially with the level of competition
4885187 my strength is definitely my size and also my hands i have pretty good hands
4885188 im also fearless im not afraid to get hit my weakness is definitely my speed just getting in and out of cuts you have to be quick getting in and out of those cuts is really what the coaches are looking for
4885189 its not necessarily the breakaway speed but if you want to be a possession receiver you have to get in and out of those cuts
4885190 if circumstances happen where some guys were to go down he could have a chance
4885191 everybodys got a chance to play everybody on this team has a role and their roles are really defined so they all know what their role is i tell the guys that whatever their role is to do it the best they can in the country and well be successful here
4885192 he needs to give our team a good look and prepare our guys
4885193 my freshman year i didnt know how the whole walk on process worked
4885194 i was playing basketball against some of my now teammates and i started to realize i could hang with them some of them came up to me and said maybe i should walk on to the team and see what i can do so then the spring of my freshman year the next summer and the next fall i just got myself ready to try out the next spring
4885195 i have a ton of respect for the walk ons
4885196 they come in here they have to pay for their education and still be on a football schedule and on that football schedule you dont have a lot of time off
4885197 its a lot of hard work and nothings ever guaranteed
4885198 you have to work hard here to make the traveling squad which is my goal
4885199 fall camp last year was definitely intimidating especially following bc all the previous years you dont know what youre getting yourself into but once you get going and into the flow of things you just go with the flow and you work your way in there
4885200 i believe hes one of the guys who gets a great amount of respect
4885201 hes a quiet leader but hes a leader he gets guys going hes pretty good scholarship or no scholarship ive seen him make some great catches out there on the field hes got a pretty good chance if he keeps working hard and hes one of the hardest workers
4885202 john is a smart kid he knows what to do out there
4885203 he works hard and i give him a lot of credit hes a walk on trying to get playing time im good friends with john he works very hard in the weight room i lift with him a lot of the time and hes always doing extra stuff in the weight room just trying to get better

4885211 when i was young far out was a popular little quip
4885212 no dad this is just funny to know you listen to rock music
4885213 yeh but wicked and hits from the wedding singer broadway version dont count
4885214 but this is a little heavier rock than some of the shit ive heard you listen to
4885215 why is it so crazy that your father would like heavier rock
4885216 you play beethoven bach and broadway you dont play bon jovi
4885217 but i am at least still versatile in my musical tastes
4885218 why can a 16 year old mexican be cool but a 42 year old caucasian dad cannot
4885219 i know how old i am and i am cool too
4885220 you know jose when i went to pick up molly crouch for her lesson thursday i was telling mrs crouch about beavercreeks show and when i said we were doing a bon jovi medley she said i bet one is living on a prayer mrs crouch is about four to five years older than me mrs branson even knew the songs and she use to like some of the heavier rock bands in the 1970s
4885221 when the hell did you start listening to bon jovi
4885222 ive always liked rock music and why is everyone saying hell today

4885226 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4885227 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4885228 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4885229 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4885230 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4885231 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never see these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys

4885236 you cant measure the quality of the organization or its institutional progress by the number of charges its laying per se
4885237 thats not a fair way to measure on the other hand extremes do tell a story

4885245 there is an issue of public perception as to the partiality or impartiality in terms of these investigations and whether or not the police officer is being treated in a similar fashion as a member of the public would
4885246 there is a need i think as a matter of policy for greater transparency saying what the decision was if its to prosecute its clear in court if its not to prosecute why
4885247 i think thats just a reflection of the evolving public expectations the public cynicism about public institutions is higher now its more cynical now and for that i think we collectively have a responsibility to look at how we do business and make greater efforts to be transparent if we can

4885294 russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
4885295 russia also holds vast petroleum wealth and this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that russia is clearly prepared to use

4885302 these plans are not punishing or penalising lone parents its about supporting parents to be full participants in society and not having to opt out of employment or education just because they have a child on their own
4885303 if we are seriously talking about tackling poverty and child poverty in particular then we have to support lone parents
4885304 hopefully this will support a change in thinking for fathers to become more involved and that will support the child as well

4885487 banyak telah kita lakukan pada hari ini telah dilakukan secara rahsia 25 tahun yang lepas oleh cia
4885488 cia telah menggunakan yayasan yayasan yang terkenal di as termasuk entiti yang telah ditubuhkan dan hanya wujud di atas kertas sahaja
4885489 akibat perang dunia ke 2 as telah berhadapan dengan ancaman terhadap pakatan demokrasi dan tanpa sebarang mekanisme untuk menyalurkan bantuan politik penggubal dasar as telah menggunakan cara tersembunyi dengan menghantar penasihat peralatan dan bantuan kewangan untuk menaja akhbar dan parti parti yang berada dalam kekangan di eropah
4885490 untuk menyediakan ruang kepada tindakan ketenteraan kami telah menaja dan menyalurkan kuasa kepada organisasi yang menjadi peneraju di dalam masyarakat awam dan juga media ini adalah versi yang diperbaharui dalam rampasan kuasa di brazil
4885491 untuk menaja pertarungan idea ini pentadbiran johnson telah mencadangkan penubuhan mekanisma awam persendirian untuk menaja aktiviti luar negara secara terbuka
4885492 untuk menentukan bagaimana as boleh memberikan sumbangan terbaik kepada kempen global untuk demokrasi
4885493 kerjasama erat bersama dengan usaha dasar luar diplomatik ekonomi ketenteraan termasuk hubungan erat dengan sektor masyarakat amerika buruh perniagaan universiti dermawan parti politik akhbar
4885494 program ini tidak akan disembunyikan di dalam bayang bayang program ini dengan megah akan berdiri di bawah lampu yang terang dan sudah tentu ianya akan selari dengan kepentingan negara kita
4885495 rujuk kepada maksud bukan kerajaan ini membantu dalam mengekalkan kredibiliti di seluruh dunia di mana ini tidak terdapat dalam agensi kerajaan as
4885496 ned mewarisi program demokrasi ronald reagan dan telah menyediakan pembiayaan kepada banyak kumpulan latin amerika termasuk canf diyakinkan bahawa jalan menuju ke arah kemerdekaan cuba bergantung kepada nicaragua jawatankuasa canf komited terhadap perjuangan anti sandinista
4885497 kerjasama ini bermula apabila theodore shackley bekas timbalan pengarah operasi dan ketua bahagian operasi sulit meminta ahli yayasan tersebut menyokong dasar amerika tengah
4885498 kempen menentang kejahatan untuk hak asasi dan demokrasi dimana ia mengelakkan tuduhan imperialisma dengan menggambarkan dirinya sebagai satu tindakbalas kepada keperluan penentangan dan perubahan seluruh dunia
4885499 campur tangan dalam pilihanraya sangat penting kepada objektif dasar luar as
4885500 berbanding tindakan secara diam dan perlakuan agresif secara terbuka dimana secara kebiasaannya digunakan oleh cia untuk melakasanakan serangan untuk mengkucar kacirkan keadaan bermula pada akhir 1940 an sehingga pertengahan 1970 an bentuk manipulasi pilihanraya sekarang dipimpian secara besar besaran sebagai satu pandangan putarbelit yang indah dan drama moral
4885501 terdapat satu operasi rahsia menentang revolusi bolivaria ianya bermula di bawah presiden clinton dan diperhebatkan dibawah george bush jr ianya seperti kempen menentang sandinistas tetapi setakat ini tanpa keganasan atau sekatan ekonomi menggalakkan demokrasi memantau pilihanraya dan membantu kehidupan masyarakat
4885502 untuk menambahkan sebanyak dua kali ganda perbelanjaan untuk national endowment for democracy dan memfokuskan kepada usaha terbaru dalam memajukan pilihanraya yang bebas dan pasaran bebas media bebas dan kesatuan buruh yang bebas di timur tengah
4885503 untuk mewujudkan dan memperkuatkan hubungan perniagaan di dalam afghanistan untuk memastikan langkah yang lebih kukuh dan pelbagai dalam membina demokrasi dan ekonomi pasaran

4885506 membawa bersama had yang lebih luas untuk pakar media dengan objektif untuk memperkukuhkan sokongan terhadap media yang bebas ke seluruh dunia
4885507 as tidak berkemampuan untuk menafikan satu instrument yang berkesan untuk dasar luarnya apabila kepentingan dan nilai amerika dipertahankan daripada serangan idealogi daripada pelbagai jenis kuasa anti demokratik di seluruh dunia mereka masih diancam dengan hebat oleh regim komunis yang masih kukuh neo komunis pemerintahan dictator yang agresif nasionalis yang radikal dan pelampau islam berdsarkan reality ini as tidak boleh mengaku kalah dalam perang idealogi inikepada musuh masyarakat yang bebas dan terbuka
4885508 apa yang telah dilakukan adalah untuk menukar banyak perkara dahsyat yang dilakukan oleh cia kepada organisasi baru dengan nama yang baik kewujudan ned adalah sesuatu yang sangat hebat untuk politik hubungan awam dan sinis

4885514 i think islamic schools will make them better prepared to be leaders
4885515 after attending this school for only two years my son tests several grades above the state average and can recite far more surahs of the quran than i can
4885516 with the added benefit of having a proud sense of his muslim identity
4885517 interact in a pluralistic gender mixed and muslim minority society
4885518 a large number of muslim parents are highly educated professionals who place a great value on education
4885519 the fact that public schools in many areas in the united states are struggling with issues of violence drugs and premarital sex keep parents very concerned
4885520 in the last 20 years muslims realized our children are losing their identity
4885521 its no longer like the past where the islamic school is struggling
4885522 nowadays with both parents working the time to teach islam to the kids is not available
4885523 right now the message is you fit in as a muslim

4885527 while the hong kong government has emphasized a policy of laissez faire the singaporean government has since the early 1960s pursued the accumulation of physical capital via forced national saving and the solicitation of a veritable deluge of foreign investment
4885528 singapore is a victim of its own targeting policies which are increasingly driving the economy ahead of its learning maturity into the production of goods in which it has lower and lower productivity
4885529 has had one of the most rapid rates of intra manufacturing structural change in the world economy
4885530 singapore had one of the lowest returns to physical capital in the world the days in which singapore can continue to sustain accumulation driven growth are clearly numbered
4885531 he had refused to renounce violence as a political instrument

4885534 if a girl could be at a party for 30 minutes without getting a man to talk to her she might just as well go on home and shoot herself
4885535 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4885536 this is a serious matter that should be thoroughly investigated and we are sending a letter to homeland security secretary michael chertoff asking for an investigation
4885537 while ice is conducting its own internal investigation homeland security has jurisdiction and we want someone with oversight to take a hard look at this
4885538 the conduct of ice agents guards medical staff and other employees
4885539 its clearly a violation of human rights we believe that its a criminal act to deny someone medical care and cause their death like that
4885540 ice may think they can get away with this all around the country but no not in rhode island
4885541 this is our state and ice is not going to torture people here we want our congressional representatives our u s attorney and our state attorney general to be with us in the statement that no criminal outrageous sadistic violence against a human being is permitted in rhode island
4885542 of systematic and routine denial of medical care for people who have preventable documented medical problems
4885543 takes great care to ensure the safety and well being of each of the individuals who come through our detention facilities each year
4885544 specific allegations that have been raised that mr ng was mistreated by officers while in custody of the wyatt detention facility
4885545 came as the direct result of medical care and special diagnostic evaluation recommended by the facilitys medical staff
4885546 will point out the facts that are already available to what happened to mr ng and express concern about the comments that have thus far been made by the wyatt facility

4885550 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4885551 for mexico the greatest worry we have in these times like we have never had before in our history is the organized crime problem
4885552 but we have to make a binational effort an international effort because the movement of drugs the drug market the finances along the length and breadth of the continent goes from south america to mexico to the united states
4885553 if you dont have inside information or intelligence to begin to see who is directing this activity all youre going to do is wind up arresting one person here one person there
4885554 i also know it doesnt happen in a month the cases we built over time took years
4885555 while ieds explode gi gives toys to scared iraqi children
4885556 we will see you sometime after sunset and before dawn if we feel like it and then only maybe
4885557 you like this cloth my friend for you 50 no 35
4885558 whether iraq emerges as a light in the darkness of the middle east or falls into utter chaos it again has no bearing
4885559 today in iraq the children need a great many things and i call upon the current students and alumni ae of my alma mater to help me in this endeavor
4885560 for many liberated children during world war ii their first memory of freedom was a hershey chocolate bar from an american soldier
4885561 the outcome of this war is far from determined and i relish the chance that in 60 years an elderly iraqi persons first image of freedom was a coloring book a backpack or box of crayons from an american soldier
4885562 id already seen the wondrous bewilderment in the childrens eyes when we let them try on our sunglasses or have some bubble gum nothing prepared me for when we distributed backpacks to each child filled with desperately needed school supplies
4885563 i can bear witness to the volume of home baked cookies phone cards and supplies mailed to our fighting men
4885564 cannot accept money as theres neither staples nor office depot in iraq
4885565 why would a guy stationed in korea for the next two years need desert training
4885566 hmmm no good water source no real food no view to speak of i think i will put my house right here and enjoy this 130 degree heat
4885567 ive got a tent a sleeping bag and a 9mm things will look up in the morning
4885568 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4885569 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4885570 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4885571 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4885572 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4885573 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4885574 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4885575 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4885576 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4885577 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4885578 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4885579 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4885580 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4885581 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4885582 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4885583 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4885584 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4885585 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4885586 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4885587 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4885588 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4885589 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4885590 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4885594 it is a fact that certain principles like the tender years doctrine which presuppose that it is in the childs best interests to be with the mother are now being challenged
4885595 it depends upon how old the child is and whats the nature of the mothers work
4885596 if say the child is above nine and the mother works in a call centre how does she take care of him her so you bring in the grandparents as long as the mother has visitation rights its only fair
4885597 judgements have earlier said that the fact that a mother is working can never be a ground to deprive her of child custody at the same time courts wont give her custody when she is not economically independent now you say she cant keep the child because she is working you cant damn a mother both ways
4885598 does it mean that all single mothers should give away their children its unfortunate that so many court cases these days are retrogressive
4885599 there is the patriarchal notion that a child belongs to his fathers family again the child may have been living in a joint family set up with grandparents who are also caregivers until the breakup of his her parents marriage
4885600 mothers often have softer jobs so the child may not get the financial comforts that the father could provide
4885601 the court does not go beyond the fact that this is what the child wants in many circumstances the court may not realise the commercial reason behind the childs preference
4885602 it shocks the conscience but todays children especially 9 14 year olds are becoming creatures of not love but of comfort

4885625 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4885626 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4885627 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4885628 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4885629 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4885630 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4885631 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4885632 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4885633 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4885634 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4885635 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4885636 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4885637 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4885638 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4885639 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

4885643 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract
4885644 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the united states from engaging in business dealings with iranian nationals

4885650 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4885651 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4885652 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4885653 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects

4885655 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4885656 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4885657 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4885658 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4885659 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4885660 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4885661 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4885662 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4885663 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4885664 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4885665 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4885666 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4885667 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4885668 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4885669 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4885670 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4885671 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4885672 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4885673 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4885674 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4885675 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4885676 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4885677 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4885678 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4885679 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4885680 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4885681 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4885682 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4885683 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4885684 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4885685 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4885686 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4885687 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4885688 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4885689 who are open to doing something on the production side
4885690 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4885691 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4885692 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4885693 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4885694 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4885695 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4885696 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4885697 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

4885713 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
4885714 india are looking to have uranium for clean energy purposes by 2050 35 per cent of all of their power needs could be met by nuclear energy and that would save an enormous amount in terms of greenhouse gasses
4885715 it is the one policy thing that prime minister kevin rudd could do which would have more impact than anything else in australia to lower global greenhouse gas emissions
4885716 we must maintain our relations build our relations with other major countries such as india and the selling of uranium is one way of doing that

4885723 the peoples of central mindanao are laden with the heavy yoke of unstable peace and order condition and man made calamities from which they have not fully recovered yet the present hostilities certainly are a hard blow to the already weakened people thus we call on the civic religious and all peace oriented organizations to evaluate objectively the situation in order to appropriately address the issues

4885845 its unethical for government to be the banker accountant and collection agent for political special interests
4885846 government should be using our tax dollars and our civil servants time to provide crucial public services not to funnel money to political organizations

4885850 of course this game will be fun as this thing gets rolling the newness wears off and it gets down to playing im excited i really like the guys im excited about it not only for this week but in the future
4885851 whenever not only eric and schotty offensive coordinator brian schottenheimer feel its ok
4885852 i think the smart thing to do is just get your feet wet try to get something going like i always said in preseason youd love to win the game but there are other things
4885853 from a preseason standpoint if i go 6 for 6 great if i go 0 for 6 so be it theres no substitute for a game you can do it all you want in practice but theres no substitute
4885854 ive done with that with lg alan faneca and rt damien woody
4885855 really its not a function of drawing up a ton of new plays
4885856 hes picking up everything that were asking him to do
4885857 theres going to be plays hes comfortable with and plays maybe that hes not comfortable with its going to be based on each week
4885858 most of the plays that we are running are plays that he has run before
4885859 hes done a really good job with something that is not easy and im proud of him
4885860 the big thing with brett is obviously he pressures the whole field hes been doing that his whole career
4885861 we tell our guys all the time that sometimes you have a route thats maybe designated to clear the defense to take a safety out of position or something and bretts just got such a great feel that if he sees something maybe its a safety biting down on something hell throw the ball
4885862 so you say you were one of the best at
4885863 i was pretty good myself back in the day too bad theres no way to prove such a claim
4885864 that all enjoyment spontaneously overflows into praise unless sometimes even if shyness or the fear of boring others i deliberately brought in to check it the world rings with praise lovers praising their mistresses readers their favourite poet walkers praising the countryside players praising their favourite game praise of weather wines dishes actors motors horses colleges countries historical figures children flowers mountains rare stamps rare beetles sometimes even politicians or scholars i has not noticed how the humblest and most capacious minds praised most i had not noticed either that just as persons spontaneously praise what they value so they spontaneously urge us to join them in praising it isnt she lovely wasnt it glorious dont you think thats magnificent the psalmists in telling everyone to praise god are doing what we all do when we speak of what we care about
4885865 but when you pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking
4885866 lord that lady who gestured rudely to me in my car today i pray that you would slap her silly with your scorching judgment teach her not to treat your children that way with a scathing rebuke from on high amen
4885867 but sir you can see in my bag i have no additional lenses its just the camera

4885871 are you sure because i mean you can just have it free im not asking for money
4885872 and on the other hand it is necessary to establish long term cooperation agreements with the countries of origin of immigrants and lets not forget the humanitarian factor immigrants should be treated with dignity 1
4885873 we are very happy to have the aircraft back and having a resource that is going to be available to support our ground crews during the upcoming fire season
4885874 i think that with the current prevailing condition there is a likelihood that theyll be used
4885875 obviously as part of the resources or a tool in the box that the firefighters on the ground have one of the options will be to use the aircraft
4885876 even if evidence does not link iraq directly to the 9 11 attack
4885877 when you are in that position both as a member of parliament and as a potential environment minister you have to be completely scrupulous in the way you behave
4885878 three huge new projects new metro rail fiona stanley hospital and perth arena are all being built debt free using the surplus thats what we do with the surplus we invest it so that west australians can have the facilities and the prosperity that they deserve in the future
4885879 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4885880 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4885881 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4885882 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4885883 so i think the public have got a right to expect that when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well

4885886 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
4885887 india are looking to have uranium for clean energy purposes by 2050 35 per cent of all of their power needs could be met by nuclear energy and that would save an enormous amount in terms of greenhouse gasses
4885888 it is the one policy thing that prime minister kevin rudd could do which would have more impact than anything else in australia to lower global greenhouse gas emissions
4885889 we must maintain our relations build our relations with other major countries such as india and the selling of uranium is one way of doing that
4885890 what im trying to do is stake out what i call the common ground for the common good
4885891 i think there are a lot of americans who are disaffected by both the left and the right whether its the secular left or the religious left or whether its the secular right or religious right
4885892 this is a critical time for our nation and the american people deserve to hear both candidates speak from the heart without interruption in a civil and thoughtful format absent the partisan gotcha questions that typically produce heat instead of light

4885903 a os atr s abandon una congregaci n luego de pasar por algunas experiencias poco positivas y sinti ndome herido por varias situaciones que ocurrieron quien sino dios conoce si las cosas sucedieron como yo las percib pero s que me retir lami ndome algunas heridas comenc a visitar algunas iglesias poco tiempo despu s sabiendo que no necesitaba moverme en las m as necesitaba una iglesia familia encontr una iglesia donde sent que el se or se estaba moviendo sent que era el lugar donde dios me estaba guiando pero a n no me sent a muy excitado al respecto
4885904 durante ese tiempo finales de los 80 y comienzos de los 90 el se or utiliz una serie de conferencias llamadas atrapa el fuego para hacer esto agitar en la gente una nueva pasi n por l la gente estaba excitada algunas personas llegaban a pintarse sus caras como en la pel cula coraz n valiente comprende la idea
4885905 algunos de mis amigos hab an participado de las reuniones de atrapa el fuego y realmente estaban excitados acerca de ellas por eso decid asistir a una de estas conferencias en dallas con un grupo de amigos de houston recib ense anzas hermosas y ungidas pude ver a la gente tocada poderosamente por el se or amaba lo que estaba viendo pero me costaba mucho entrar en ello
4885906 un d a durante un momento en el cual el esp ritu del se or cay poderosamente sobre la multitud el se or me mostr una imagen de una llama muy peque a y me dijo que
4885907 en caso que usted sea demasiado joven como para conocer s lo a los hornos el ctricos perm tame explicarle acerca de los pilotos y los hornos a gas el piloto es una peque a llama que est permanentemente encendida lista para encender el flujo de gas cuando se suelte cuando el gas fluye alcanza el piloto y se enciende resuena como un soplido y el horno o la estufa se encienden sin embargo si el piloto est apagado o su llama es m nima no enciende el gas y no saldr ninguna llama hacia el resto del mecanismo en otras palabras no sucede nada
4885908 le agradezco a dios por habernos colocado dentro de un cuerpo de creyentes porque recuerdo lo bien que me sent cuando mis amigos impusieron sus manos y oraron por mi restauraci n aquel d a
4885909 david se anim a s mismo en el se or nunca supe exactamente lo que eso signific para l pero s que necesitamos alentarnos en l cuando regres a houston supe que no deb a quedarme s lo necesitaba desarrollar la comuni n para mantener una llama poderosa el aislamiento puede apagar las cosas para m y pienso que tambi n es as con todos nosotros supe que necesitaba alentarme a m mismo al ser usado por l porque cuando no era as mi llama se debilitaba para m esa llama se fortalece cuando soy necesario y conociendo que estoy ayudando a marcar una diferencia
4885910 estamos en tiempos desafiantes los rumores de la econom a son desquiciantes el terreno pol tico est lleno de murmuraciones el crimen va en aumento y los patrones clim ticos se desordenaron ser a f cil sentirse desalentado si no tenemos cuidado
4885911 c mo restauramos nuestra pasi n cuando nuestros pilotos est n demasiado bajos bien al principio tuve que pedirles ayuda a otros no fue f cil decir que necesitaba ayuda pero me sent a miserablemente ap tico acerca de las cosas que antes me excitaban estoy contento de haberlo hecho tambi n mencion un par de estrategias que mantuvieron la llama de mi piloto encendida ministrar a otros como deb a hacerlo y no aislarme las conferencias y los servicios ungidos de la iglesia ayudaron
4885912 siento que en el cuerpo hay personas que son pilotos que encienden al resto con pasi n y revelaci n esa gente puede marcar una gran diferencia cuando los tiempos son oscuros ciertamente chuck ha sido uno de ellos para mi vida alentarnos entre nosotros nos ayuda a seguir avanzando
4885913 despu s de todo se nos exhorta a alentarnos unos a otros todo lo que podamos mientras el d a se acerca y parece que se est acercando la alabanza y la adoraci n la lectura y la meditaci n todo esto nos devolver el enfoque donde debe estar y no hacia el mundo cambiante que nos rodea debemos enfocarnos en un dios apasionado por su creaci n y apasionado por nosotros
4885914 en todo este tiempo trat de no usar la met fora deje que brille su peque a luz y casi lo logro pero lo estoy haciendo ahora casi al final necesitamos ser luces que brillen en la oscuridad como nunca antes y necesitamos mantenerla en condiciones para que pueda brillar estoy convencido que tendremos xito por el se or para extender nuestra posici n ante el mundo y ofrecerle algo que el mundo no puede dar
4885915 entonces busque al se or si su piloto est bajo y permita que le muestre en qu punto se encuentra que l le muestre el camino para restaurar su pasi n l desea hacerlo y est dispuesto tambi n necesita que todos estemos ansiosos por avanzar en los d as por venir no tema pedir esto

4885952 many countries subscribe to the hague convention and it established a mechanism for solving the difficult and very emotional custody disputes that arise between americans and parents from other countries

4886045 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
4886046 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4886047 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4886102 after the strikeout there was a little light at the end of the tunnel and then erick ran down garkos ball

4886132 i dont have the yellow jersey on and blake does
4886133 and hes obviously riding very well if i dont beat him he deserves to win its not a done deal by any means theres not much to do tomorrow but go all out and see what happens
4886134 you know it will hurt but you dont know who it will be that will be hurting you in a time trial youre the only one hurting yourself on a climb like todays there are so many options a day like today is more like a chess match
4886135 we had jonathan garcia setting tempo just to narrow it down and see who was swinging a little bit
4886136 garmin was controlling but they had peterson in the move and hes a good climber so they werent chasing too hard they werent freaking out if it didnt come back we tried to hurt them a bit on the hills and deal with a harder tempo than maybe they wanted to
4886137 that was the only time all day that i had to close some gaps
4886138 i just dropped back to see what was happening to see how everyone was looking
4886139 i know that descent and i knew it would regroup at the bottom i wanted to see what the composition of the front group was
4886140 it seemed like sevilla slowed down and danielson slowed down nothing to lose nothing to gain really it thinned the field out pretty quick and gave me a head start on the other guys
4886141 the other guys were taking turns making accelerations and i was feeling comfortable and within myself
4886142 i knew i wanted to put more time into anyone i could i wanted to go across to chadwick by myself and i went across and still felt good and just kept going
4886143 i must have gotten dropped eight nine times out there today
4886144 i was getting pretty hard from all sides there chris baldwin and burke swindlehurst were attacking particularly hard at the bottom of the climb i didnt have the acceleration to go with them when caldwell bounced straight across to chadwick i thought well okay that guy deserves to win hes riding so well but i just found my own tempo and kept turning it up
4886145 ive ridden this enough times this year to know where the landmarks are and where i can get the best out of myself
4886146 once i got to the final crux before it flattens out from eight percent to six percent i knew that if i could get a gap i could get it rolling once i had a nice gap i set my sights on caldwell once i caught him i went for the line all the way i knew i could go 500 meters all out
4886147 i held a good steady pace the whole way but louder came across and had a little more gas in the last kilometer
4886148 i was feeling alright with 500 meters to go but he put in a strong dig there and opened up a gap
4886149 i feel it already im looking forward to it i know i have some good time trials in me and the added motivation of paying back my teammates for all the hard work they did for me today
4886150 i would like to apologize to you for assuming that your private assurances to me regarding your desire to cooperate in our efforts to negotiate bipartisan lobbying reform were sincere

4886152 no not the green party it is really important to stop mccain
4886153 but we just need a chance to get on the ballot
4886154 i tell you the truth you want to be with me because i fed you not because you understood the miraculous signs
4886155 but dont be so concerned about perishable things like food spend your energy seeking the eternal life that the son of man can give you for god the father has given me the seal of his approval

4886165 i applaud your intelligent and well formatted statement keep up the great blogging oh and i think pigeons kick ass

4886177 thanks again for keeping us all up to date on popular culture
4886178 you seriously have to be the funniest pigeon ive ever seen flying feathers mad pigeon rules the coop
4886179 just in case i havent mentioned it i think you are bloody brilliant i love your site and i really love your take on things even when i may not agree
4886180 you have a cockswinging irreverence for academic formality yet backed up your topic with solid analytical methodology
4886181 way to go pidge for highlighting such a riproaring exchange of opinion

4886184 we are winning and our troops will come home with honor and victory and not in defeat
4886185 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million
4886186 i hate hate hate it when they put multiple links in single words
4886187 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4886188 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4886189 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4886190 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4886191 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4886192 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4886193 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4886194 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4886195 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4886196 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4886197 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4886198 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4886199 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4886200 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4886201 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4886202 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4886203 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4886204 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4886205 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4886206 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4886207 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4886208 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4886209 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4886210 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4886211 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4886212 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4886213 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4886214 bahwa pelaku ekonomi sektor non formal semacam kakil ima telah membuat negeri kita bertahan dari hempasan krisis multi dimensi
4886215 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4886216 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4886217 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4886218 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4886219 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4886220 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4886221 this is a planning took where all things are going
4886222 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4886223 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4886224 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4886225 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4886226 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4886227 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4886228 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4886229 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4886230 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4886231 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4886232 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4886233 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4886234 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4886235 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4886236 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4886237 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4886238 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4886239 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4886240 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4886241 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4886242 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4886243 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4886244 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4886245 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4886246 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4886247 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4886248 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4886249 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4886250 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4886251 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4886252 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4886253 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4886254 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4886255 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4886256 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4886257 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4886258 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4886259 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4886260 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4886261 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4886262 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4886263 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4886264 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4886265 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4886266 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4886267 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4886268 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4886269 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4886270 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4886271 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4886272 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4886273 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4886274 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4886275 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4886276 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4886277 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4886278 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4886279 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4886280 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4886281 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4886282 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4886283 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4886284 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4886285 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4886286 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4886287 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4886288 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4886289 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4886290 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4886291 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4886292 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
4886293 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
4886294 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
4886295 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law
4886296 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4886297 he obama seems to have the answers this is the new testament
4886298 this issue of whistleblower is about whats at the heart of barack obama
4886299 obama is a man who reflexively instinctively will side with whats wrong and harmful for america and will oppose whats right and good and wholesome for america its uncanny but this profoundly negative orientation is sugar coated with a charismatic positive persona and beguiling rhetoric
4886300 using the sermon on the mount to defend gay rights
4886301 this issue of whistleblower on barack obama is must reading
4886302 just like the upcoming may and june issues which will focus in depth on hillary clinton and john mccain

4886320 demi tuhan nabi ibrahim nabi ismail nabi ishaq dan nabi ya
4886321 jika engkau menaikiku berarti tidak mematuhi perintah ibunya sesungguhnya engkau tidak akan dapat menguasaiku selamanya maka berjalanlah engkau karena sesungguhnya andaikan engkau memerintahkan sebuah gunung berjalan sendiri untuk engkau naiki niscaya gunung itu akan menurut semata mata baktimu kepada ibumu

4886324 ambillah enam dinar ini dan usahlah engkau meminta persetujuan ibumu
4886325 bahkan andai engkau memberiku emas seberat lembu ini takkan kuterima kecuali dengan keridhaan ibuku
4886326 kembalilah engkau ke pasar dan juallah lembu itu dengan enam dinar atas keridhaanku
4886327 ibuku memerintahkan aku agar menjual lembu ini tidak kuran gdari enam dinar
4886328 aku akan memberimu 12 dinar tak usahlah kamu meminta persetujuan ibumu
4886329 sesungguhnya orang yagn datang kepadamu itu adalah malaikat ia menjelma dalam bentuk manusia untuk mengujimu untuk itu jika ia kembali kepadamu tanyakanlah apakah engkau mengizinkan aku menjual lembu ini atau tidak
4886330 pulanglah engkau dan katakanlah pada ibumu agar merawat lembu ini baik baik
4886331 imran akan membeli lembu darimu karena ada seseorang yang amti terbunuh dari kaum bani iuntuk itu jangan engkau jual kecuali dengan uang dinar seberat lembumu itu

4886333 oregon voters deserve to be heard on this referendum more than enough oregonians signed the petitions for it the people didnt thwart this effort government bureaucracy did that is a dangerous precedent for the future of the democratic process in america
4886334 although regulations on the referendum process implicate the fundamental right to vote the states important interests justify the minimal burden on plaintiffs rights
4886335 no county gave notice to voters with rejected signatures the counties also refused to consider extrinsic evidence presented by voters
4886336 oregons important interests justify this minimal burden on the right to vote

4886341 these advancements in our partys binding document are thanks to the work and input of lgbt delegates senator obama and his campaign lgbt advocates and stonewall democrats across the country
4886342 democrats will fight to end discrimination based on race sex ethnicity national origin language religion sexual orientation gender identity age and disability in every corner of our country because thats the america we believe in
4886343 we support the full inclusion of all families in the life of our nation and support equal responsibility benefits and protections

4886349 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4886350 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4886351 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4886352 he cavic said it would be good for the sport of swimming and good for me if i lost thats what he was quoted as so when bob told me that i was pretty fired up
4886353 when someone does say something it makes me more excited and more ready to go so i guess i thank him for that

4886357 it was just a great race to be part of an absolute spectacle

4886366 with you it was behaviorist psychology and moral reevaluations with me i had an awful time when i got mixed up in geology five billion years to make the world it was only when i got a grasp of eternity that i began to see how he is in no sense controlled by time
4886367 evolution means that when we encounter something in nature that is complicated or mysterious we dont have to shrug our shoulders in bewilderment instead we can ask how it got to be that way and if at first it seems so complicated that the evolutionary steps are hard to work out we have an invitation to imagine to play to experiment and explore
4886368 and there is that leviathan which you have made for the sport of it

4886370 sit here and let me tell you about those young boys he is going to try and kiss you you are going to like that but dont let him do that he is going to try and feel your breast you are going to like that but dont let him do that but most important he is going to try and get on top of you to have his way with you you are going to like that but dont let him do that it will disgrace the family
4886371 i think they are more challenged today because of all the choice and the short window when they get the spotlight
4886372 youd almost say the olympics is an event beyond sports
4886373 the companies have to make sure that being associated with the olympics is going to help them ring their cash registers
4886374 if michael phelps swims for an eighth gold medal the tv ratings are going to be through the roof
4886375 the price has gotten so high that these decisions go all the way at least to ceo level executives if not to the board
4886376 if youre looking at the olympics in terms of these monster ratings and the stories that are coming out its a pretty attractive place to be
4886377 i think youre going to read probably about some more renewals before these games are over
4886378 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4886379 from the initial checkup i say that none of the babies have any sort of deformities or incomplete organs
4886380 we thought about an abortion but then we felt its religiously forbidden
4886381 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
4886382 india are looking to have uranium for clean energy purposes by 2050 35 per cent of all of their power needs could be met by nuclear energy and that would save an enormous amount in terms of greenhouse gasses
4886383 it is the one policy thing that prime minister kevin rudd could do which would have more impact than anything else in australia to lower global greenhouse gas emissions
4886384 we must maintain our relations build our relations with other major countries such as india and the selling of uranium is one way of doing that
4886385 i had a difficult youth i experimented with drugs and drank i trace this to a certain selfishness on my point i couldnt focus on other people
4886386 i think after 9 11 my friends we should have told americans to join the peace corps expand the military serve a cause greater than your self interest
4886387 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew whatever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me
4886388 i dont think he was a strong enough jurist or a legal thinker at the time for that i profoundly disagree with his interpretation of the constitution
4886389 on this particular issue if you believe that life begins at conception and you are consistent then i cant argue with you on that
4886390 what i can do is say are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies
4886391 for me as a christian it is a sacred union gods in the mix
4886392 i can afford those civil rights to others even if i dont have that view
4886393 if we pretend like everything is free we are betraying the tradition of america
4886394 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4886395 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
4886396 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
4886397 i am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows the iraq war is largely about oil
4886398 from the strictly economic point of view tourism is becoming a very important and profitable activity in argentina the country is welcoming about 4 million visitors a year and tango is one of the causes of that phenomenon
4886399 the slow decadence almost disappearance of tango in the middle 90s

4886404 todd bentleys failure of the flesh i am going to be honest it is more than just a separation theres other things involved youre going to be hearing some of the failure of todd bentley in this hour
4886405 among those who jumped on the lakeland bandwagon discernment was discouraged

4886418 lev ntate brilla e irradia estoy llenando los l mites de mi herencia con gloria oir s un nuevo llamado estoy revelando algunos lugares donde mi herencia no est llena de gloria y donde operan maldiciones para ensanchar tu esfera debo ocupar esos lugares la desidia postergar las cosas no hacer las cosas en mi tiempo es una gran competencia para mis prop sitos porque compite con la prosperidad que tengo para ti en los d as por venir
4886419 la enfermedad trabaja en contra de la fuerza de mi pueblo lev ntense despierten el amanecer sac danse las obras de maldad metan las manos en el terreno y avancen en el campo que estoy estableciendo delante de ustedes se despierta en ti una nueva pasi n lev ntate y despi rtate a mi pasi n y fortaleza
4886420 a os atr s abandon una congregaci n luego de pasar por algunas experiencias poco positivas y sinti ndome herido por varias situaciones que ocurrieron quien sino dios conoce si las cosas sucedieron como yo las percib pero s que me retir lami ndome algunas heridas comenc a visitar algunas iglesias poco tiempo despu s sabiendo que no necesitaba moverme en las m as necesitaba una iglesia familia encontr una iglesia donde sent que el se or se estaba moviendo sent que era el lugar donde dios me estaba guiando pero a n no me sent a muy excitado al respecto
4886421 durante ese tiempo finales de los 80 y comienzos de los 90 el se or utiliz una serie de conferencias llamadas atrapa el fuego para hacer esto agitar en la gente una nueva pasi n por l la gente estaba excitada algunas personas llegaban a pintarse sus caras como en la pel cula coraz n valiente comprende la idea
4886422 algunos de mis amigos hab an participado de las reuniones de atrapa el fuego y realmente estaban excitados acerca de ellas por eso decid asistir a una de estas conferencias en dallas con un grupo de amigos de houston recib ense anzas hermosas y ungidas pude ver a la gente tocada poderosamente por el se or amaba lo que estaba viendo pero me costaba mucho entrar en ello
4886423 un d a durante un momento en el cual el esp ritu del se or cay poderosamente sobre la multitud el se or me mostr una imagen de una llama muy peque a y me dijo que
4886424 en caso que usted sea demasiado joven como para conocer s lo a los hornos el ctricos perm tame explicarle acerca de los pilotos y los hornos a gas el piloto es una peque a llama que est permanentemente encendida lista para encender el flujo de gas cuando se suelte cuando el gas fluye alcanza el piloto y se enciende resuena como un soplido y el horno o la estufa se encienden sin embargo si el piloto est apagado o su llama es m nima no enciende el gas y no saldr ninguna llama hacia el resto del mecanismo en otras palabras no sucede nada
4886425 le agradezco a dios por habernos colocado dentro de un cuerpo de creyentes porque recuerdo lo bien que me sent cuando mis amigos impusieron sus manos y oraron por mi restauraci n aquel d a
4886426 david se anim a s mismo en el se or nunca supe exactamente lo que eso signific para l pero s que necesitamos alentarnos en l cuando regres a houston supe que no deb a quedarme s lo necesitaba desarrollar la comuni n para mantener una llama poderosa el aislamiento puede apagar las cosas para m y pienso que tambi n es as con todos nosotros supe que necesitaba alentarme a m mismo al ser usado por l porque cuando no era as mi llama se debilitaba para m esa llama se fortalece cuando soy necesario y conociendo que estoy ayudando a marcar una diferencia
4886427 estamos en tiempos desafiantes los rumores de la econom a son desquiciantes el terreno pol tico est lleno de murmuraciones el crimen va en aumento y los patrones clim ticos se desordenaron ser a f cil sentirse desalentado si no tenemos cuidado
4886428 c mo restauramos nuestra pasi n cuando nuestros pilotos est n demasiado bajos bien al principio tuve que pedirles ayuda a otros no fue f cil decir que necesitaba ayuda pero me sent a miserablemente ap tico acerca de las cosas que antes me excitaban estoy contento de haberlo hecho tambi n mencion un par de estrategias que mantuvieron la llama de mi piloto encendida ministrar a otros como deb a hacerlo y no aislarme las conferencias y los servicios ungidos de la iglesia ayudaron
4886429 siento que en el cuerpo hay personas que son pilotos que encienden al resto con pasi n y revelaci n esa gente puede marcar una gran diferencia cuando los tiempos son oscuros ciertamente chuck ha sido uno de ellos para mi vida alentarnos entre nosotros nos ayuda a seguir avanzando
4886430 despu s de todo se nos exhorta a alentarnos unos a otros todo lo que podamos mientras el d a se acerca y parece que se est acercando la alabanza y la adoraci n la lectura y la meditaci n todo esto nos devolver el enfoque donde debe estar y no hacia el mundo cambiante que nos rodea debemos enfocarnos en un dios apasionado por su creaci n y apasionado por nosotros
4886431 en todo este tiempo trat de no usar la met fora deje que brille su peque a luz y casi lo logro pero lo estoy haciendo ahora casi al final necesitamos ser luces que brillen en la oscuridad como nunca antes y necesitamos mantenerla en condiciones para que pueda brillar estoy convencido que tendremos xito por el se or para extender nuestra posici n ante el mundo y ofrecerle algo que el mundo no puede dar
4886432 entonces busque al se or si su piloto est bajo y permita que le muestre en qu punto se encuentra que l le muestre el camino para restaurar su pasi n l desea hacerlo y est dispuesto tambi n necesita que todos estemos ansiosos por avanzar en los d as por venir no tema pedir esto
4886433 mi coraz n est expectante dios cantar y te alabar despierta mi gloria como el arpa y el la d despierta mi gloria

4886445 we are supportive of ms spears during this difficult time
4886446 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4886447 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4886448 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4886449 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4886450 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4886451 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4886452 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4886453 all i can do is be me whoever that is

4886457 american consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed rate mortgage the traditional fixed rate mortgage may be an expensive method of financing a home
4886458 well my personal impression is that most of those borrowers were gamblers very willing to suspend disbelief and very rationally running a large risk of default
4886459 but i do know that lumping all holders of risky mortgages together on the basis of some simplistic ethical perspective isnt right
4886460 i dont see the problem as a result of easy money instead some of the participants didnt understand how risk had been invisibly shifted all hidden by bubble appreciation
4886461 the only real oddity here is that the millionaires took financial advantage of the biillionaires the smart guys not understanding that the risk had been shifted their way

4886509 how can we justify selling the uranium to china and to russia in an unfettered way and yet we dont sell uranium to india
4886510 india are looking to have uranium for clean energy purposes by 2050 35 per cent of all of their power needs could be met by nuclear energy and that would save an enormous amount in terms of greenhouse gasses
4886511 it is the one policy thing that prime minister kevin rudd could do which would have more impact than anything else in australia to lower global greenhouse gas emissions
4886512 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
4886513 were you really doing a project for school when he went to your house that one time
4886514 fewer than 3 500 4 000 tigers are estimated to remain in the wild in asia the only region of the world where they exist
4886515 has seriously impacted not only the chinese traditional culture but also the medicinal treatment and health care of the chinese people in particular those in poverty
4886516 as a leader in promoting the conservation of tigers the united states has a responsibility to effectively manage its captive tiger population to prevent any emergence of illegal trade
4886517 any supply of tiger parts into the black market can stimulate trade and consumer demand which could pose a serious threat to already dwindling wild tiger populations
4886518 you people cant exist its impossible nobody can help me you cant be talking to me how can you be talking to me
4886519 weve got to be able to do something for the garys of the world

4886521 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4886522 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved

4886539 well there will be an extra art fee to swap out that head but if you both love the images and youre purchasing a wall portrait its well worth the charge
4886540 oh it will be perfect we could hang it in the dining room across from the china cabinet
4886541 sure this is down and dirty but it will give you an idea
4886542 of course our imaging artists will make it look 100 percent natural no one will know this isnt the original image
4886543 lets look at this size and tell me what you think
4886544 you may even want to see the next size up
4886545 th e theological colossus that guards the entrance to old
4886546 open your bible to deuteronomy and follow me while i read
4886547 moses proclaimed to the israelites all the lord had commanded him concerning them th e lord our god said to us at horeb th en as the lord our god commanded us when the lord heard what you said he was angry and solemnly swore because of you the lord became angry with me also and said but the lord said to me
4886548 you see chris thats only the first chapter of deuteronomy and
4886549 contemplate the very term word th e acts of creation themselves
4886550 in your soul you have sensed what the words really are and are really about youre afraid to see god youre afraid to know him th ats why youre stuck in your journey you arent the fi rst but you have this few who read these words have any understanding of the awesome presence in which they stand you have felt the fi re and seen the cloud dont turn back press on
4886551 moses spoke to all israel in the desert east of the jordan that is in the arabah opposite suph between paran and tophel laban hazeroth and dizahab
4886552 moses proclaimed to the israelites all that the lord had commanded him concerning them
4886553 th e technical term for what youve found chris is a chiasm its a concentric structure of music or text that can operate on any level from the few verses you are studying to the book of deuteronomy or the bible as a whole you can see the logic of it in an english translation th e poetry and music only come through fully in the hebrew th e liturgical churches understand intuitively at least something of this more than my own evangelical tradition truth and goodness are communicated through beauty th e music and poetry of it awaken our sensitivity to meaning th e holy spirit is not a hack writer i think youre ready to go on
4886554 why does god insert verse two in here hal th e reference to the eleven days it takes to go from horeb to kadesh barnea seems out of place
4886555 is to contrast the ease of gods way with the difficulty of mans horeb is sinai where the law was given kadesh barnea was the place they were supposed to jump off for the promised land you are about to read that part of the story but the bottom line is that because of their lack of faith it took the israelites thirty eight years to make a trip they could have made in eleven days if they had followed the lords command his yoke is easy and his burden is light keep reading
4886556 you have stayed long enough at this mountain break camp and advance into the hill country of the amorites go to all the neighboring peoples in the arabah in the mountains in the western foothills in the negev and along the coast to the land of the canaanites and to lebanon as far as the great river the euphrates see i have given you this land go in and take possession of the land that the lord swore he would give to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob and to their descendants after them
4886557 how did you feel about education when you graduated from law school
4886558 and what does that have to do with the next three verses you are studying in deuteronomy
4886559 to bring his flock away from the mountain and lead them into acting on the promise i hear it in moses throughout deuteronomy and in paul when he says of himself when i became a man i put childish ways behind me and in the writer of hebrews when he scolds his readers for still living on milk like infants and not being ready for the solid food of maturity most people in the pew spend their life at the foot of the mountain being hearers of the word but not doers i used to plead with god to give me one congregation or one board of elders that could leave the mountain before my ministry was over but he never did th ere were some very deep and committed believers i knew over the years some who moved on spiritually to deeper levels and some who took possession of the promises god had laid out before them but if success in ministry means leading people beyond the elementary level ive been one of gods colossal failures as a servant
4886560 youre not ready to talk about what you think you know
4886561 th e subject of government will come up in the text again and well talk about it then just read the rest of chapter one verses nineteen through forty six and the fi rst verse of chapter two
4886562 you have reached the hill country of the amorites which the lord our god is giving us see the lord your god has given you the land go up and take possession of it as the lord the god of your fathers told you do not be afraid do not be discouraged
4886563 let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to
4886564 it is a good land that the lord our god is giving us
4886565 th e lord hates us so he brought us out of
4886566 do not be terrifi ed do not be afraid of them th e lord your god who is going before you will fi ght for you as he did for you in egypt before your very eyes and in the desert th ere you saw how the lord your god carried you as a father carries his son all the way you went until you reached this place
4886567 not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land i swore to give your forefathers except caleb son of jephunneh he will see it and i will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on because he followed the lord wholeheartedly
4886568 you shall not enter it either but your assistant joshua son of nun will enter it encourage him because he will lead israel to inherit it and the little ones that you said would be taken captive your children who do not yet know good from bad they will enter the land i will give it to them and they will take possession of it but as for you turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the red sea
4886569 we have sinned against the lord we will go up and fight as the lord our god commanded us
4886570 i thought we should discuss this section somewhere that we could get a sense of journeys
4886571 watch the people going by th ink about what the journey is for each one where theyve been where theyre going now tomorrow next week
4886572 are not just travel in space th e journey of israel in this passage is a journey in space and in time like these people around us but more importantly it is the journey of the spiritual experience of the people it covers most of the wanderings before the entry into the land a period of thirty eight years and the experience of a failure of faith th ey have been brought out of the bondage of egypt led through hardship to the edge of plenty and promised success by the creator of the universe yet they refuse to go in blaming their unbelief on gods evil motives toward them although god saved them by bringing them out of egypt they claim he intends to destroy them at the hands of amorites although god loved them and carried them as a father carries his son they claim that he hates them its the psychological phenomenon of projection where a person attributes to another the same feeling that he or she has toward that person
4886573 at every turn they do the opposite of what he asks every time he shows them why they should have faith in him they are unfaithful th en the consequences of their unbelief are brought to them he sends them back toward the desert and tells them they will not see the good land only their children will th is is in eff ect a death sentence to wander in that vast and dreadful desert for the rest of their lives faced with the consequence of their sin they repent and try to make it up by doing what theyre no longer commanded to do a further rebellion and the result is utter failure at every point they act contrary to god and the result is that the blessings are withheld and given to a generation that will accept them
4886574 is written with you the people to whom it is addressed in both the singular and plural th e shift from addressing the individual to the group you occurs throughout the book often within discrete passages since both are translated simply you in english you dont see the difference in english bibles in biblical studies the technical term for this is the numeruswechsel both singular and plural you appear in this passage you dont need to remember the technical term but whats important is that the message is addressed to both the nation and to individuals
4886575 for you chris that means it is addressed to you personally and to every other individual human being but the heir to the israel of moses is not the modern state of israel nor the united states nor any other contemporary nation it is the church in the words of the apostles creed the holy catholic church the church universal the community of believers or at least those who associate together and profess to be believers
4886576 th is sounds like a literal understanding simple enough th e bible tells a story the facts are true and there are lessons to be gained are there other ways of understanding it
4886577 beyond the literal historical sense and the moral or example we can take from that are the allegorical typological and anagogical senses of scripture th ese are not the same but people use the terms somewhat interchangeably and everyone doesnt always mean the same thing when they use them th ey must be used with care
4886578 whole stories or sections of scripture are sometimes seen as symbolic or fi gurative of something else ways of expressing truths about god and humanity stories that dont fi t well with our current human understanding such as the early chapters of genesis or the books of job or jonah are often seen as allegorical a great danger in allegory is that it can lead to fl ights of fancy where the true meaning of the scripture is lost in human imagining and we hear man and not god another danger is that allegorical interpretations become focused on words or worse numbers and fi nd hidden meanings in the text that are supposedly known only to some inner circle th is is the stuff that leads to cults
4886579 th e story of israel is the story of humanity
4886580 god does great things for them and they turn away from him afraid to follow his commands blaming him for their fears in the end they deserve only wilderness wanderings and death
4886581 particular historical events are seen as prefiguring or symbolizing something that comes to full significance in christ th e crossing of the red sea prefigures baptism jonah prefigures the resurrection of christ typology is usually grounded in the scriptures themselves which often make these connections explicit jesus taught that the law of moses as well as the prophets and the psalmists all wrote of him so we are not off base in seeing these connections moses is a type of christ in many respects
4886582 in anagogical interpretation one finds beyond the literal moral allegorical or typological a spiritual and even mystical sense in which the scripture has eternal significance in leading believers to the true homeland th e anagogical sense of scripture is better felt than taught its what comes from the depth of contemplating god in prayer and meditation in light of the scriptures when you understand scripture in an anagogical sense you will have gotten beyond the milk of elementary teachings and will be eating real spiritual meat

4886669 when we obtain any blessing from god it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated
4886670 i the lord am bound when ye do what i say but when ye do not what i say ye have no promise
4886671 shall be a fullness and a continuation of the seeds forever
4886672 how did jesus and john the baptist receive the priesthood
4886673 im going to outline some doctrine that ive found out about the priesthood in a basic view trying to outline the knowledge that ive gleaned this week
4886674 further adam and his posterity were commanded by god to be baptized to receive the holy ghost and to enter into the
4886675 the prophet joseph smith said that adam blessed his posterity because
4886676 how did adam bring his descendants into the presence of the lord today we would say they went to the house of the lord and received their blessings
4886677 sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of god but they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence therefore the lord in his wrath for his anger was kindled against them swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness which rest is the fullness of his glory
4886678 which gospel is the gospel of repentance and of baptism and the remission of sins and the law of carnal commandments
4886679 this priesthood continued down from aaron to john the baptist
4886680 between moses and christ only certain prophets possessed the right to the higher priesthood and the blessings that could bring men into the presence of god one of these prophets was elijah elijah held the keys of the sealing power and did many mighty miracles in his day he had power to seal the heavens raise the dead relieve the drought stricken land and call down fire from heaven he was the last prophet to hold the keys of the priesthood according to the prophet joseph smith he was subsequently translated and taken up into heaven without tasting death he as a translated being restored the keys of this priesthood to the saviors chief apostles peter james and john on the mount of transfiguration
4886681 he was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light
4886682 but within a generation the church was destroyed by a major apostasy and the blessings of the priesthood were removed from the earth
4886683 the melchizedek priesthood holds the right of presidency and has power and authority over all the offices in the church
4886684 it is significant that the first revelation given in 1823 recorded as section 2 of the doctrine and covenants gave this promise about the priesthood
4886685 what priesthood was elijah to reveal john the baptist restored the keys to the aaronic priesthood peter james and john restored the keys of the kingdom of god why send elijah in all the ordinances of the priesthood
4886686 even though the aaronic priesthood and melchizedek priesthood had been restored to the earth the lord urged the saints to build a temple to receive the keys by which this order of priesthood could be administered on the earth again
4886687 if a man gets a fullness of the priesthood of god he has to get it in the same way that jesus christ obtained it and that was by keeping all the commandments and obeying all the ordinances of the house of the lord
4886688 so the kirtland temple in ohio was completed at great sacrifice to the early saints
4886689 committed the keys of the power of turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers that the whole earth may not be smitten with a curse
4886690 bear in mind dear sisters that the eternal blessings which are yours through membership in the church of jesus christ of latter day saints are far far greater than any other blessing you could possibly receive no greater recognition can come to you in this world than to be known as a woman of god no greater status can be conferred upon you than being a daughter of god who experiences true sisterhood wifehood and motherhood or other tasks which influence lives for good
4886691 theres just a quality of life and a kind of person that is attracted to this kind of place
4886692 the kind of person that just can really feel their neighbors pain and really none of us want somebody to hurt we all care about each other
4886693 its really tight knit i know people expect small communities to be like that but maybe culver is even more so than other small towns the kids in culver the one thing i can always count on is how well they take care of each other there is no separation between freshmen and seniors
4886694 the community has gone through these tragic times many have learned to deal with grieving mourning and sorrow i hate to say it but these guys kind of know how to get through the whole process
4886695 it seems like culver has had more than its fair share
4886696 this accident on top of what they just went through
4886697 the best advice i can offer is you cant sweep it under the rug
4886698 or wish it would go away you have to find a way to live with it
4886699 i love my sidekick id but my mom is trying to make me get another she wants me to get the sidekick slide but my daddy wants me to get a lx which one should i get but i love my id so much i mean weve been together a really long time im so attached but it is time to get a new one or should i get another id
4886700 already we are going to be sitting here for 45 minutes
4886701 ma am i am going through the cabin to do my compliance at this time so if you would please be so kind to put your bag under the seat in front of you i would greatly appreciate it
4886702 um why are we not taking off they can take off in this weather we have taken off in this weather before i have to be somewhere
4886703 come on people you dont have to be a rocket scientist to realize that there is bad weather

4886908 it was the same last week we defended poorly and we defended better today saturday but around and inside their box we didnt really look like we would score
4886909 youve got to score it quinns header but we didnt and the longer the game goes on like that you worry something would happen and when they got the free kick you think here we go its almost inevitable

4886934 i want to go to gori ive left my family there i am bringing food for them but they wont let me pass
4886935 im from tbilisi i was here working when the war broke out i was taken in
4886936 im horrified i dont know if its russians or mercenaries doing it
4886937 we are constantly encountering various problems with the georgian side and it will depend how quickly and effectively this problem will be solved
4886938 now russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces
4886939 progress and prospects on water for a clean and healthy world
4886940 its not very popular to talk about toilets and excrement and where to go when you are menstruating this is something that makes people feel uncomfortable
4886941 five thousand children die every day of diarrhea because of a lack of hygiene and sanitation and nobody really cares
4886942 we have to understand that what we eat and the products we buy have an immediate implication for the availability of the worlds water resources
4886943 surprisingly 20 million europeans need access to safe and affordable sanitation
4886944 now weve stopped discussing whether or not there has been climate change or where or who has been contributing to it
4886945 now its all about its there and we have to live with it and the question is okay what to do how to adapt
4886946 i think it looks a little hokey if you ask me
4886947 the fact that these b schools are affiliated to aima is itself a source of credibility aima programmes delivered through the b schools come with the stamp of quality
4886948 look into the placement record faculty and the infrastructure of the institute
4886949 every single detail on the website should be cross checked personally websites may not present the actual picture
4886950 the demand for iims only cater to a minuscule part of it so many companies that recruit from the iims also go to the mat affiliated b schools
4886951 it is important to join a reputed company after a certain point ones performance will do the trick
4886952 our annual ranking gives an insight into the best b schools a student is advised to look for industry interface and placement opportunities to figure out if an institute is good or not
4886953 some dubious b schools which are known to give false advertisements have been ranked high in such surveys surveys can be used as a preliminary filter to shortlist b schools after that students should do their own research by visiting campuses and talking to existing students
4886954 a student should spend a few months on finding out the right institute according to his area of specialisation speaking to the alumni can be a big help
4886955 there were fewer options at that time but with the wide variety available today students have to be extra careful about not falling into the trap of fly by night operators
4886956 to teach you a lesson we are not emptying the bins in the street
4886957 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4886958 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4886959 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4886960 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4886961 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
4886962 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
4886963 jika undang undang qazaf tidak ada kerajaan perlu membuat pindaan di parlimen supaya ia boleh diadili melalui undang undang islam
4886964 rujuk kepada mahkamah syariah mengikut akta 121 1a perlembagaan persekutuan iaitu kes untuk zina dan liwat
4886965 anwar dan saiful bukan suami isteri dan dalam kes ini ia bukan sahaja tidak kena tetapi telah menunjukkan kebodohan umat islam sendiri
4886966 beliau saiful menggunakan agama islam jenama apa kerana ia tidak merupakan hak dalam islam
4886967 bagaimana saiful bersumpah menggunakan quran sedangkan dia tidak tahu isu kandungan kitab suci itu
4886968 dia saiful boleh buat apa sahaja tetapi kita tidak boleh dengar sebelah pihak sahaja
4886969 oleh itu kita tidak mahu membuat hukuman awal seolah olah anwar telah bersalah
4886970 apabila membenarkan anwar bertanding dalam pilihanraya ia merupakan satu kaedah yang beliau tidak bersalah
4886971 dalam islam sesiapapun bebas bersumpah untuk membuktikan dirinya benar tetapi bukanlah dengan memegang kitab suci al quran kerana ia adalah perbuatan orang kristian yang memegang kitab mereka ketika bersumpah
4886972 i hope she does the soup thing its always a hoot and we dont all die from it

4886996 people should know what is happening with their information and have a choice
4886997 our concern is that what is kept with the justification of preventing and detecting terrorism can then be used for minor purposes such as pursuing people for parking fines

4887012 por razones que comprender n a medida que lean lo que sigue no puedo desvelar mi identidad soy un mec nico de aviaci n que trabaja para una l nea a rea importante trabajo en una base de mantenimiento situada en un gran aeropuerto y el azar ha querido que descubra lo que no me estaba visiblemente destinado antes de nada tengo que explicar en dos palabras c mo funciona la jerarqu a en el mundo de los mec nicos aeronavales es importante para comprender mi historia y para la causa a la que ustedes consagran una gran parte de su energ a los mec nicos quieren trabajar en tres dominios la avi nica los motores y los comandos de vuelo se considera que los mec nicos que trabajan en estos sistemas han alcanzado el grado m s alto del escalaf n jer rquico a continuaci n vienen los mec nicos que trabajan en los sistemas hidr ulicos y en los aparatos de climatizaci n despu s se encuentran lo que se ocupan de los sistemas subalternos en fin que en la parte m s baja del escalaf n se encuentran los mec nicos que se dedican a los sistemas de vaciado de aguas residuales ning n mec nico quiere trabajar en las bombas en los tanques y en las tuber as que almacenan los deshechos de los lavabos sin embargo en cada aeropuerto en el que he trabajado siempre hab a 2 3 mec nicos que se presentaban voluntarios para ese servicio los otros est n tan contentos de que lo hagan que nadie presta atenci n a esos individuos y ning n mec nico serio tiene realmente una relaci n con esos mec nicos de segunda clase de hecho yo mismo hasta hace poco nunca me hab a preocupado de este asunto la mayor a de las compa as a reas tienen acuerdos de servicios rec procos con las otras compa as que utilizan el mismo aeropuerto esto significa que si una tiene un problema t cnico uno de nuestros mec nicos se ocupar de l en contrapartida si uno de nuestros aviones tiene alg n problema en el lugar donde otra compa a tiene su base de mantenimiento ellos se encargan de repararlo el mes pasado me llamaron para trabajar en un avi n de otra compa a en el momento de la llamada el controlador no sab a cu l era el problema y no pod a darme ning n detalle cuando llegu al lugar descubr que la aver a se situaba en el almacenaje de desperdicios no hab a otra soluci n ten a que trepar hasta el interior de la carlinga para arreglar el problema al entrar en el compartimento me di cuenta de que hab a algo raro el avi n ten a m s tanques bombas y tuber as de los que se mencionaba en el libro de cargas al principio supuse que se hab a modificado el sistema hac a m s de diez a os que no hab a trabajado en un sistema de ese tipo mientras trataba de encontrar el problema me di cuenta que las tuber as y los tanques suplementarios no estaban conectados al sistema de evacuaci n acababa de descubrirlo cuando otro mec nico de mi compa a apareci de repente era justamente uno de los mec nicos que trabajaba habitualmente en esos sistemas le pas el trabajo con mucho gusto como ya me iba le pregunt a prop sito del equipamiento suplementario me dijo oc pate de tu trabajo y d jame a m preocuparme por el m o al d a siguiente estaba en el ordenador de la compa a viendo un plan de cableado ya que estaba decid hacer una b squeda sobre el equipamiento suplementario que hab a encontrado en el avi n para mi gran sorpresa los manuales no hac an ninguna referencia al equipamiento que hab a visto el d a anterior busqu en los informes del fabricante y tampoco encontr nada me picaba la curiosidad terriblemente estaba decidido a descubrir la naturaleza de aquel equipamiento a la semana siguiente recibimos tres de nuestros aviones en el hangar principal para la inspecci n peri dica los mec nicos trepan por todos lados del avi n durante estas inspecciones acababa de terminar mi trabajo as que decid ir a ver el sistema de evacuaci n de uno de los aparatos con 26 todos los mec nicos alrededor estaba seguro de que nadie se dar a cuenta de mi presencia para mi sorpresa el avi n que decid inspeccionar tambi n pose a ese tipo de equipamiento suplementario segu el sistema de ca er as de bombas y de tanques descubr lo que parec a ser la unidad de mandos del sistema era una caja de mandos est ndar de la avi nica pero sin la m s m nima inscripci n pude seguir los hilos desde la caja de mandos hasta las bombas y hasta las v lvulas pero ning n circuito de mandos llegaba a esa unidad los nicos hilos que estaban conectados a esa unidad se un an al sistema operacional de los mandos del avi n el sistema pose a un gran tanque y dos m s peque os era dif cil ver debido a la estrechez del compartimento pero me pareci que el tanque grande ser a de unos 200 litros los tanques estaban conectados a una v lvula de vaciado y de llenado que pasaba por el fuselaje justo por detr s de la v lvula de vaciado de aguas residuales busqu bajo el avi n para ver d nde conduc a ese empalme vi que estaba escondido detr s de un falso panel bajo otro panel que acced a al sistema de drenaje del vaciado segu las tuber as de las bombas los tubos conduc an a una red de conductos m s peque os que terminaban en los rebordes traseros de las alas y de los estabilizadores horizontales del avi n si miran atentamente las alas de un gran avi n ver n como una coleta de cables de aproximadamente el tama o de un dedo extenderse por el borde posterior del ala son vastagos de descarga est tica se emplean para disipar la electricidad est tica que se acumula en el avi n durante el vuelo descubr que los conductos de ese sistema conduc an a uno de cada tres vastagos de descarga electrost tica esos vastagos hab an sido agujereados como para dejar salir el producto que fuera hac a alg n tiempo que estaba encaramado en el ala cuando de pronto uno de los supervisores me orden abandonar el hangar a continuaci n me dice que mi trabajo hab a terminado y que no estaba autorizado a hacer horas extra los dos d as siguientes estuve muy ocupado y no encontr ni un minuto para seguir mi peque a investigaci n dos d as despu s de mi descubrimiento me llamaron para reemplazar un detector de temperatura del motor de un avi n que ten a que despegar termin el trabajo y volv al papeleo alrededor de 30 minutos m s tarde fui convocado por el director general cuando entr en su despacho me esperaban el representante de nuestro sindicato y otras dos personas que no conoc a el director me dice que se hab a encontrado un problema serio fui suspendido por falta grave me abrieron un expediente disciplinario declarando que hab a escrito datos falsos en mi informe de trabajo relativos al detector de temperatura del motor que acababa de instalar horas antes estaba abatido y comenc a protestar dije que era rid culo y que hab a hecho mi trabajo a conciencia el representante del sindicato intercedi recomend que ech ramos un vistazo para aclarar las cosas en ese momento pregunt qui nes eran los otros dos hombres el director general me indic que eran inspectores de seguridad de la compa a a rea pero que no ten an por qu darme sus nombres 28 fuimos al avi n que ten a que haber despegado pero que todav a estaba aparcado en la rampa de mantenimiento abrimos el motor y el representante de los sindicatos retir el detector de temperatura verific el n mero de serie y constat que era la antigua pieza a continuaci n fuimos al mostrador de piezas y el representante de los sindicatos verific mi informe cogi una caja sellada de una estanter a la abri y retir el detector de temperatura del motor que ten a el mismo n mero de serie que el que yo hab a instalado me dijo que estaba suspendido sin salario durante una semana el primer d a de mi suspensi n descans en casa pregunt ndome lo que me hab a ocurrido durante la tarde recib una llamada telef nica la voz me dijo ahora sabe lo que les ocurre a los mec nicos que meten la nariz donde no les llaman la pr xima vez que trabaje en sistemas que no le incumben perder el empleo como hoy me siento generoso creo que podr volver pronto a su trabajo clic inmediatamente relacion lo que acababa de ocurrir y el descubrimiento de las conducciones misteriosas a la ma ana siguiente me llam el director general me dijo que debido a la excelencia de mi dossier la suspensi n hab a quedado reducida a un d a as que ten a que incorporarme inmediatamente al trabajo la nica cosa en la que pod a pensar era qu intentan esconder y qui nes son la vuelta al trabajo se produjo como si nada hubiera ocurrido ninguno de los otros mec nicos mencion la suspensi n que me hab an impuesto de hecho el representante sindical me dijo que no serv a de nada hablar pero esa noche navegu por internet buscando respuestas no me acuerdo c mo lo consegu pero encontr su p gina por casualidad entonces la situaci n se aclar cada vez m s al d a siguiente por la ma ana en el trabajo encontr una nota escrita en el interior de mi taquilla cerrada con llave dec a la curiosidad mat al gato no visites las p ginas de internet que no te conciernen as que ellos me observan no s lo que est n vaporizando pero puedo certificar que lo hacen me imagino que utilizan los camiones cisterna son los camiones que vac an los deshechos de los tanques de almacenaje de los lavabos habitualmente los aeropuertos subcontratan ese tipo de trabajo y nadie se acerca a esos camiones qui n querr a estar cerca de un cami n lleno de m cuando vac an los tanques de aguas residuales llenan los del sistema de vaporizaci n conocen los planes de vuelo de los aviones de modo que probablemente programan la unidad de mando para que comience a pulverizar cierta cantidad del producto que sea despu s de un tiempo cuando el avi n ha alcanzado una altitud determinada o sobre ciertas aglomeraciones la abertura del vaporizador en los falsos vastagos electrost ticos es tan peque a que nadie en el avi n podr a darse cuenta

4887031 suskind a pulitzer winning reporter and relentless chronicler of this administrations secrets depicts a white house with a simpleminded bully in the oval office taking direction from a paranoid vice president and caps off his latest expose with what he acknowledges sounds a lot like an impeachable offense
4887032 suskind writes in the book that the order to create the letter was written on creamy white house stationery politicos mike allen reports
4887033 the book suggests that the letter was subsequently created by the cia and delivered to iraq but does not say how
4887034 the author claims that such an operation part of false pretenses for war would apparently constitute illegal white house use of the cia to influence a domestic audience an arguably impeachable offense

4887061 the evidentialist position does not insist upon the evidential grounding of every proposition
4887062 think the presuppositionalist takes a rather dim view of the ability of mankind to obtain knowledge about god through the use of reason and observation directed at gods natural revelation
4887063 but the natural man does not welcome what comes from gods spirit because it is foolishness to him he is not able to know it since it is evaluated spiritually
4887064 no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him
4887065 for the sinful nature is always hostile to god it never did obey gods laws and it never will thats why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please god
4887066 the most depraved of men cannot wholly escape the voice of god their greatest wickedness is meaningless except upon the assumption that they have sinned against the authority of god the natural man accuses or else excuses himself only because his own utterly depraved consciousness continues to point back to the original natural state of affairs the prodigal son can never forget the fathers voice it is the albatross forever about his neck

4887076 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4887077 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

4887521 not exactly after i did that it ran towards me to bite off my dick and i raped it into submission as it realized what had happened it had no other choice but to pass on to the next step in death or else stay here forever and live in shame

4887647 its a long process coming back after missing a full year
4887648 when i say hui guo everyone knows guo means china
4887649 but if i were asked where are you from ill answer china
4887650 if there are some famous stars in the chinese team such as diver guo jingjing id want china to win
4887651 the stronger china is the more strength or bargaining chips overseas consulates have
4887652 the taipei economic offices overseas serve similar function as consulates cant do anything but the chinese consulates are different
4887653 tainted toothpaste pet food and so on its such a shame
4887654 there is a hidden danger for more massive anti chinese movements or sentiments in canada
4887655 that has happened before referring to an era when canada stipulated the chinese exclusion act to ban chinese from coming in the 1890s who knows it might happen again it really depends on how far the conservatives want to go
4887656 at the end of the day national interests come first the tories wouldnt be able to completely overturn a canadian policy which has set its roots for over 30 years with success
4887657 if team china vs team canada id hope china win
4887658 but if team taiwan vs team canada or team china id definitely cheer on the taiwanese
4887659 china represents chinese no matter what your political point of view is taiwanese are ethnically chinese and other people see so
4887660 people look down on you if your motherland is weak
4887661 western businesses need to hire mandarin speaking staff to bridge them to the china market
4887662 thats how the status of overseas chinese would be raised
4887663 id say im a canadian i want to live here forever
4887664 i cant see there are any qualified politicians who have a far enough insight into building taiwan
4887665 they are all fighting for short term interests self interests
4887666 in a way the tories anti china attitude is a good thing to the taiwanese
4887667 seeing china as an enemy is wrong for stephen harper china will only grow into a stronger nation and it has the ability to endure hardships let alone empty criticisms
4887668 id definitely cheer for canada but if canada were not playing id cheer for china against any other nation
4887669 i am and will always be loyal to canada as i see myself as a pure canadian with proud chinese roots and am proud of my familys contributions in helping build this young nation canada
4887670 excited because i am living this moment in time that many of my ancestors had wanted to experience during their lives and concerned because the path to which china rises to will depend on the abilities and quality of her leaders
4887671 in its old form the chinese here in canada had historically never occupied real business leadership roles as can be gleaned from historic evidence in the make up professional firm names eg chinese names were rarely seen in partnership titles
4887672 since then we saw an explosion of chinese names onto the titles of law firms accounting firms etc now we see businesses and political parties trying to figure out how to appease to the chinese by inviting persons with chinese names onto their boards whether or not the person is qualified and printing their swag in english and chinese not french supposedly is one of canadas official languages
4887673 now comes the new form of glass ceiling the new inherent barriers are now imposed by the local canadian chinese themselves upon each other
4887674 many of the better and smarter chinese canadians do not view political office as a job of high integrity
4887675 unfortunately that opens the door to a lot of opportunistic chinese canadian candidates who attempt office for one very obvious reason self importance
4887676 suffered the terrible indignity of having had far too many unqualified chinese canadians elected into office
4887677 only to prove time and time again that chinese canadians are inarticulate have no real grasp of the issues and unfortunately surround themselves with sycophants and with unqualified advisors
4887678 there are a number of us who are getting together to help nurture and mentor a new generation of real chinese canadian leaders eventually some of these will make it into public office and will become the role models that the chinese canadian community so desperately desires
4887679 really it doesnt matter to me which team canada or china wins if they are in a say world cup game
4887680 im now a canadian holding a canadian passport although i have dual citizenship in both countries i think my loyalty lies with canada because it has given me and my family such a wonderful life
4887681 sometimes its more of a responsibility or duty for me to be loyal to canada
4887682 if i were in hong kong id just drive by and go hey what does that have anything to do with me right
4887683 this is a very obvious change that i notice of myself after living in canada for seven years
4887684 id say im ethnically chinese and im from hong kong but i cant describe myself being a mainlander

4887766 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and has now violated the space of another country russia has escalated its military campaign through strategic bombing and the movement of its ground forces into the heart of georgia there is no possible justification for these attacks
4887767 for many months i have warned that there needs to be active international engagement to peacefully address the disputes over south ossetia and abkhazia including a high level and neutral international mediator and a genuine international peacekeeping force not simply russian troops
4887768 the president is authorized to use the armed forces of the us as he determines to be necessary appropriate in order to defend the national security of the us against the continuing threat posed by iraq

4887770 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4887778 a judgment is not final so long as post judgment motions are available and time for making such a motion remains
4887779 court has made clear that a ruling on a post judgment motion is necessary to achieve finality
4887780 there is a difference between such adherence the law of the case doctrine and res adjudicata one directs discretion the other supersedes it and compels judgment in other words in one it is a question of power in the other of submission
4887781 any layman is competent to pass judgment and conclude from common experience that such things do not happen if there has been proper skill and care
4887782 trial courts ruling with regard to the necessity of an expert witness is within the courts sound discretion
4887783 the trial court properly exercised its discretion to announce a ruling on the necessity of an expert witness and to grant plaintiff a reasonable time in which to procure an expert
4887784 if the pleadings depositions answers to interrogatories stipulations and admissions on file together with the affidavits if any show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law

4887790 as these additional security measures are taken the units of the russian armed forces that were sent into the zone of the south ossetian conflict will be withdrawn
4887791 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4887792 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4887793 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so

4887795 t he fact that patton was in a powerful position as the governor of kentucky and that he therefore was able to express vindictiveness relating to their personal relationship in a manner which could interfere with her financial stability or career does not elevate the situation to the level of outrageousness required for a plaintiff to recover on a claim for iied

4887811 children of demonstrators will be removed from their parents homes and sent to be re educated
4887812 parents will be indicted for putting their children into danger
4887813 most americans if you ask them have no idea that the government has already made a choice for them
4887814 the government has substituted its choice for the american consumers choice most americans have no idea they wont be able to choose their own light bulbs
4887815 each light bulb contains between 3 6 milligrams of mercury
4887816 theres a question about how that mercury will fill up our landfills and also if you break one in your home youll have mercury that instantaneously vaporizes in your home that poses a very real threat to children disabled people pets senior citizens and i just think its very important that americans have the choice to decide would they like an incandescent or a cfl
4887817 i just dont think its a good idea for congress to jump on board fads every time a fad comes along
4887818 i think we can trust the intelligence of the american consumer to make the choice that theyd like to make
4887819 but i think the american public should have the right to choose which light bulb theyd like to purchase because there are some real with the cfl
4887820 it really isnt an example where you have to choose between the environment and personal choice you can have both
4887821 discredited liar who is peddling another piece of garbage to continue the bush cheney politics he helped perpetuate four years ago
4887822 his is just one of what will likely be many more lie filled books rushed to print this election cycle which are cobbled together from debunked internet sources to make money and advance a partisan agenda
4887823 we will respond to these smears forcefully with all means at our disposal
4887824 one of the most vile smear peddlers of the 2004 election has found a new target
4887825 derision and ridicule are the lowest form of argument suggesting the obama camp already has lost the debate
4887826 the obama camp and its supporters appear to be in disarray over the book responding almost irrationally with an endless string of epithets and insults
4887827 has intentionally manufactured a cult of personality in order to discourage any attempt to examine or comment critically upon any aspect of his background
4887828 critics such as myself are immediately branded as racists to discourage readers from reading and evaluating the book for themselves
4887829 has come out with another book that is also riddled with distortions and falsehoods so the question is why on earth would anyone listen to what he has to say about barack obama
4887830 this is typical media matters they bring you on the show and they bait you up dont give you a chance even to respond
4887831 has intentionally misrepresented my arguments so they can prove as false claims i never made while proclaiming mistakes over trivial points in the book they chose to nit pick in support of their obvious leftist political agenda
4887832 right now vile smear peddler jerome corsi is back with a of lies this time about barack obama well need the combined efforts of every member of the action wire to push back against this years vicious republican attack book
4887833 its number one on the new york times best seller list right now i would be very aggressive with reporters and factually going through the book and responding and making it clear that this is a bunch of bullsh t
4887834 didnt hesitate to make unequivocal claims as to the corsi books inaccuracy
4887835 alleges obama is on the extreme left of american politics and has extensive connections to islam and with radical racial politics this despite the fact that for months obamas been explaining hes not muslim
4887836 this act disgusted and shocked citizens all over the commonwealth
4887837 these violent killings were totally unnecessary particularly considering that there are rescue societies that would have taken all of the dogs regardless of their ages or conditions
4887838 clearly the time has come to enact legislation that would make this practice illegal and raise the standards under which the states commercial breeding kennel industry operates there is simply no excuse for continued inaction

4887846 you always dream about these moments we were underdogs going into all of our matches and i think some of the other countries didnt expect wed be as strong as we were
4887847 and for us the team dynamic is so great anything was possible for us and everything clicked today
4887848 we woke up this morning and knew we had a good draw with poland and hungary and were excited about it

4887856 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4887857 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4887858 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4887859 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4887860 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4887896 the second law of thermodynamics trumps the laws of economics
4887897 if the world was made of oil there would still be a finite supply of it
4887898 if kindness and comfort are as i suspect the results of an energy surplus then as the supply contracts we could be expected to start fighting once again like cats in a sack
4887899 one of our central tasks is the creation of the post oil megacity

4888009 there has been a lot of misinformation on this issue
4888010 some idea was put out by i dont know who a rumour or some source that the chair leads the discussion that is just not the case my view is im there to ensure that the meeting runs well and fairly and that the vote is taken fairly not to weigh in in favour or against a particular candidate
4888011 i feel reasonably comfortable about the process doing it the way i have outlined that i do it and not getting involved in voting for a particular candidate or advocating for a particular candidate
4888012 i made a personal policy decision that i would not weigh in for or against a particular name and that is the way i have always proceeded
4888013 in fact i do not vote except i reserve the right to vote in the rare case of a tie im told that i voted once to break a tie i dont have a recollection of that my recollection is that i have never voted
4888014 based on the explanation that chief justice mclachlin gave us today what she explained her role as it is not likely to be viewed as judicial misconduct

4888025 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4888026 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

4888028 we are told we are being mean all the time but what nobody mentions is why the drugs are so expensive
4888029 pharmaceutical companies have enjoyed double digit growth year on year and they are out to sustain that not least because their senior managements earnings are related to the share price
4888030 its not in their interests to take less profit personally as well as from the point of view of the business all these perverse incentives drive the price up
4888031 the mccain campaign is disappointed in the decision of the contest committee and stands by the nevada republican party
4888032 the problem is that brake lights are yes and no on and off
4888033 the driver behind does not know the speed at which the car in front is slowing or stopping the only other signal would be the smoke off the tires
4888034 a driver could be tapping his foot in time to music and the brake lights would blink or a driver can rest her foot on the pedal and the lights would glow its not enough information for the following driver
4888035 two cars back was a young woman with a child in the car they were okay but she kept saying i couldnt tell how fast he was stopping i thought wouldnt it be a good idea if rear tail lights communicated better and the following driver knew how fast you were stopping so they could take appropriate action
4888036 he was very helpful and encouraging saying that this concept had the potential of great application at a very low cost
4888037 he subsequently introduced me to dr mehdi ahmadian who was able to develop this project into a teaching research curriculum over the next several years
4888038 the draw backs are that the light bar would be an additional brake light because the law forbids altering original equipment
4888039 it would be for commercial trucks rather than private cars because commercial vehicles typically have redundant lights
4888040 private cars are 10 to 15 years behind commercial vehicles in terms of led lighting
4888041 we also have the ability to connect other sensors to the microcontroller such as from the automatic braking system the automatic traction control and the collision avoidance system
4888042 if any of these systems are activated lights could flash to alert drivers of nearby vehicles
4888043 there are various ways for this invention to work and we have a working prototype
4888044 a manufacturer can take the specifications and produce this circuit in mass quantities
4888045 not only is this concept approaching potential commercialization which will be most gratifying but the educational benefit derived by numerous mechanical engineering students over the years is very heartwarming to me as well
4888046 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4888047 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4888048 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4888049 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4888050 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4888051 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4888052 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4888056 i know a lot of people who would love it if i were to connect them with other business providers i know i usually dont do this because it takes too long to make this type of connection it looks like passitto may make this process easier allowing me to get brownie points with my customers for helping them find other business providers i dont know of any other website that does this yet
4888057 when exchanging referrals within a tight knit group of business contacts you may decide you wont require those members to bid credits upon your referrals one possible reason is you are probably acquaintances and familiar with these other members and your incentive for providing these referrals is to receive reciprocal referrals in exchange you know these people you provide them referrals they give them back to you and everything is great you gain some social capital in addition to reciprocal referrals

4888061 our first preference is to remain on the current site subject to city approval to enable us to do that

4888063 when it started it was small and there werent many neighbors around there its grown over time but so has the neighborhood so theyre now shoe horned into a small box the challenge is can that small box meet their needs for the next 30 years
4888064 lakeview hospital clearly has an interest in staying in stillwater but they need some cooperation in order to do that
4888065 and lake elmo being very near and very inexpensive relatively speaking is a great bargaining chip
4888066 weve always recognized that our chances of getting lakeview hospital are 50 50 at best
4888067 if we keep doing what were doing were going to continue to get what we got
4888068 we do have some issues our systems dont operate the best
4888069 the physical character of each is quite different how does a planning process take that into account you talk about a bold vision but that doesnt answer what scott county winds up looking like

4888071 we need to avoid allowing access points every 200 feet
4888072 no one is going to come in and build us a freeway
4888073 prior lakes new long range plan was approved two years ago yet we havent even received shakopees yet part of the bold new vision is to synchronize the planning process
4888074 its not to take power from anyone its to coordinate
4888075 do we have flexibility if our bold new vision turns out to be off the mark

4888086 we are in the caveman days as far as the reading technology pribyl said
4888087 our biggest fear is that the manufacturer will call up and say theyre no longer supporting this
4888088 it will allow them to keep some control over their divorce situation and those divorce situations can be very horrible you walk into the courtroom and the parties have been slandered and vilified tensions are running very very high its like walking into a volcano

4888090 the cases have only one thing in common nobody looks forward to divorce court

4888103 last year we didnt have nearly this many people and we only had about 80 items so its getting bigger and bigger every year
4888104 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract
4888105 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the from engaging in business dealings with iranian nationals
4888106 i am sure he will play there this season because he has played great at the olympics he is a talented player he is ok for beginning in the nba after practicing a few years you will see that he will be one of the great players
4888107 the iranian basketball federation supports him to play in the best situation for his basketball career
4888108 we would like for him to go to a place where he will play not sit on the bench thats very important for our basketball and also for him

4888113 were not trying to suprise anybody with the fact that our sites have unpopular an inflammatory opinions on them

4888118 like i said it is one sided you initially get charged for the modem that gives you a rebate check three months later for 1 3 the price you paid you cannot make changes to the account without it renewing unless the changes benefit att sbc you cannot move without it renewing and getting charged a transfer fee if you move you can go to a month to month basis but you will be charged 99 if you move and dsl prices differ from that of the original quote you will get charged the difference if you move and att sbc does not service that area you get charged 99 if you move and they only provide phone and no dsl you get charged 99 customer service is poor agents dont know your situations if transferred false promises
4888119 this is at amp t this is how we do it

4888127 any time they get it done its important to us
4888128 it was just important in the context that they got it done and we were able to hold a lead i dont think they have to prove anything by bouncing back theyve been there all year for us
4888129 wasnt the first time ive had the bases loaded no outs wont be the last
4888130 i was just a little out of whack man it happens its part of the game
4888131 that whole inning obviously the momentum was going their way
4888132 darren gets the punch out of shoppach and theres a little light at the end of the tunnel but garkos been tough off the bat i thought it was in there
4888133 thats as much range as youre going to see from a shortstop that was incredible

4888258 in germany there are turbines above forests and the mortality rate of bats has been found to be high
4888259 in scotland it was thought to be less of a problem because turbines tend to be in wide open spaces where bats are less likely to be
4888260 one of the concerns is that the blades turn so fast the bats cant detect them and another is a change in pressure which it is believed to damage the bats internally
4888261 events are being held all over scotland and europe and the bat walks that are held are one of the most helpful things we can do
4888262 there have been people who have found a bat in trouble and able to get it help because a neighbour went on one of the walks and knew what to do

4888273 not as much as i expected though the offense had a very good week of practice i mean a very good week today they didnt perform where they should but they executed better
4888274 the defense you cant give up big plays yet the defense made enough plays sacks a couple recoveries and stuff that would have gotten them off the field and changed the complexion so i think theres some give and take there i thought the defense played very well i really did

4888322 on august 7 after days of shooting incidents in the south ossetian conflict zone georgian president mikheil saakashvili made a speech in which he said that he had given the georgian villagers orders not to fire that he wanted to offer south ossetia unlimited autonomy within the georgian state with russia to be a guarantor of the arrangement
4888323 both sides said they were discussing a meeting the next day to discuss how to defuse the clashes
4888324 that evening however saakashvili went for the military option the georgian military launched a massive artillery attack on tskhinvali followed the next day by a ground assault involving tanks
4888325 this was a city with no pure military targets full of civilians who had been given no warning and were expecting peace talks at any moment
4888326 the attack looked designed to take everybody by surprise perhaps because much of the russian leadership was in beijing for the opening of the olympic games it also unilaterally destroyed the negotiating and peacekeeping arrangements under the aegis of the organization for security and cooperation in europe that have been in place for 16 years russian peacekeeping troops based in south ossetia were among those killed in the georgian assault

4888372 he does not speak with as much passion as id like to see in a political leader but his restrained style does compel a belief of credibility
4888373 while several of mccains answers were brief and direct he followed many with self serving anecdotes e g the most gut wrenching decision was one to sacrifice his early release from a pow camp to benefit another prisoner yet another reference to his experience as a pow
4888374 no i dont think so but im sure liberals particulalry anti war liberals will agree that he is its not surprising that his deepest experiences come from those years
4888375 of course he is i knew hed raise the pow issue took him less than 10 minutes and i could swear i heard him catch his breath in his throat in 20 minutes hes brought it up three times in three different topics
4888376 his pow experience has if you were listening an item of response to the questions asked but you wouldnt care about that mccain is hitting it out of the park

4888380 his honesty and candid replies and his in depth analysis of the issues also his quick wit and sense of humor
4888381 obama seemed throughout his interview to be searching for the right answer for this audience while mccain came on to each question strongly and easily one candidate mccain is comfortable with who he is and the other appeared uncomfortable with the idea of letting his true self show
4888382 i can see that many would be uncomfortable with mccain seeing similarities with bush i am not among them i want to know who im voting for and i want my president to be transparent about what he stands for to know it in his soul and to act always truthfully to that core

4888688 broadly speaking we think it is a great place to take the game we are working towards that at the moment there are still a few issues we are trying to work through but we hope that we can overcome them
4888689 that is one of the most disgraceful decisions that ive ever seen in my life
4888690 i got stitched up a few weeks ago for the exact same thing and i never actually knew that pointing at an umpire was an actual law
4888691 there wasnt any swearing or unjust words i did ask him the umpire on the way i said i didnt swear at you what was it for and he said you pointed at me in a direct manner and that was that

4888693 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4888694 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4888695 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4888696 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4888697 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4888698 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4888699 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4888700 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4888701 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4888702 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4888703 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4888704 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4888705 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4888706 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable
4888707 theyll be able to reach other physicians and specialists immediately and eliminate the phone tag that costs hours of time and impacts patient care
4888708 by putting her name in nomination youre putting people on the spot
4888709 having a roll call just chews into your broadcast time
4888710 i believe there are a lot of supporters for hillary among the superdelegates especially now that theyve agreed to place her name in nomination i think half the house democrats would probably be hillary supporters especially women i felt she was the most experienced and the best candidate and i still feel that way
4888711 it could backfire and show that her influence is waning chances are shes not going to have as many delegates vote for her on the floor as she had in the primary
4888712 i think that most superdelegates including myself are going for obama
4888713 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
4888714 my boss is totally conflicted about it and pissed hillary is putting us in this position
4888715 we still havent made up our mind and i dont know when we are going to
4888716 the convention is about nominating barack so his people want to speed through the vote as fast as possible so it wont take too much tv time
4888717 they also want to avoid a scenario where shes leading at any point
4888718 i made my decision for obama and im not switching again
4888719 those who insist upon the unaltered retention of traditional forms of religious understanding and language and who retreat from the challenge posed by the actual world after galileo want to direct the christian community into the confines of a sacred grotto an enclosed religiously defined world that is brought completely under the control of scripture and tradition and they want to turn the ordained clergy into antiquities dealers

4888725 we leave our homes at 8 a m every morning and return at 4 m in the afternoon
4888726 what we want is to see our sons and husbands to ensure they are fine
4888727 so far they havent accused our sons and husbands of anything some of these men have been in the detention for more than two months without charges and that is against the law
4888728 if there is no reply to our demands to release our sons and husbands we will direct the international agencies and organizations foreign embassies and even tribal leaders to help solve our case
4888729 our sons are not involved in any criminal activities or political movements against the government
4888730 maybe the only thing they did was talk publicly about their views against the war in saada
4888731 the kidnappers then held captive the algerian expert along with his two drivers and took them to al khobar area before the security authorities intervened and released them
4888732 the warnings released by the french foreign ministry will not affect french people living in yemen and the embassy will continue its normal activities
4888733 the commercial relations are not affected and total which is the biggest cooperative investment effort between the two countries will resume normal activities unaffected by the warnings
4888734 are assuming normal cultural activities that are not linked to political decisions so far there are no changes in our programs
4888735 unnecessary because the security forces have taken all measures against terrorist attacks and expanded their procedures for protecting foreigners
4888736 such announcements serve the terrorists cause because terrorist actions happen all over the world not only in yemen and we need joint efforts to face them

4888783 de ontwikkeling in het zwemmen gaat momenteel te snel het is hetzelfde als wanneer bij het voetbal van de ene op de andere dag de doelpalen verder uit elkaar worden gezet en de lat hoger komt te liggen zodat er meer wordt gescoord zulke kunstgrepen heeft de zwemsport niet nodig
4888784 maar dat neemt niet weg dat ik hier ontwikkelingen heb gezien die me zorgen baren innovatie is goed maar we moeten de sport beschermen tegen excessen gezien de frequentie waarmee hier in peking wereldrecords worden gezwommen en de marges waarmee dat gebeurt kan niet verondersteld worden dat zoiets louter het gevolg is van goede training van de atleten
4888785 what a world full of pain surprises ups and downs
4888786 however nothing changed as he continually experienced pain over and over moving toward the worse by following a bad life direction rather than taking the bull by the horns everyone called him retarded and said retarded people are nothing it was hell watching him walk around all eyes on his paralyzed right arm
4888787 he had his own daily routine of studying supporting his poor family and doing his daily exercises at his sports club nobody liked having him around and most hated him
4888788 because he was retarded it wasnt easy adjusting to that fact but he endured it by trying to make friends with some sportsmen taking no offense he moved ahead
4888789 it took him only a year to learn and attain brilliance and stardom
4888790 one day while playing in one of the most important matches he proved that he was the best around after hed finished the match a supervisor from the national football team came up to talk to him he told the orphan that his name was on the list of national team players
4888791 he was a real selfless pioneer who would push the envelope in art and technology without great expectations of returns
4888792 he didnt need to make a lot of money he didnt need to be famous he really just wanted to do great work
4888793 theyre taking care of him and were very grateful for it
4888794 theres nothing thats conclusive nothing really negative and it sounds all positive to me
4888795 my understanding is that this was a routine mri at this point for someone after surgery but he has been sorer than anyone has anticipated so the doctor who did the surgery is also going to look at this mri so theres nothing with the labrum at all its just sore
4888796 i dont think its too optimistic yet but im also realistic to know that the time is drawing close for him to do that effectively
4888797 well see what monday brings i dont think there is a drop dead day but if by some time next week hes not letting the ball go a little bit it would be hard to imagine
4888798 in a perfect world he would be no 3 but i have a lot of confidence in how he has worked at it the team is well rounded enough to put their arms around him and make it work whatever happens its our job to find a way to win
4888799 its frustrating it really is but rest is the best thing for it
4888800 its still a little sore its just day to day and im being positive about it i hope its a routine thing
4888801 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4888802 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4888803 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4888804 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4888805 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4888806 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4888807 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4888808 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4888809 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

4888813 when we know why the war broke out we will then know why it ceased
4888814 it is impossible for you to do anything without consulting me
4888815 twenty five years ago a man and his wife were awakened by the screaming of a child in front of their house gate the child was carefully wrapped by a clean white piece of cloth that covered his body he seemed to have been born a few hours earlier and taken deliberately to that house because that family is rich
4888816 his doubts began to surface his adoptive parents realized that they had to finally disclose their long held secret the day after they told him ahmed disappeared to the great pain of his adoptive parents who are still looking for him
4888817 though these children are of unknown parentage it does not necessarily mean that they are illegitimate as many people think
4888818 i see that the problem is not with laws it is with the community that shows great contempt for children of unknown parentage and unjustly labels them as bastards
4888819 the community today does not accept them as human beings and charges them with a crime they never committed ignoring gods saying that no one should ever get the blame for other peoples mistakes
4888820 children of unknown parentage still have the right to live a decent life though he or she carries the sins of others and lives in a merciless community
4888821 when a child either a male or female lives with members of a family where he or she is not their real child and he or she is not fed with their milk this is a violation against religion because the family members are not his or her mahram
4888822 children of unknown parentage are a result of adultery and seeking a legal or judicial solution for them will contribute to the increasing crime rate and this legislative act will make solutions into mistakes
4888823 the existence of such a project will put limits on those children and on the society will deal with them as people of unknown parentage
4888824 it is their task to discuss the laws related with judiciary procedures
4888825 religion puts forth regulations for child support and the law says that there should be identification of those children
4888826 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4888827 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4888828 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4888829 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4888830 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4888831 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4888832 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4888833 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4888834 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4888835 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

4888844 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4888845 we said that we simply cant undo in one budget what has taken 12 years to develop so we said wed have a fundamental look at the level of the pension
4888846 we also in the budget paid the bonus for the aged pension as we increased the utilities allowance and said wed go away and have a serious look at this issue of pension adequacy
4888847 what youre dealing with here when youre dealing in the inadequacy of a pension is a very big structural change in the budget
4888848 we are going to look at all of the issues we are to some extent in the hands of the harmer committee
4888849 well look at their report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way

4888876 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
4888877 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
4888878 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
4888879 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
4888880 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
4888881 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
4888882 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
4888883 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

4888886 un ingl s llamado saham o sam ishlop y un italiano llamado peduzzi estos individuos se ocupan pura y exclusivamente en la caza de indios ya sea en territorio chileno o argentino mediante una libra esterlina por cada individuo macho y 5 chelines por cada muchacho o mujer

4888891 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4888892 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4888893 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4888894 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4888895 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4888896 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4888897 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4888898 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4888899 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4888900 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4888901 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4888902 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4888903 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4888904 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4888905 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4888906 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4888907 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4888908 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4888909 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4888910 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4888911 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche

4888918 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados

4888920 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4888921 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4888922 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4888923 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4888924 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4888925 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4888926 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4888927 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4888928 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4888929 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4888937 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4888938 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4888939 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4888940 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4888941 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4888944 in order to get a lesser charge i pretended i was nuts so ever since then ive been hooked up with the mental facilities
4888945 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4888946 torres is a key player and he can change games
4888947 with strikers you talk about goals but he was working really hard against their centre backs it is important for the team to have this type of player
4888948 i dont think we were sharp enough to finish what we created
4888949 i also believe that with everyone fit we can create more clear cut chances
4888950 i am confident in us i know we are not making headlines with big names but it is what we produce on the pitch which is important
4888951 for the moment berbatov is a spurs player we are happy with him he is part of the spurs squad and there is nothing to say about it
4888952 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4888953 inflicting great harm on our economy and on america workers
4888954 skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4888955 russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
4888956 russia also holds vast petroleum wealth and this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that russia is clearly prepared to use
4888957 all of this only adds to the urgency of producing more of our own energy including americas enormous oil reserves that lie offshore
4888958 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4888959 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor
4888960 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system
4888961 so from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4888962 i do want a normal life i want to love my family and i do but as i want to do this i think it through i come home and then i cant get along for an hour this anger of mine just makes everything sour i cant be normal i dont know how i wish it would just stop like right now

4888991 we need to avoid allowing access points every 200 feet
4888992 no one is going to come in and build us a freeway
4888993 prior lakes new long range plan was approved two years ago yet we havent even received shakopees yet part of the bold new vision is to synchronize the planning process
4888994 its not to take power from anyone its to coordinate
4888995 do we have flexibility if our bold new vision turns out to be off the mark

4889003 we have won at everton and not many teams do that apart from the top four it was a great achievement
4889004 i dont care who ended it we needed to win this game
4889005 theyve held the lead for me all year in every game
4889006 i just go out and do what im supposed to do sometimes it doesnt work out the way you hope but we won the game in the end and thats ultimately the most important thing
4889007 theres not a ton of results right now but i think im getting closer to where i need to be to help this team win a lot more ballgames in the future

4889051 please paulo ive always thought you were a selfish classist prick but even i always admired you for not cutting all your family loose when you took your vows youre an honorable man who does his job as best and humanely as he can unlike good old kevan who could probably tell a joke while putting a man down no one thought twice about your interest in your widowed cousins pregnancy including me hell i remember that party your aunt threw for you when you got that commendation almost five years ago you and original formula gina were tight like twins
4889052 aside from then i havent had any of you anywhere near my family the pregnancy was more than a year later the only new pics of family ive ever had in the office were of my niece
4889053 i had a really maternal day shortly after we all realized your so called cousin was expecting started regretting that i would never give birth actually took a slipcar to your aunts new house to give your cousin a gift for the baby i saw a pregnant woman gardening with your aunt i realized right away it wasnt gina when she stood up even with the cosmetic changes and i had the driver move on
4889054 youve held onto this for a long time maree you never struck me as the extortionist type what is it you need or want
4889055 paulo you are going to expose me for a traitor and terrorist
4889056 maree that is even less you than the role of blackmailer is are you off on some cloak and blade escapade
4889057 i have played everyone in the vatican for fools my entire career paulo and ive been played a fool myself by well youll know who i work for soon enough the less real information you know the better for the lies you need to tell it ends today paulo with us getting back in that car and heading to the slipgate station while we are en route you are going to begin making calls starting with my own linkpad code i will not answer your call you will try again using the emergency mode i still will not answer then you will call the tower you will tell security to lock down my slipchair and to secure everything in the suite that is mine
4889058 and tell her what you have done you will tell her i seemed to be acting strangely yesterday especially when we all left the tower you will tell her it didnt seem like much at the time but it suddenly hit you this morning that the holo emitter in my slipchair has been misfiring an awful lot lately and you sense there is a connection if you think you need to tell her you saw me fiddling with my chairs servpanel a lot too whenever you and i were alone in the suite you will tell her i am avoiding your calls this morning which is awfully strange with the mysterious death of a pope and all the chaos of the upcoming millennial you will tell her you remember that i have some family in astoria and that all of them men women and children should be detained by local authorities immediately until you all can sort out whats up with me
4889059 paulo that part of my family has nothing to do with anything but if they are not detained they will be murdered for the love of god do all this and do it without question they may already be dead or worse because of what im doing now this slipcars detour and the body in the trunk that hasnt reported in yet will not go unnoticed
4889060 what couldnt wait for five minutes until im on the bridge
4889061 sorry sir but someones gone missing daywatch prep crew noticed a few missing names on the lights out logoffs and theres one still unaccounted for
4889062 so start scouring the service tunnels for someone sleeping off a drunk
4889063 its counselor atkins sir hes not in his cabin and not responding to linkpad calls
4889064 yes sir you see the problem atkins is a slave to protocol and not apt to go off on a bender
4889065 he was scheduled for a session with crewman ahhhh dimitri martin
4889066 im not is that one of the new crew we picked up last week the name sounds vaguely familiar
4889067 all right we need this crewman for an interview then right now ill be there momentarily
4889068 already on it sir martin is on his way to the bridge officers briefing room should i wait for you before i talk to him
4889069 might as well a couple minutes isnt going to make much difference

4889074 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4889075 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4889076 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4889077 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4889078 behold david and solomon truly had many wives and concubines which thing was abominable before me saith the lord
4889079 wherefore my brethren hear me and hearken to the word of the lord for there shall not any man among you have save it be one wife and concubines he shall have none
4889080 for if i will saith the lord of hosts raise up seed unto me i will command my people otherwise they shall hearken unto these things
4889081 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4889082 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4889083 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4889084 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4889085 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4889086 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4889087 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4889088 for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven
4889089 it hath been written that whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement
4889090 verily verily i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whoso shall marry her who is divorced committeth adultery
4889091 pray in your families unto the father always in my name that your wives and your children may be blessed
4889092 what does the book of mormon say about marriage amp the family
4889093 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4889094 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4889095 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4889096 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4889097 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4889098 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4889099 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4889100 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4889101 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4889102 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4889103 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4889104 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4889105 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4889106 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4889107 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4889108 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4889109 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4889110 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4889111 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4889112 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4889113 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4889114 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4889115 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4889116 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4889117 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4889118 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4889119 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4889120 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4889121 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4889122 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4889123 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4889124 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

4889130 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4889131 it is narrow minded in their more privileged fellow creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings to playing on the piano and embroidering bags
4889132 it is highly unlikely that there will be anything today we will see tomorrow

4889154 now faith means we are confident of what we hope for convinced of what we do not see
4889155 faith is the warranty deed the thing for which you have fondly hoped for is at last yours
4889156 you are wrong for focusing on loss mei ling you are completely and utterly wrong you are wrong to want to have wished for a life in your birth country those people that you call siblings just share your dna they mean nothing to you because you lack memories with them they are strangers you do not know them you should have not initated contact with those people if they gave you they obviously could not have wanted you you should stop being so ungrateful for the parents you have now they raised you you dont know that other life in taiwan you will never have that life so stop dwelling on something you will never have you dont know those people that place that culture or that language you shouldnt even be calling them parents they did nothing but give birth to you and giving birth does not make someone a mother or a parent they are strangers to you and you are foolish for wanting something that you can never have you are foolish for wanting something that you already have in your adoptive country stop thinking about the loss youre just making it seem worse than it really is you didnt lose anything mei ling nothing they arent your family in the real sense and they will never be your real family the real family is the one you have now
4889157 bush is pro life too and abortions havent gone down so im going to vote for
4889158 they dont see as much difference between themselves and others
4889159 students who dont cheat seem to be in the minority and have plenty of opportunities to see their peers cheat and receive the rewards with little risk of punishment
4889160 we see avoiding cheating as a form of everyday heroism in an academic setting
4889161 the heroes didnt rationalize cheating the way others did they didnt come up with excuses and say it was ok because lots of other students were doing it
4889162 these 29 percent are like undecided voters they would be an especially good focus for intervention
4889163 our results suggest that interventions may have a real opportunity to influence at least a quarter of the student population
4889164 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
4889165 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
4889166 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
4889167 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
4889168 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
4889169 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well

4889186 it looks like russia is carrying out a long slow punishment of its disobedient little neighbor georgia which got way too close to the u s

4889188 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop
4889189 even after we stopped having sex we would still kiss occasionally

4889192 it would have been nice if someone had told me that when i bought the three different colors to paint samples because i just finished priming the whole room white
4889193 how much is the paint because the primer is 25 a gallon and if the paint is about that maybe i should just do two coats of color
4889194 they asked me if my mom was a mexican and if she had her papers or a green card i answered all their questions telling them my mama didnt need a green card that she was born in florida
4889195 i walked around the corner from the hallway and saw a tall man reach toward his gun and look straight at me
4889196 we target egregious employers those who have built their business model on hiring an illegal workforce
4889197 this practice undercuts legal law abiding companies and can create an environment where employee welfare and labor standards are not enforced
4889198 at this record rate of arrests it would still take 2 943 years to deport the estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants
4889199 thats where the majesty of the judicial system and the deportation process was dispensed there in the cattle barn
4889200 the removal of mr guzman is not an isolated incident
4889201 they asked me if my mom was a mexican and if she had her papers or a green card i answered all their questions telling them my mama didnt need a green card that she was born in florida
4889202 we noticed in several cities we visited that people were walking on cobblestone paths and people were standing on them and sometimes dancing on them doing weight shifting
4889203 we thought if we could scientifically measure it we could see if there were health benefits
4889204 if they had done it over two years and lost 10 pounds i might be less surprised
4889205 theres a lot of evidence that shows no matter who you are it improves if you challenge it
4889206 it could be very helpful for people who are older because its common as we age to lose receptors in the vestibular system
4889207 but by challenging people with an unstable surface they use the remaining vestibular system and probably improve its function
4889208 it certainly suggests there is something real about the cobblestones
4889209 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4889210 women far outnumber men as victims of intimate partner violence and intimate partner violence is deadlier for women what do i base this on try reading the justice departments studies which are conducted impartially and which are based on police reports fbi reports and the national crime victimization survey what does the justice department say about intimate partner violence that women are victims of violence by intimate partners far more often than are men how much more often well according to the justice department which oughta know 85 of intimate violence is committed against women only 5 15 of intimate violence is committed against men and please be sure to notice that that figure includes same sex violence

4889218 the germans killed six million jews and barely six years later you made peace with them but with us the jews refuse to make peace
4889219 the big difference between public school and home schooling would be the fact that we have lots of curriculum to choose from its a great freedom we have
4889220 public school children go to school theyre given their textbooks and thats what they use home schoolers choose from all kinds of curriculum
4889221 normally home schoolers will start buying curriculum in april may or june so they have the summer to look through it
4889222 we might do some reading and math to keep it in their minds so they dont lose it
4889223 moms volunteer to teach certain classes and kids sign up to take those classes
4889224 there is somewhat of a transition like a public or private school kid in that they have to get up in the morning and go somewhere but thats only one day a week
4889225 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4889226 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4889227 last year there were 60 qbs that started in the regular season
4889228 unless all 60 are better than me i expect that my career in the nfl will continue
4889229 i am not convinced that i would gain anything from having an agent at this point in my career
4889230 when i visited the packers i felt real good about the opportunity to back up aaron rodgers on a good team
4889231 i just sensed that when it was time to negotiate that there were some unresolved issues that kept them from giving me a market value offer i think that the brett favre situation was in the background
4889232 i just was not willing to take the vet minimum
4889233 in fact until you mentioned it i didnt think about it its good to have them both back
4889234 gee i wish i was at a vip club in my 7 jeans

4889239 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew whatever you do to the least of my brothers you do to me
4889240 he has it brett favre has it with capital letters hes got the big it colt brennan just finds a way to get it undone

4889262 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
4889263 provide specialized equipment technical knowledge or assistance of expert personnel
4889264 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
4889265 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
4889266 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
4889267 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government

4889275 if someone can kill an american soldier it is better than wasting time on other matters
4889276 whats it going to take to get them to hit in afghanistan does have to attack the pentagon
4889277 if someone can kill an american soldier it is better than wasting time on other matters
4889278 whats it going to take to get them to hit al qaeda in afghanistan does al qaeda have to attack the pentagon
4889279 you who still have a shred of faith in your hearts have you forgotten that to kill infidels and the enemies of islam is a deed that has a reward above no other arent you aware that the model for us all the prophet mohammed and the four rightful caliphs undertook to murder infidels as one of their primary activities and that the prophet waged jihad operations 77 times in the first 10 years as head of the muslim community in medina
4889280 the jihadist tract reportedly began its life in balis kerobokan prison where mukhlas was jailed until recently
4889281 he wrote about average persons in a way that made their stories important to everyone
4889282 why didnt you tell me about that i would have loved to write that story
4889283 the rest of us might be stuck in a rainstorm but not donnie
4889284 he held up a mirror to the city of st paul
4889285 i have some books in the back of the room in case any of you are interested
4889286 theyve got a king and the king wants to sit on the throne
4889287 have to be shown its not going to be acceptable
4889288 this is one of the most cherished sites in our state
4889289 we always have to try to strike a balance between public access and security for the building and for the people there
4889290 we intend to charge them to the fullest extent of the law
4889291 majesty akahi nui the king of hawaii has now reoccupied the throne of hawaii the kingdom of hawaii is now re enacted
4889292 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4889293 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4889294 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4889295 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4889296 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4889297 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4889298 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4889299 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4889300 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4889301 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4889302 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4889303 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4889304 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4889305 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4889306 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4889307 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4889308 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4889309 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4889310 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4889311 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4889312 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4889313 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4889314 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4889315 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4889316 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4889317 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4889318 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4889319 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4889320 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4889321 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4889322 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4889323 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4889324 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4889325 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4889326 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4889327 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4889328 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4889329 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4889330 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4889331 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4889332 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4889333 i love the fact that members get a key card and can use it to come in the door anytime thats 24 7 365 days a year and they can use every snap fitness center not just the one thats in their neighborhood
4889334 we want clients to get the workout they expect and the results they want our goal is to make that happen
4889335 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4889336 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4889337 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4889338 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4889339 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4889340 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4889341 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4889342 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4889343 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4889344 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
4889345 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4889346 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4889347 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4889348 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4889349 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4889350 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4889351 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4889352 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
4889353 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
4889354 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
4889355 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
4889356 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
4889357 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
4889358 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
4889359 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
4889360 either way the election goes youre going to have a major rethinking of how were organized in terms of oversight of financial markets
4889361 both believe that special interest lobbyists had their way with congress and the regulatory agencies a conclusion tailored to fit their overall anti washington pro change campaign themes
4889362 when you are in youre in right but when they take you take it from me they take you good
4889363 all of our customers just love expressing their life values and inspiration by displaying them on their jewelry whether it be a self created bracelet pendant or earring
4889364 our goal is to guide customers through an outstanding experience and have them come out of that experience with meaningful gifts that capture lifes unforgettable moments
4889365 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4889366 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4889367 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4889368 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
4889369 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground
4889370 when i die i want to be remembered as a woman who lived in the 20th century and who dared to be a catalyst of change i dont want to be remembered as the first black woman who went to congress and i dont even want to be remembered as the first woman who happened to be black to make the bid for the presidency i want to be remembered as a woman who fought for change in the 20th century thats what i want
4889371 barack obama attracting 44 of the vote while john mccain earns 41
4889372 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
4889373 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
4889374 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
4889375 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
4889376 the fact that this event is even taking place is significant
4889377 it could provide an opportunity for barack obama to make some inroads but i think youll see john mccain stressing his conservative credentials
4889378 usually they go republican the fact that obama is in there with a chance of maybe getting a share of that vote is in some respects a great triumph for him
4889379 to be perfectly blunt its hard to imagine al gore or john kerry doing very well at this kind of a forum but barack obama speaks very movingly about issues of faith and values
4889380 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush
4889381 hannah montana and miley cyrus best of both worlds concert
4889382 a lottery and you know that with lotteries you lose most of the time
4889383 theres nothing like taking a nice quiet bomb apart to steady the nerves
4889384 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
4889385 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
4889386 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
4889387 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
4889388 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
4889389 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4889390 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4889391 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4889392 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4889393 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4889394 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4889395 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4889396 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4889397 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4889398 we want young chinese girls or boys to get such an impression from this place that 20 years from now theyll want to work for johnson amp johnson
4889399 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4889400 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4889401 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4889402 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4889403 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4889404 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4889405 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4889406 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted me to meet at midnight sunday night id be there
4889407 its the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind and its happening very very fast
4889408 the u s with texas in the lead added more in wind power than the world added in coal power last year
4889409 it is clear that he and i have two very different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4889410 a plan has been hatched to liquidate me and the governor by hired killers because we put in danger the lucrative illegal business of prominent people who are behind the illegal logging activities in the province
4889411 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4889412 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4889413 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4889414 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years
4889415 a remarkable indictment of the corruption and cynicism rife among climate scientists
4889416 if nothing is done all the polar bears could die in our lifetime
4889417 science keeps getting stronger and the mathematical models keep getting better
4889418 there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable future cause catastrophic heating of the earths atmosphere and disruption of the earths climate
4889419 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4889420 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4889421 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4889422 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4889423 miss ive got a free spin card with your name on it
4889424 hi im regis philbin can i buy you a drink
4889425 im sorry but i cannot accept get lost game show boy unless its phrased in the form of a question
4889426 the truth is the truth and thats how the president will testify
4889427 if a man wants his dreams to come true he must wake up
4889428 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university
4889429 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4889430 if you wanted to attack the u s bring us to our knees you wouldnt even have to come here
4889431 the largest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
4889432 we send it to a few friends and we send it to the people who dont like us very well
4889433 and im convinced were paying for both sides of the war
4889434 i think this is so important to the country that if he wanted to meet at midnight sunday night id go
4889435 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4889436 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4889437 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4889438 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4889439 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4889440 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4889441 global warming obesity and heart disease all figments of al gores imagination
4889442 we used to be young but suddenly were not our thighs have gone wide but we used to be hot wubyah wubyah wubyah
4889443 how i stopped raising my children and started raising h
4889444 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4889445 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4889446 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4889447 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4889448 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4889449 these solutions are flexible the student will be moving a few times throughout college and you want something that can be adjusted to different places
4889450 this gives them an outlet to share and discuss their passion on issues they care about
4889451 there are a lot of people who have a great deal of knowledge about living sustainable and environmental lifestyles within the county
4889452 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4889453 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4889454 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
4889455 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4889456 to be able to eat a typical peking duck gives the athletes the most enjoyment
4889457 every day i think i had it for breakfast the other day
4889458 i get so tired and i dont feel like eating any of the other dishes i eat some duck drink some rice porridge and take off
4889459 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4889460 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4889461 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4889462 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4889463 its really the story of humanitys struggle to exist in an environment undergoing severe changes
4889464 the larger the island of knowledge the longer the shoreline of wonder
4889465 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4889466 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4889467 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4889468 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4889469 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4889470 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4889471 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4889472 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck
4889473 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4889474 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4889475 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4889476 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4889477 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4889478 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4889479 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4889480 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4889481 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4889482 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4889483 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4889484 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4889485 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4889486 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4889487 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4889488 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4889489 supports privatization tax cuts and government spending cuts and opposes laws that limit spending by non party organizations during election campaigns
4889490 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4889491 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4889492 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4889493 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4889494 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4889495 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4889496 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4889497 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4889498 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4889499 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4889500 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4889501 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4889502 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4889503 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy
4889504 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4889505 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4889506 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4889507 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4889508 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4889509 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4889510 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4889511 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4889512 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4889513 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4889514 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4889515 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4889516 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4889517 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4889518 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4889519 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4889520 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4889521 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4889522 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4889523 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4889524 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4889525 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4889526 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4889527 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4889528 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4889529 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4889530 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4889531 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4889532 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4889533 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4889534 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4889535 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4889536 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4889537 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4889538 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4889539 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4889540 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4889541 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4889542 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4889543 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4889544 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4889545 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4889546 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4889547 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4889548 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4889549 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4889550 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4889551 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4889552 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4889553 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4889554 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4889555 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4889556 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4889557 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4889558 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4889559 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4889560 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4889561 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4889562 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4889563 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4889564 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4889565 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4889566 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4889567 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4889568 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4889569 who are open to doing something on the production side
4889570 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4889571 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4889572 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4889573 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4889574 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4889575 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4889576 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4889577 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4889578 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4889579 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4889580 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4889581 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4889582 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4889583 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4889584 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4889585 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4889586 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4889587 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4889588 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4889589 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4889590 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4889591 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4889592 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4889593 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4889594 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4889595 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4889596 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4889597 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4889598 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4889599 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4889600 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4889601 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4889602 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4889603 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4889604 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4889605 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4889606 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
4889607 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4889608 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4889609 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
4889610 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
4889611 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
4889612 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
4889613 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
4889614 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4889615 they were all our first choices everyone said yes which is so rare
4889616 our motto has been get the story right get the facts right tell it honestly
4889617 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4889618 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4889619 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4889620 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4889621 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4889622 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4889623 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4889624 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4889625 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4889626 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4889627 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4889628 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4889629 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4889630 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4889631 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4889632 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4889633 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4889634 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4889635 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4889636 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4889637 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4889638 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4889639 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4889640 i was told internally by people in the police department that they were ordered not to investigate the photos
4889641 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
4889642 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
4889643 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
4889644 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
4889645 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
4889646 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
4889647 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
4889648 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
4889649 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
4889650 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4889651 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4889652 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4889653 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4889654 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4889655 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4889656 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4889657 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4889658 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4889659 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4889660 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4889661 the newly created lockup is on the northeast side of denver
4889662 were concerned about how thats going to be utilized by people who will be potentially disruptive
4889663 its good to know you dont have a problem with gitmo type incarcerations and treatment unless they go on for years i agree just not on american citizens in an american city
4889664 especially those who got stuck there because somebody had a personal grudge or got a monetary bounty for pointing the finger at them gimme a call
4889665 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4889666 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4889667 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4889668 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4889669 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4889670 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4889671 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4889672 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4889673 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4889674 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4889675 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4889676 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4889677 i thought i told you not to do that for fear that this might happen
4889678 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4889679 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4889680 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4889681 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4889682 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4889683 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4889684 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4889685 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4889686 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4889687 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4889688 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4889689 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4889690 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4889691 the picture is completely absolutely 100 percent on schedule on time there were no delays
4889692 ive seen the movie it is fabulous we would have been perfectly able to have it out in november
4889693 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4889694 we agreed at the security organ that the agreement should be signed within the period of the summit

4889701 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
4889702 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
4889703 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
4889704 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
4889705 i didnt ask to come here i didnt ask to be put on some bull shit drugs to make me feel better about myself and i sure as hell dont need some gay psychiatrist telling me i need more so i dont commit suicide
4889706 alright thats fine if you dont want to be here youre perfectly welcome to leave you dont have to come back and well both be happy

4889709 few choices on the menu stellas knows what it does best
4889710 we respect them a lot like they do to us
4889711 firstly we will watch the videos to see how brazil play and then we will draw our conclusions we respect them a lot and i believe they are worried about facing argentina even though we feel the same about brazil
4889712 we both had gruelling quarter final matches that lasted 120 minutes the team that recovers both mentally and physically will play in the final
4889713 we came to the olympics with the objective of defending the gold medal and we hope that this will be achieved
4889714 thanks to luck we received an important triumph but we did create lots of opportunities in front of goal that we didnt convert
4889715 i still believe we were more superior than the dutch it was hard but i am happy with the current state of the team
4889716 i look at this as being a tossup i couldnt tell you who is going to win
4889717 anybody who is on the ballot and pulling 40 percent of the vote is a serious candidate
4889718 i think he would put up walls and thats not what we need right now
4889719 i think a lot of his colleagues may dismiss him
4889720 redners role will not necessarily be winning but being a spoiler by damaging democrats in the process
4889721 incredible if he isnt the greatest olympian ever who is
4889722 for best olympic torch lighting moment id have to go with the 94 lillehammer games
4889723 well sue them for all its worth they will not get away with this
4889724 i dont care how much money we can get for this what about what they said about me one magazine accused me of doing drugs they said that i was a spazzed out mess who will soon join lindsey and paris on the road to nowhere
4889725 but more importantly what about matt i made him look like a total jerk hes really a nice guy and i treated him like a jerk
4889726 honey thats the last of your problems now what about that interview on ellen you can use that to clear up the rumors
4889727 im sorry sara ive had a few drinks i should not have called
4889728 its ok ethan but i thought that we went over all of this the other week im with jason now and while its true that what we had was very special you have to let me go i cant keep getting these phonecalls at one in the morning ok
4889729 i dont know but to tell the truth it isnt that bad being stuck in here
4889730 haley i know its your first day here and i know ive only known you for a little while but i really do like you
4889731 do you want to kiss me as much as i want to kiss you
4889732 well done my child enter into the joy of the lord
4889733 i was trying to achieve the impossible because the amount of training that i did wasnt enough
4889734 my legs have just gone i didnt do all that work for nothing but its just frustrating
4889735 the other half are going to tear this apart on how we won this race but i got the trophy and i got the points
4889736 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks couple of road courses pocono it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4889737 it would be good to get another win to show everybody we can do it on a full tank of gas
4889738 it would be a good to get a win anywhere but michigan is a good place because of the manufacturers being close being close to detroit motor city
4889739 get mad because you dont want to save you just want to run hard
4889740 it is a lot of work and you dont know if what you are doing is saving gas or not you dont know what you are accomplishing and its no fun
4889741 the first thing i need to know is how much fuel do we need to save
4889742 you cant tell the driver to save fuel with five laps to go in the race the information has to be fed to a driver as soon as that run starts
4889743 look were on the edge here the only way to save fuel is to go slower you de accelerate sooner youre off the throttle sooner youre on the throttle later and youre on the throttle less aggressively
4889744 by the way you still have to make reasonable lap times in most cases
4889745 were just trying to get better and we did definitely improve on road courses
4889746 but these bigger tracks we still are it seems like always about two or three laps less than what everyone else is im not a fan of the fuel mileage races i like the fastest car winning i dont think the fans like a crew chief race i think they like to see a drivers race
4889747 it depends on what side of the fence you are on man
4889748 if you are on the winning side you are happy dont matter how if you are the guy who had the fastest car all day you arent real happy about it
4889749 i have been on both sides of it everybody would like to just go out there and just outrun the hell out of everybody to win races sometimes you have to take them how you get them
4889750 i dont know what you guys are waiting for because we didnt get anything in

4889752 i stopped that 64 degree wedge on the last hole a dime pretty much thank goodness i had that club in my bag
4889753 then after jordan and i both missed putts on the first playoff hole i made a putt on the second to win
4889754 i struggled coming down the back nine but pulled it out in the end when it mattered
4889755 i thought after the first few holes it was going to be a great round but then a few missed putts and it was tough it was a battle out there today im so happy to win but wish i could have played a little better
4889756 all i wanted to do coming here was make the junior ryder cup and i did that
4889757 i played a consistent round with no bogeys and that is definitely what i wanted to do i would have liked for a couple of more putts to drop and i left a couple short too
4889758 this is the biggest tournament that i have ever won
4889759 it is especially good because i was in the lead all four days i am usually coming from behind when i win so it is nice to win when i have been in front of everyone else
4889760 i was telling myself to be patient all day and the putts finally started dropping and i extended the lead
4889761 i came here to get into the junior ryder cup winning the junior pga championship was a huge bonus
4889762 anytime you get to represent your country and play in the junior ryder cup it is an honor

4889785 i was pretty good myself back in the day too bad theres no way to prove such a claim
4889786 i wasnt worried about the world record i didnt know it until id done my victory lap
4889787 when i ran the earlier round i felt the world record because its a new track its fast but i came out here just to win im so happy for myself and my country
4889788 i had to play it safe i couldnt play silly beggars and go chasing world records
4889789 its been a long build up it always is for the olympic games but then it comes round so quickly
4889790 im just pleased its over this is just the first one of three
4889791 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday night
4889792 i knew at the beginning of the week it was going to be a low scoring week just because you have a lot of wedges eight irons and nine irons and the two par fives are very reachable
4889793 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
4889794 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
4889795 i dont know how to sum it up its just beyond expectations and its a day well remember for a long time
4889796 im very emotional but im trying to keep a cap on it because ive got another race to go
4889797 and after the kilo was dropped after athens there were parts of me thinking that it could be the end of my individual career
4889798 i actually thought i had lost the race right there but i guess that was the difference in the end
4889799 when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the 1 next to my name thats when i let my roar out
4889800 i really dont know what to say i guess ive had the perfect situations all week
4889801 i was shocked at the end it was kind of a little bit of a delayed reaction
4889802 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off to make sure the 1 was next to my name
4889803 i just have one race left the relay and then its done
4889804 i hope we can work something out to make sure you arent led astray on this occasion

4889822 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature
4889823 i am really looking forward to playing for a team that has such an incredible history and well known and passionate supporters
4889824 the club has enjoyed great success in recent years winning titles and cups in scotland and doing well in the champions league
4889825 it really is a tremendous honour to sign for a club of celtics stature

4889829 rafa benitez arrived in england at the same time as i did and is beginning his fifth year at the club
4889830 it has been the same group of players and the same management structure for the past four years
4889831 weaknesses are exposed in that time frame and dealt with
4889832 it is impossible to win the championship without a world class goalkeeper and a world class striker and liverpool have both
4889833 i say to my friend capello terry is a good choice a very good choice
4889834 we have been trying to add to the squad but nothing has changed i have nothing else to say
4889835 i absolutely cant believe that has happened i knew when i touched i had won and that was a great thing because i was just going for gold
4889836 i didnt expect that record at all it has always been a goal of mine but i never really expected it at this moment in time
4889837 to do it now and to do that time it hasnt sunk in yet
4889838 i will try to be very clear over the barry situation everyone has been talking and it seems that the blame is put on me
4889839 i get blamed for everything for global warming to high petrol prices
4889840 but in this case i want to be very clear since i talked to martin oneill about the situation in april i have not talked to anyone at aston villa
4889841 so if anyone wants to talk about barry in the future they must talk with the owner rick parry liverpool chief executive or the chief executive of aston villa and as i have said those talks i understand have been good
4889842 i was not involved in the talks about barry i was not involved in the talks about xabi alonso and arsenal

4889849 for many evangelical leaders rick warren is either a little too naive or a little too shrewd
4889850 he is threatening to water down the essential message of evangelical christianity
4889851 and that is what causes people to grow a little insecure and concerned and maybe even disconcerted

4889853 in essence what were going to do is bring everyone to the table and say weve identified you and were going to give you two paths to go down
4889854 we would prefer you to take this path where we have some resources in place for you to use and people who genuinely want to help you and change your lifestyle or youre going to go down this path where were going to target you and its going to be one where youll end up in jail and possibly in jail for a very long time
4889855 you already have them on the list and youre just waiting for them to trip and then you move on them
4889856 i certainly dont want to be part of an effort that gives the parents nor these young men false expectations that we have a safety net there
4889857 as a neighborhood preacher i am tired of the only phone calls i get is when a young man has been killed or a young woman is shot and they need a preacher

4889901 traditional perspectives on workforece success which often focus on standardization and cost reduction have little to do with the demands of successful strategy execution
4889902 successful strategies and competitive advantage nearly always rely on some form of differention in the marketplace yet traditional workforce strategies are remarkaly undifferentiated both within and across firms that is we often see firms with very different organizational strategies adopting highly similar workforce strategies
4889903 an organization where hr professionals are solely focused on operational efficiency and administrative compliance can never fully capture the strategic value of its workforce
4889904 for many years workforce measurement has primarly consisted of measuring activities associated with hr transactions and of improving the performance of those elements as a result managers quite often focus on the wrong measures and even if those measures could be driven to zero it would have little or no influence on the successful execution of the firms strategy
4889905 the emphasis on workforce differentiation breaks the traditional disconnect between the logic of differentiation at the level of corporate strategy and the tendency toward homogeneity or commonality in workforce management
4889906 measures of wokforce performance or contribution to firm performance must reflect that indirect line of sight between the workforce and the firms financial success
4889907 the right workforce performance measures follow directly from the strategic role of the workforce in executing your firms strategy
4889908 the key element of this approach are the need to move from viewing people and people management systems as a cost to be minimized to viewing them as a primary source of competitive advantage here we introduce the concept of
4889909 we believe that is only after you are clear about the strategic objectives and workforce capabilities that you can effectively develop a workforce scorecard thus
4889910 the last player we will want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner mike ashley and myself and i am sure he will not be leaving st james park
4889911 if you look over the years at the type of player harry has successfully brought in i think im that type too
4889912 i think i can bring some intensity and some flair and i want to make harry look like a smart man again for bringing me to the club
4889913 the players are professionals and there is no doubt they are hurt by what happened at macclesfield
4889914 i was sure that i would feature in upcoming crucial games after overcoming the injury worries before our first match
4889915 then it was like hell for me because when i tried to sprint i felt a sharp pain in my kneecap
4889916 the last player we will want to sell is james milner and i am talking about the owner mike ashley and myself and i am sure he will not be leaving st james park
4889917 i am looking forward to this game we got beat at home to plymouth three seasons ago so it will be a good opportunity to put that straight
4889918 it was my first professional english game and i only started because of injuries to other players we got beat which wasnt nice but it was a great experience and i was happy with the way it went apart from losing
4889919 even if we had won that game no one could have imagined what was going to happen
4889920 i see jimmy in training every day and i see him working very hard at his game i see him very focused and committed to the team so these things dont really tie up
4889921 i havent had any conversations with him since alistair macintosh made it clear that we dont want to be discussing at the moment new contracts for players who have at least two years left on their current ones
4889922 we would rather concentrate on improving our squad and seeing how that improvement pans out then maybe as the contracts go further into their term there will be time for readjustment
4889923 i dont really understand the arguments because if people are trying to suggest jimmy bullard is unhappy then that is not the case
4889924 he is getting on with his work professionally he perhaps didnt get what he wanted to make him the happiest person but im sure he fully understands the situation
4889925 he is not a player we would want to lose at all but we have to be realistic about things
4889926 ryans trained with the second group this week but i didnt risk him for that behind closed doors practice game adam was terrific on tuesday
4889927 weve just got to be careful with adam yes he might play depending on ryan but he might not and if he doesnt play it will be nothing to do with his performance i thought he was very very good the longer the game went the better he was getting
4889928 it looks as if hes got a slight strain in his calf he obviously looks quite doubtful for the weekend
4889929 ive got a point to prove like everyone else down here and to have the fire back in your belly is a nice feeling
4889930 everyone wants to play at the top level and its all about expressing yourself and enjoying it given the chance
4889931 if we want to go out and play like we did in the first half at luton im not going to come out and watch the game
4889932 if we give reading chances like we did to luton i can assure you they are the type of team who will plunder you
4889933 there were so many fouls in the game in training yesterday that if i had stopped play every time we would never have finished it they would have been taking free kicks all day
4889934 the annoying thing for me is people are starting to appreciate they have got to stick their foot in now rather than later
4889935 its terrible to say it but maybe the defeat at luton will be a benefit it might have given people the realism they need
4889936 but of course we do offer an independent monetary policy in this country and of course i think its all pretty simple when the official interest rate goes down if it goes down then borrowing costs should follow its really that simple
4889937 as reserve bank assistant governor philip lowe said earlier in the week the banks have simply no excuse no excuse at all to not follow the official cash rate down
4889938 we do live in a market economy and we do live in a democratic country where we respect the importance and the stability of both fiscal policy and monetary policy
4889939 so of course when the reserve acts independently to put rates up that does put a lot of pain on households ultimately on businesses and it also puts a bit of a handbrake on the economy
4889940 so i think the public have got a right to expect that when official rates come down then rates set by the banks come down as well
4889941 i had talked with him earlier in the day and he said he would turn his stuff in
4889942 he offered to resign before i said anything to him
4889943 at this time i dont feel its appropriate to comment on a pending case
4889944 yesterday was one of the hardest days of my career
4889945 we have a 116 000 increase in our fuel costs alone this year and then we gave a 3 5 percent raise which i think cost us nearly 300 000
4889946 other than that bits and pieces of everything else added up to all of that but were in very good shape our fund balance is very good and our beginning fund balance will be about 5 million
4889947 theres no way we could have known the price of energy this year last year so we really dont know but we hope not were going to try not to
4889948 were improving in all areas no matter that we didnt get the recognized rating
4889949 our elementary is one sub population away from exemplary we know what to do weve just got to get there
4889950 we should be able to get some of our classes started in that facility
4889951 i think our english and social studies classes will be able to meet the expected completion is somewhere around thanksgiving whether well make the move or not im saying by the new year well be in the whole thing

4889956 i see mission and vision as artefact concepts which are deliberately used to create purposeful collective action they do so by making gaps visible
4889957 vision definetely is in the time domain about the future it implies a gap between an imagined future state and the present state mission is not related to time in the same manner instead mission is related to what value creating domain we participate in and how i e what role we have in what larger system this definition of mission also means that mission can but not necessarily imply a gap between the present state and some desired state
4889958 so mission is a description of what differences our existence makes to the context we function in whereas vision defines a gap between the present and some future state vision always implies a gap mission may imply the existence of a gap but doesnt have to
4889959 but vision does not have to imply mission mission always implies reasoning in terms of what effects you have on the external world and its betterment vision may be about effects on the external world but it may also be only about the state of our own organization for example its size its profitability its competence how it makes its shareholders rich how it gains power
4889960 all visions are about the future all missions are about the effects on the external world
4889961 why are vision and mission interesting conceptual artefacts because of the inherent importance of gaps and of meaning and purpose to create individual and collective action in human beings probably the most important atractor equivalent in social systems is meaning in complexity theory atractor means some sort of principle or magnetic field which can serve to bring the energy of many seemigly disparate elements and actions to move in some particular direction when suddenly the system acquires qualities beyond those of its elements this happens normally when a compex system reaches a fracture point in which it takes on a different logic moving towards a different state of organization and structure
4889962 visionary leaders who did not formulate a vision about a mission wil be much more quickly forgotten

4889969 another research service study indicated that despite the consolidation of american agriculture tiny farms were holding their own the number of farms with annual sales of more than 250 000 in inflation adjusted dollars nearly doubled to 152 000 in 2002 from 85 000 in 1982 the survey showed o neg cio do pre o da produ o em massa while midsize and small farms with revenue ranging from 10 000 to 250 000 declined operations with sales of less than 10 000 jumped 14 percent over those years to 2 5 million from 2 2 million the reports authors cautioned though that technical changes in its methodology exaggerated the increase
