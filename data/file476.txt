4760014 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4760015 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4760016 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4760017 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4760018 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4760047 god has always had his specialists who appeared at critical moments in history to reprove rebuke and exhort in the name of god and righteousness such a man was likely to be drastic radical possibly at times violent and the curious crowd that gathered to watch him work soon branded him as extreme fanatical and negative and in a sense they were right he was single minded severe and fearless because these were the qualities the circumstances demanded

4760054 a programme must be developed with appropriate incentives given to encourage barbadians living overseas to market our country
4760055 remittances from overseas barbadians have grown from 64 million in 1992 to 263 million in 2006 your investment has created jobs new housing as well as business
4760056 new york has over 200 000 barbadians and canada has over 20 000 we also have organizations in bermuda st thomas and tortola globally there are more barbadians living outside the island that inside

4760059 over the years there was always something wrong when the olympics came around i am here this time to take something from beijing id love to be among the medals
4760060 i specifically indicated why i was going to iceland i thought that was very important because i didnt want anybody to be mistaken why i was going to iceland and there are two reasons why i am going
4760061 i am not going to iceland because we have a problem or we did not do proper research at the beginning i am going to iceland for positive reasons and i want the public to be quite clear on that and let me finally say as far as this is concerned i like to define myself i think i can speak very well i dont need the opposition concerned citizens movement to define me they seem better defining me than doing the work they should have done in the last 14 years
4760062 you need to have an idea because it would not only mean more employment it would mean more need for schools perhaps more need for policing more need for recreational facilities things like those so if you have a place that went through that experience you would want to see what happened how it impacted n the population etc and how they coped with it and so that is why i am going to iceland
4760063 my presence was somewhat different in the sense that i gave a nevis perspective but we are going to have our own consultation this year in october
4760064 what we have done in nevis and what we hope to do in nevis i specifically focused on the spike in crime that we had a few weeks ago and the immediate steps that we took and the long term steps that we have to take we discussed high prices and the measures that have been taken at the federal and local level i discussed geothermal that was very crucial to my presentation and what geothermal can do for both nevis and st kitts islands
4760065 some criminal deportees have fallen afoul of the law upon their return to the bahamas and present a challenge for law enforcement officers
4760066 the crime situation is grave and calls for an anti crime effort in which all of us must participate
4760067 the picture painted of crimes against the person particularly violent crime is a gloomy one
4760068 it also tells us that the motive for the vast majority of murders is retaliation or revenge
4760069 others stem from domestic violence and armed robbery we can conclude therefore that murder in the bahamas is not generally a random act
4760070 the picture the statistics paint of crime against property was equally as disturbing
4760071 while some crimes in this category are slightly down from last year the numbers continue to be too high
4760072 our spiralling crime rate is reflected in a significant prison population
4760073 as at todays date the inmate population of her majestys prison stood at 1 358 persons
4760074 of this number 626 are on remand and 732 are sentenced there are 1 312 males and 46 females incarcerated
4760075 originates in trans national criminal activities that violate our maritime territory
4760076 seizure figures underscore the yeoman service being rendered by the royal bahamas defence force and the royal bahamas police force in their efforts to keep illicit drugs and arms smuggling out of our islands
4760077 our financial institutions remain strong and investors local and foreign continue to place great confidence in the growth prospects of our federation
4760078 the kiawah group is still working steadfastly to expeditiously commence construction on the mandarin oriental hotel as the first phase of a comprehensive development project that will transform the entire southeast peninsula into a world class tourism development capable of competing with any similar development on the face of the globe
4760079 indeed even the global experts seem unsure as to how long the global credit crisis and the resulting economic slowdown will last hence we cannot be certain that we will not be affected even more severely if these global problems are prolonged we must therefore devise strategies aimed at mitigating to a significant degree the risk associated with the tumultuous changes in the global environment
4760080 in particular we must continue to strengthen the public finances with a view to bringing down debt and thereby enhancing the capacity of the government to promote growth accelerate social development and cope with natural disasters
4760081 we must find alternative sources of energy to protect electricity consumers and other users of energy from the unnerving fluctuations in oil prices in global markets
4760082 in a nutshell the global environment is changing rapidly and we must continue to embrace social and economic change as the means of coping with global developments
4760083 as testimony to our commitment to change our recent cabinet reshuffle has sought to ensure that new perspectives are brought to bear on some of the critical issues that affect us including public finance national security labour information and technology foreign affairs and social development
4760084 we will be taking extensive notes of the deliberations and we can assure you that many of the views expressed here will make their way into various government policy documents including the annual budget and the medium term strategy paper indeed we have brought forward the national consultations this year to give the ministry of finance as well as other line ministries adequate time to analyse and evaluate the ideas and views expressed here and to ensure that they are reflected in all subsequent deliberations in relation to the 2009 budget and related policy documents
4760085 external shocks and changes in the international environment our analysis and response
4760086 the selection of this topic signifies that governments strategic planning process is designed to deal with the current realities of our economy we believe that proper analysis and planning puts us in a favourable position to deal with issues of our development in an appropriate manner
4760087 we are not looking to make alterations just for the sake of it but we are looking for solutions that will bring benefit to our people
4760088 today we will focus on how we can use all our resources especially the abundance of human and social capital which we possess to treat with the circumstances with which we are confronted
4760089 these include the rising cost of oil and its cascading impact on the prices of other commodities the rising cost of food as a result of increased demand and the trend in developed countries to use grain as an alternative source of energy global commodity inflation global credit crises pressures on fiscal systems to deal with rising prices and the changes in the way aid is now being delivered
4760090 i believe that based on past record there can be no doubt in your minds and in the minds of all citizens and residents of st kitts and nevis as to this governments commitment to dialogue and the consultative process we view your presence here today as an indication of your faith in this process that is the partnership between the public and private sectors which ensures that the policies of government receive the necessary ownership in order that the intended outcomes may be achieved
4760091 in europe we have much to gain from a further opening of global trade we are highly competitive knowledge based and innovative we are the largest economy in the world we are the biggest exporters our economies and our living standards which depend on economic success need open world markets
4760092 72 of the bahamas foreign currency earnings come from services and 85 of this is from tourism and offshore banking fees that do not need an epa 83 of exports of goods go to the us and canada and only 13 to the eu so merchandise exports to the eu provides just 4 of the bahamas total export earnings there are probably other people who will buy bahamas crawfish if the eu wants to charge an 8 tariff on the other hand bahamas will be giving up tariff revenues on eu imports an additional 49 to be zero rated within 15 years and 5 in years 15 25 on top of the 32 already duty free
4760093 how will the government recoup these tax revenues which other taxes will go up what will be the cost of the change over to the government to businesses if the govt doesnt recoup all the revenue what expenditure will be cut education health security
4760094 one of the primary goals of the council is to establish better efficiencies through broad based cooperative efforts and collaborative agreements
4760095 the structure that we have in place will allow us to utilize the talents and resources of the various agencies of the v i government to address specific issues together and in an integrated system that can then be leveraged with the private sector and non profit organizations towards providing better quality and more effective services to children and families in the territory
4760096 we are trying to provide the best services possible for our children however gaps occur across our departments and children unfortunately fall between the cracks i see a window of opportunity for parents children and families that closes very quickly if we arent able to address their issues especially those with special needs
4760097 i think its crucial that we work for the rights of children and its important that we are the voice of our children we need to be there to protect their rights and to make sure that they have a healthy and happy life in the territory
4760098 the tone and content of their recommendations will no doubt lead to a more onerous and rigorous environment for financial institutions whilst banks operating in so called secrecy jurisdictions may lose one of their strongest selling points
4760099 the ramifications for all offshore financial institutions may be significant particularly in jurisdictions which like switzerland have banking secrecy laws rather than the more widely accepted rules on banking confidentiality
4760100 this internal document shows that there were persons in the party recognizing the same issues that we were
4760101 it may be an old document but it shows that misick listens to no one
4760102 while acknowledging the need for the construction of a new facility the law enforcement agencies will require a lot of that funding which would have been otherwise used for the construction of such facility
4760103 as an alternative for that what is intended is that we are going to make use of the lands that were selected for the prison farm what we want to do there is to construct a facility to house up to 50 or 60 inmates who we consider to be well behaved
4760104 weve got to win our last three and thats one of them down
4760105 we hung in well tackling was a lot better tonight we probably lacked a bit of polish at times but showed a lot of heart
4760106 weve had a lot of close losses over the past few weeks but thatll give us some confidence
4760107 its been pretty flat around the club at the moment and to win that is awesome
4760108 i put the usa at the back of the fleet but coming downwind the race committee decided to abandon the race it was very frustrating to me
4760109 it was a game we had to win to keep our hopes alive we knew it would come right down to the wire
4760110 it is a little sore but it should be fine in the next week
4760111 we are trying to get of the bottom of the table we have set ourselves a goal there and are hoping to achieve that
4760112 croatia right now is playing their best water polo and for us to beat them and control this game today shows that were definitely in contention for a gold medal
4760113 i wondered what i was going to say at this monumental time when it would happen and who i would say it to and of course i thought i was going to say it to you phelps for some time now
4760114 the word comes to mind epic what you did tonight was epic i never thought for one moment you were out of that race
4760115 you represent such an inspiration to youngsters around the world
4760116 as soon as i took the last half stroke to be honest i thought i had lost the race
4760117 and that was the difference cause if i would have glided then i would have come up short ive been lucky enough over the last four years to have two pretty good finishes in olympic finals i guess im blessed
4760118 we have eight young men arrested the arrests have taken place between thursday night and today they are under custody in connection with these crimes but with no charges so far
4760119 we cannot divulge the charges at this stage it is very sensitive and may put others on their guard so the information we gave is all we can give at this stage
4760120 nothing has changed since the november 15 2007 memorandum issued by omb director debra gottlieb
4760121 closing a dark chapter in denmarks role as colonial power on the islands
4760122 closing this dark chapter all by themselves denmark once again has conveyed to the people of the virgin islands arrogance ignorance of the issues and a gross insensitivity which we must address
4760123 government house policy regarding reparations in the territory will be forthcoming in a few weeks
4760124 protesting the irresponsibility and the neglect of the reparations issue by the usvi government
4760125 land ownership and the construction of carib identity in st
4760126 land was the principal element in the creation of caribs as caribs
4760127 still on the fringes a survey of the conditions of living in the carib community
4760128 we are getting mixed up with the garifuna all of us are classified as garifuna which is wrong
4760129 we want to ensure that we develop and implement labour policies to effectively manage the human resource needs in the territory while at the same time recognizing those persons who have demonstrated a long term commitment to the territory
4760130 i am very happy this afternoon to stand here before you with this truck in the background it is a brand new truck which has been brought here by the nevis island administration we decided to spend the money we decided we wanted to have a truck to bring the services up to grade five so that the airport can be opened at all times we have ensured today that the american eagle would land at anytime once the eagle wishes to come to nevis and to this airport
4760131 these men have worked very hard very long hours and they have given dedicated service to this island of nevis and since we are speaking of these men and many of them are kittitians i want to the people of nevis both men and women to join the fire services
4760132 at least you do not have to worry about guns you are doing a service where the public is behind you the public is supportive of you and they need more people they need more hands contact the officer in charge of nevis and talk to the officer in charge in st kitts because we really need to make sure that we can keep our airport safe
4760133 this government is all about training we have dedicated ourselves to education and training because we know that is the key to upward mobility and the key to development
4760134 the problem is for some reason many persons are running away from chemistry physics and mathematics they dont have the basic subjects to do these courses that is the problem that we face at this moment so i am now appealing to the parents to work on the children to pay attention to mathematics and on the sciences so that we can have more persons to train in these areas in the mean time we continue to train our people it will be for the benefit of our country
4760135 this piece of equipment is a symbol for future growth in nevis
4760136 this is a great opportunity for everybody here in nevis not only will it help support your airport and continue your growth it also expands the way for future fire trucks for your new fire department as you grow and we look forward to working with you on those projects as well
4760137 jayson fouled it off and it hit him in the eye
4760138 hes in bad shape theres a lot of blood inside and outside of the eye
4760139 im not accustomed to throwing at people its not good
4760140 as pitchers we just try to get the batter out
4760141 im really not in favor of a guy squaring around to hit the ball and a guy throwing it right at his head
4760142 its hard to get out of the way of that pitch
4760143 in my wildest imagination i didnt think they would throw right at his coconut
4760144 they said it was swelling with a lot of bleeding
4760145 no game of baseball is worth that as far as im concerned
4760146 it shows a lack of respect on the part of the american manager to say that lazo deliberately hit nix
4760147 it would be one thing if the ball hit him in the head first but it hit the bat then hit him in the face
4760148 we would never make a personal attack because we are professional players some things just cannot be controlled cubans respect their team and respect the game we are incapable of doing something like that
4760149 i just dont like it played that way and me losing a player ive lost him probably for the rest of the series
4760150 in the format throwing at guys in that situation i dont think its the place for it
4760151 this is tremendous news the fact 10 member unions have signalled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4760152 five of the six irb regions are represented with italy jamaica and russia signalling an interest to tender for a rugby world cup for the first time
4760153 there are many injured and we are still removing bodies from the scene
4760154 im not running for the money im running for the glory
4760155 it wasnt as easy as i wanted it to be to qualify
4760156 i wanted to run outside and not to get boxed in i was counting the spots and all i wanted was top five and i didnt want to go crazy theres always a worry in the final 100m and with five ahead of you
4760157 the concern was always raised as to whether or not the social services structures as they now exist can facilitate that process successfully and of course the answer is no they are weak they are overworked perhaps there is need for staff training and so on a lot of needs have been identified
4760158 the next thing we want to do is to look at performance indicators and the performance indicators will be the evaluating tool that people will use to know that yes i am on track or i am not on track and what do i need to do to get back on track
4760159 i must say that this is an excellent project and we are certainly working together to ensure that it is successful because the rest of the caribbean can certainly learn something from this historic piece of work in the oecs i know that people want to see this change so they will make themselves available so that they can give all the necessary information that is needed
4760160 we talked about institutional strengthening and we talked about building on their capacity that would actually entail some form of training one of the things we need to do is sensitize the practitioners of the new model legislation there is also the need for an integrated legal system and the social services support so that the two work in sync to deliver a better quality of product for clients families and children in the oecs
4760161 we just had an update on the condition of one of the girls that was airlifted from melfort to saskatoon and its been confirmed that one of them has passed away through the night
4760162 were small and close knit so were doing whatever needs to be done
4760163 whether its supporting the families providing food financial assistance counselling were looking into everything
4760164 they figure it could be early next week before they put that stuff together
4760165 once thats analyzed hopefully that will give us a little more information
4760166 were at the low level right now and its going to take time
4760167 if that means trying to get it right with six seven or eight sports i would rather do that than try to go too wide
4760168 beijing is an indicator of what the gap is between us and our competitors
4760169 we do need to take a look at strategic investments in some of those sports where we could put in 300 000 or 400 000 and get some results
4760170 australia did it all the time in archery for example but we have to have the right information
4760171 if we dont have the expertise in canada then we need to go overseas and get them there but we have to be careful that we dont say were going to pay a coach a huge salary and then not give him the tools to do the job
4760172 ive come from a system where often in the early days so many services were pushed on sport they didnt know which ones were the important ones
4760173 i do believe we shouldnt be here just to participate
4760174 ive never believed in just making the national team and being happy and satisfied with that
4760175 if our athletes are here there should be a realistic chance to get to the podium
4760176 its never time to modify the medal projection until the gun goes at the end of the games
4760177 were not even halfway into the games right now and were a second half team
4760178 theres our bubble as we call it and we try to stay in that as much as we can
4760179 we dont read comments we dont read forums we dont read all the websites nothing like that
4760180 you dont want to get brought down by negativity we all want to be that one to win the first medal because thats pretty awesome but were all doing the best we can
4760181 we had hoped the operator would comply with the moe order and clean up the exterior of the properties
4760182 at this time its critical for the city to do whatever is necessary so that these residents can resume some sense of normalcy in their neighbourhood after this traumatic event
4760183 hanno bisogno di trovare altri modi per fare i soldi
4760184 ogni ente deve essere responsabile di quello che spende tenendo conto dei soldi che ha e non di quelli che non ha
4760185 non sar una semplice reintroduzione dellici assicura il ministro per la semplificazione normativa ma preveder la soppressione delle oltre dieci tasse relative alla casa stato regione comune e la loro sostituzione con un tributo unico proprio a vantaggio dei comuni
4760186 una partecipazione del comune al gettito deliva prodotta sul territorio
4760187 si pu ragionevolmente ipotizzare la facolt per i comuni che abbiano particolari esigenze di bilancio di imporre una tassa sugli immobili ma questa deve essere decisa in piena autonomia dai sindaci e non essere imposta dautorit dal governo centrale
4760188 non possiamo dimenticare che vista la situazione economica internazionale e del debito pubblico nellimmediato la detassazione degli straordinari e labolizione dellici sulla prima casa sono gli interventi che il governo ha potuto fare nei confronti della pressione fiscale solo quando sar decollato in tutti i suoi aspetti il federalismo fiscale mette in chiaro che dovr comprendere una compensazione tra regioni forti e quelle deboli si potr riesaminare la questione dellici
4760189 stata stata sepolta e nessuno la resusciter il commento lapidario di tommaso foti dellesecutivo di alleanza nazionale e deputato pdl il governo berlusconi aveva promesso di abolirla nella sua prima riunione e cos stato
4760190 le sue parole sono vangelo rincara maurizio gasparri presidente dei senatori del pdl quella la linea e non c spazio per nessunaltra tesi in parlamento
4760191 nel governo regna la confusione sottolinea coordinatore del governo ombra del pd da un lato col documento di programmazione economica lesecutivo berlusconi programma un aumento della pressione fiscale costante nei prossimi cinque anni dallaltro rivendica come grande conquista labolizione dellici sulla prima casa ma poi bossi e una parte consistente della maggioranza annunciano lintenzione di reintrodurre lici mi sembra che il governo stia andando avanti a tentoni tutto il contrario di quella coerenza di cui fa gran vanto tremonti
4760192 la proposta di bossi di reintrodurre lici dimostra che il governo in un forte stato confusionale ed ha un atteggiamento schizofrenico rileva anche il capogruppo dellidv alla camera il leader del carroccio smaschera i trucchi del governo che per propaganda abolisce lici ma di fatto riduce i servizi essenziali per i cittadini
4760193 questo dietrofront di bossi rimarca donadi dimostra che il governo pensa pi a illudere i cittadini che a risolvere i problemi del paese

4760250 the best service we can render to the world is to live a holy separated life in the presence of the lord the more we grow in christ the more of christ we can receive the more of christ we receive the more the world can see and be benefited by the glory of god in us the christian who does not lead a holy separated life to the lord is of no value to god or man he is as salt that has lost its flavor
4760251 here is some info but according to what we have heard from several sources this is much more than just an emotional relationship according to staff and former staff members they claim that todd is a pathological liar the board privately has said that todd has been lying to them all along we are praying for those around todd to demand for him to get the help he needs before thrusting him back into ministry like they did 2 5 years ago when he had an affair with a different staff member we are praying for todd his family along with others that have been impacted through this

4760286 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4760287 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4760288 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4760289 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4760290 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4760291 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4760292 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4760293 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4760294 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4760295 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4760296 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4760297 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4760298 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4760299 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4760300 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4760301 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4760302 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4760303 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4760304 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4760305 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4760306 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4760307 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4760308 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4760309 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4760310 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4760311 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4760312 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4760313 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4760314 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4760315 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4760316 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4760317 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4760318 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4760319 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4760320 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4760321 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4760322 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4760323 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4760324 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4760325 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4760326 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4760327 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4760328 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4760329 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4760330 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4760331 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4760332 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4760333 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4760334 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4760335 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4760336 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4760337 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4760338 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4760339 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4760340 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4760341 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4760342 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4760343 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4760344 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4760345 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4760346 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4760347 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4760348 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4760349 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4760370 we will see on the pitch if he is motivated
4760371 non sporting circumstances can have an affect on players but i do not think that they will in his case
4760372 it would be difficult to make him not play well and if he is named in their team then we will have to watch him
4760373 neither team go into the game at 100 per cent of their capability
4760374 i think it is a great competition but we are only halfway through august and it is the first official game to see what level everyone is at
4760375 but both sides are still finding our rhtyhm and will still be lacking something i am sure
4760376 it is early but it is better to begin the season playing for a trophy this game is a reward for the hard work done last season when we won the copa del rey
4760377 despite not being at our best i know both teams will be highly motivated and will want to produce a good performance
4760378 thats my aim for this season and its the aim of the manager and all the players theres no question about that
4760379 if were going to get involved in the title race then the first thing we have to do is cut out the silly draws in games we should win
4760380 that happened too many times last season and it cost us too many points
4760381 we closed the gap last season and we finished in the top four again so that shows that were not that far away
4760382 but its not about closing the gap any more its about getting involved in the title race and staying there
4760383 ive said many times that i honestly dont think theres much between us and the other top sides whenever we play any of them we do well and we have outplayed all of them in certain games but far too often theyve managed to nick a sly goal that has got them the points
4760384 if you look at united it looks like theyre going to pay well over 20m on another striker and they also offered around 20m for a winger so lets not kid ourselves they are probably going to be stronger again
4760385 but we believe we are a good side too and if we perform as well as we can week in week out then ive got no doubt that we can be involved
4760386 it is a massive frustration for me just as it is for everyone who loves this club
4760387 im no different to the lads who go to the match every week in that i desperately want us to be challenging for the title and it does hurt me that it hasnt happened for so long
4760388 this is certainly the best moment of my life as we have got a gold medal for the country who was starving for a gold medal for more than hundred years i am proud of it as it shows that yes we can also win gold medals in the olympics

4760435 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4760436 it is unlikely that ossetians and abkhazians will be able to live with georgians in one state

4760471 the challenge of learning a new circuit is always exciting particularly when it is an unusual venue such as the new street circuit in valencia
4760472 despite preparing as much as we can in advance of the race our track walk with the engineers on thursday and the practice sessions on friday will be absolutely key to learning the track and assessing the grip levels

4760474 we have prepared well and i am looking forward to the weekend and the potential to score some points
4760475 we can expect the race weekend to be very hot which will add to the physical challenge for the drivers car and team

4760513 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
4760514 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
4760515 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have enormous damage in terms of manpower
4760516 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
4760517 the russians dont look kindly on the military cooperation of israeli firms with the georgian army and as far as i know israelis doing security consulting left georgia in the past few days because of the events there

4760523 the prestige of government has undoubtedly been lowered considerably by the prohibition law for nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced it is an open secret that the dangerous increase of crime in this country is closely connected with this

4760550 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4760551 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4760552 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4760553 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence

4760563 when things are going in the wrong direction people dont want to hit the accelerator with john mccain
4760564 they want a change and to start moving in the right direction
4760565 john mccain knows that ohio families are hurting and this latest news serves as a reminder that the next president will have to move quickly to get our economy back on the right track
4760566 thats why john mccain will keep taxes low and create incentives for small businesses to grow jobs
4760567 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations

4760571 its tough times when its a foreign entity coming in and sucker punching us thats how this felt
4760572 what i would like to get across is that mccain did come up to wilmington and had a private meeting with some business leaders and other people to see what he could do to save our jobs i certainly appreciate his current efforts to do what he can
4760573 not really an anti mccain statement but just to say that this is a tough time for a lot of us here
4760574 more frequent service additional peak off peak and weekend service and new late night regional rail service
4760575 this exciting expansion is dedicated to providing our existing customers with the transit service they expect and deserve service that is more convenient and designed to accommodate their needs
4760576 no doubt these new services will attract new customers to our already growing ridership but our prime purpose is to better serve our core customers
4760577 this wonderful expansion of septa service is a direct result of last years passage by the pennsylvania legislature of act 44 which provides long term predictable funding for state wide public transportation
4760578 we again express our appreciation to the many citizens and legislators who championed this historic legislation and especially governor rendell who made it a top priority and fought hard to assure its enactment

4760601 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4760602 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4760603 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4760604 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4760605 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4760606 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4760607 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4760609 we are going to have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4760610 i think chelsea have improved they have signed some good players they have got a new manager and they will be very hungry
4760611 they have got great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row so its going to be very tough this season
4760612 we are pleased overall but there is much more work to do
4760613 to bring students to grade level as many low income and minority students still lag behind academically
4760614 we did a good bit of revision in instruction looking at reinforcement of basic skills
4760615 at the current pace without significant intervention it would take 40 years for all of our 11th graders to meet state standards

4760619 they have responded very well they have taken greater ownership over their own education thats really exciting
4760620 were doing a great job and we will continue to get better
4760621 we say each individual child has to be accounted for and when a child is not getting it we say what are we going to do about it
4760622 its an effort to respond to the governors call for increased accountability and transparency so that people can see how the administrators in their districts are being compensated
4760623 the residents of new jersey are rightfully outraged at seeing their tax dollars used to provide departing superintendents with these offense payouts
4760624 from a school boards point of view you want to be careful with the tax dollars but you also want to attract quality school leadership hiring a superintendent is probably the most important decision a school board will make

4760640 i can confirm that there were two babies transferred up from the lethbridge regional hospital but flesh eating disease is a specific diagnosis and the organism was not isolated in either baby
4760641 they were both transferred up with significant infections but to say they are symptoms of flesh eating disease thats just alarmist kind of language
4760642 our involvement from the ministry is to see what is going on and theres been nothing to suggest a breach of proper infection control measures
4760643 we havent been able to find any reason why these babies developed the infection

4760659 rob grespinet is a heavy weight financial giant and most people will never be able to comprehend the level of connections this guy has
4760660 he will be teaching a simple technique he has been using over the years the technique takes 1 hour per day 5 days per week and it has made this guy millions
4760661 this is felix writing and if you know me you should know by now that i dont throw empty words into thin air
4760662 why am i eating im eating because you are why are you eating
4760663 i just had to kind of sit around it took a little time
4760664 you dont want to go out there and take it for granted
4760665 thats when you mess up like when the false start comes ive never false started in my life but it could have been that one time then im out in the first round and there go my chances
4760666 my coach wanted me to work on the blast at the beginning to get a feel for the track and if i felt good maintain it and if i cant shut it down
4760667 i was very pleased with the time because i havent been able to run races
4760668 usain asafa and tyson are really going to go at it i cant wait to watch it
4760669 they should have authorized a 1 billion buyback and they would use incremental cash flows to fund it
4760670 to pay a 10 cent dividend which is 30 million is nice but its not what we wanted
4760671 we believe a regular dividend will be positively viewed by shareholders and could perhaps attract a new set of equity investors the income investor
4760672 we wanted to keep their feet to the fire with regards to a buyback so they wouldnt make other acquisitions
4760673 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
4760674 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties
4760675 i think the employees at that particular location should be congratulated
4760676 i think no doubt whats happening at gatineau will be encouraging
4760677 our priority is to continue to run an efficient operation to ensure that we can fulfill our commitment to provide customers the everyday low prices they expect from wal mart
4760678 u s workers continue to wait to get the same respect from wal mart
4760679 if higher wages better benefits and fair treatment are incompatible with way of doing business its time for the company to change which is what wal mart watch has been saying all along
4760680 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4760681 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4760682 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4760683 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4760684 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4760685 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4760686 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4760687 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4760688 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4760689 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4760690 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4760691 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4760692 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4760693 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4760694 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4760695 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4760696 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4760697 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4760698 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4760699 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4760700 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4760701 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4760702 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4760703 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4760704 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession

4760721 we will go to arsenal in the first game and get them out of the way
4760722 at wembley we played a premier league team in portsmouth we played our own game and did really well
4760723 we dont want to be that nearly team again we want to go and do it this year if we have the same mentality we had against portsmouth then we will do alright
4760724 its a big ask for the three promoted teams to stay up this season
4760725 however sides like blackburn west ham newcastle and man city have all been nibbled at for relegation
4760726 whos to say they wont be joining the mini league of clubs scrapping it out at the bottom
4760727 if they focus on what bolt and powell can do they will seize up and it will affect their races

4760745 these judgments are a welcome wake up call to the state because it must make up its mind whether it intends to carry out the death penalty or not because it is cruel and inhumane to keep human beings in the agony of perpetual suspense and limbo with the death penalty hanging over their heads
4760746 it demonstrates complete mis management and mal administration of the whole death row system by the state
4760747 it is long overdue because all these condemned persons came within the ambit of the pratt v morgan principle and since the law holds that it is inhumane and illegal to execute someone where five years had elapsed from the date of conviction it follows that the death sentence should be commuted
4760748 i also sincerely hope that a great effort would be made to rehabilitate these persons and not leave them to rot in jail until they die
4760749 i take this opportunity to call on the powers that be to categorise murder into a first second and third degree and that the death penalty should be retained only for first degree murders

4760762 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and does not compete with stansted or luton or manchester
4760763 it competes with charles de gaulle in paris dubai now and amsterdams schiphol because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of the airports has nothing to do with competition
4760764 theres no serious research on the value of transfer passengers neither the government nor the studies on this have looked at the cost of the increase in pollution in the area around heathrow
4760765 weve been calling for the break up for a long time and the need has escalated every year
4760766 what we would really hope is for stansted to also be taken out of baa ownership it would be a token gesture to just sell gatwick

4760772 i would readily admit to intimidating someone else on purpose in fact id certainly intimidate someone else on your behalf but i would never knowingly do that to you
4760773 the fact that you are that way on my behalf is something i really appreciate about you and i know you arent that way with me on purpose so i just remind myself of that
4760774 its just beyond expectations and its a day well remember for a long time

4760976 our common battle cry is balance the budget and pay down the deficit
4760977 we have to debate it on every single issue debating certainly cuts down on wasteful spending
4760978 this congress has an opportunity to change the fiscal direction of our country
4760979 theres no doubt there will be tough choices to make as we live within this budget but americans are not afforded the luxury of living beyond their means and our government should stop doing so at the expense of our children and grandchildren

4761016 i was surprised and disappointed that the worlds media immediately took the side of georgian president mikheil saakashvili last week
4761017 the truth is that in this case russian aggression actually made some sense
4761018 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
4761019 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
4761020 nuclear power plants are unfinanceable in the private capital market because of their excessive costs and financial risks and the high uncertainty of both
4761021 during the nuclear revival now allegedly underway no new nuclear project on earth has been financed by private risk capital chosen by an open decision process nor bid into the worlds innumerable power markets and auctions no old nuclear plant has been resold at a value consistent with a market case for building a new one
4761022 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4761023 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4761024 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4761025 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4761026 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4761027 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4761028 this is a planning took where all things are going
4761029 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4761030 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4761031 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4761032 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4761033 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4761034 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4761035 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4761036 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4761037 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4761038 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4761039 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4761040 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4761041 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4761042 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4761043 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4761044 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4761045 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4761046 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4761047 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4761048 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4761049 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4761050 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4761051 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4761052 mexico is californias number one inbound market generating approximately 1 58 billion in spending so declines in that market would have a major impact on our economy including loss of jobs
4761053 in my role as national chair for the travel industry association im also concerned about what impeding travel would mean to the u s travel industry and economy just a five percent decline in overnight visitation from mexico would mean a loss of approximately 700 000 travelers and over 400 million in spending with a disproportionate impact on americas border states
4761054 the increase in business and leisure travel from mexico partially compensates for a decline of 2 million overseas visitors to the u s between 2000 and 2007
4761055 we must nurture and enhance this critical travel market through more efficient and secure travel systems and by combating a growing negative perception among mexican travelers that the u s has removed its welcome mat also our new requirements for u s citizens to provide passports in mexico have added a burden on mexican border states as well
4761056 inbound international travel is a leading american export providing a 17 4 billion trade surplus in 2007
4761057 just as the federal government is deeply involved in promoting trade with our neighbor to the south so too should it be involved in promoting travel to the united states
4761058 n o tenho nem id ia do peso que seria uma derrota a responsabilidade era enorme todo mundo sabe o que essa vit ria representa o campo n o ajudou o time deles forte mas entramos para vencer e isso o que importa o resultado
4761059 agora precisamos descan ar e pensar na semifinal o brasil lutou muito conseguiu o resultado todo mundo se esfor ou e est de parab ns mas agora teremos mais dois jogos pela frente
4761060 thats all in the past we have just got to look forward now
4761061 all those things which have happened the players who have injuries and the joey barton thing have been dealt with and we have just got to look forward and say this is where we are now
4761062 it is no good looking back and saying we have had no luck and things like that
4761063 we have to make our own luck and we have that chance now to take this club forward
4761064 obviously it is a tough game for us but it is still a good game for us
4761065 its an opportunity in work clothes we have to work tomorrow and we have to stick together you need a bit of luck to win any football match and you perhaps need a bit more sometimes at old trafford
4761066 now we have an opportunity to put that record straight and put that stat behind us
4761067 i was with my soccer circus in glasgow that day and we had a bit of a kids party
4761068 when i had last looked it was 0 0 at half time and when i saw the final result i thought newcastle must have had a player sent off early in the second half and not near the end
4761069 i had no absolutely no idea about what was going to happen in the next few days
4761070 its lovely to go back to your old club and get a result even if you enjoyed your time there every player likes that
4761071 to go there and get beaten is never pleasant but to go there and get beaten 6 0 will have hurt nicky butt and alan smith
4761072 but we can do something about it this time they will get another opportunity tomorrow
4761073 they can put that one behind them that one will be history and everyone will be talking about sundays result
4761074 football is a strange game alan smith will get his first goal for us soon and once that first one comes he will score two and hopefully three in a game
4761075 there will be a handful of teams unbeaten so far this season in the premier league on saturday night and we will be one of them

4761077 and there were no differences on those measures in the alcohol group compared to the no alcohol group
4761078 this suggests that the effect we observed wasnt due to a general change in mood
4761079 but some of our results suggest that theres more going on than we might have thought
4761080 the main question is whether these effects are specific to faces or whether we would rate anything as more attractive after a drink
4761081 to see if alcohol has a more general effect on perceiving beauty in the environment
4761082 its also surprising to see this effect is happening at lower doses than you might think
4761083 were trying to build up a more complete picture of what happens when people go out for a drink and were interested in certain behaviors that are more common after drinking such as unsafe sex or violence if this effect is happening at lower doses than expected it might be helpful for people who are predisposed to such behaviors to anticipate those situations and prevent them
4761084 but there are practical and ethical constraints around how much alcohol we can give people in the lab

4761093 we have never been so busy several hundred couples have registered to marry on aug 8
4761094 we want to show our support for the olympics a century old dream for china and take part in a major event
4761095 as early as spring 2007 some of our clients who plan to marry on aug 8 this year have already taken their wedding pictures
4761096 a century of the olympics a century long dream a century long prayer for happiness a century of perfect marriage
4761097 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4761098 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4761099 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4761100 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4761101 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4761102 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4761103 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4761104 your wise man dont know how feels to be thick as a brick
4761105 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4761106 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4761107 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again

4761111 this document is expected to be sent to leadership of coalition partners by sunday or monday and then it would be presented in the parliament
4761112 he had just signed the settlement plan consisting of the six earlier agreed upon principles
4761113 strong voluminous and powerful indictment of his systematic misrule and usurpation of parliaments powers
4761114 all scripture is breathed out by god and is profitable for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness that the man of god may be competent equipped for every good work
4761115 for the word of god is living and active sharper than a two edged sword piercing to the division of soul and of spirit of joints and of marrow and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart
4761116 the words of the lord are pure words like silver refined in a furnace on the ground purified seven times
4761117 and the word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory glory as of the only son from the father full of grace and truth
4761118 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4761119 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4761120 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4761121 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4761122 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4761123 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4761124 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4761125 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4761126 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4761127 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4761128 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4761129 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4761130 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4761131 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4761132 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4761133 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4761134 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4761135 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4761136 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4761137 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4761138 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4761139 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4761140 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4761141 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4761142 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4761143 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4761144 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4761145 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget

4761155 last week we shot in chinatown if you opened the door there were all these little girls out there screaming
4761156 they took a picture of me in a nurses outfit with him from the movie and a photographer made it look like it was real
4761157 we were supposed to be drunk and he was picking me up in this window it was actually kind of funny
4761158 a school is the hub of a community and a community is the hub of the world
4761159 how do i lead in such a way as to bring these about and how can i be certain they have transpired
4761160 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4761161 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4761162 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4761163 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4761164 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4761165 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4761166 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4761167 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4761168 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4761169 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4761170 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4761171 o mp se pautou em not cias veiculadas nos jornais

4761174 he is such a willing performer that you are tempted to listen to him at times he says he can play centre half or centre midfield or in goal this is the individual you are dealing with there is a great saying from the old days he can play anywhere rooney thinks he can
4761175 natuurlijk mag ik niet ontevreden zijn sterker nog dit was veruit het beste ooit dat ik op het water realiseerde
4761176 in de slotmeters wist ik niet dat ik zo dicht bij die top drie lag nu het is geen oneer om tegen zon drie krachtpatsers de duimen te moeten leggen in een eindsprint zelfs die lichte tegenwind hield me niet uit de top vier dit was een superrace de beste van mijn leven ik heb het nergens laten liggen de anderen waren gewoon iets beter
4761177 ik zal me daarover pas uitspreken als blijkt dat een goed project gespreid over vier jaar wordt uitgetekend dat moet dan ook met een degelijke begeleiding zijn want het contract van josy verdonckschoot loopt af na de spelen ik hoop wel dat mijn persoonlijke coach frans claes er verder wordt bij betrokken en dat iedereen die de roeisport kan helpen met het oog op londen 2012 dat ook zal doen we hebben met de nationale roeiploeg een erg leuk en succesvol seizoen achter de rug met onze vierde en achtste plaats bewezen we toch dat we alle optimale steun verdienen

4761184 surely now wiggins hoy romero and victoria pendleton are on the cusp of the transition from sportspeople we talk about three or four times a year to major public figures in the forefront of our thoughts
4761185 public safety in our city will be unaffected by the temporary mutual aid assignment in st paul
4761186 we would have the same number of officers we always have had conducting patrol duties on our streets
4761187 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4761188 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4761189 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4761190 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4761191 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4761192 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4761193 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4761194 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4761195 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4761196 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4761197 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4761198 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4761199 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4761200 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4761201 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4761202 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4761203 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4761204 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4761205 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4761206 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4761207 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4761208 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4761209 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally

4761213 debbie represents every mother that has helped her child to succeed whether in simply learning how to take those first steps or winning olympic gold we are thrilled to partner with her to celebrate and thank moms around the world
4761214 it is a wonderful honor to be named johnsons r baby mom of the olympic games
4761215 as i look back one of the hardest things i had to do with raising my son and both my two daughters was to trust they would be okay without me always by their side as they grew older like all mothers we just want our children to be happy safe and to excel in what they enjoy most and as a mom we do everything we can to make that possible

4761224 we dont need to get much better to achieve what we did last season but the challenge for us is to improve
4761225 you would think with young players like anderson cristiano ronaldo wayne rooney and nani we have the capacity to do that i am expecting a natural progression and there is no doubt in my mind this team will win championships long after i have left there is a good foundation here now

4761242 i know it sounds corny but we make it work by keeping things romantic and always maintaining the highest respect for one another the love we feel for one another is a given but i see other couples say things or act in a certain way that clearly communicates they have no respect for each other to me that is an unmistakable signal of a deep problem that will eventually kill whatever love exists i know i said it at your wedding but i absolutely believe you can have respect without love but you can never have a sustainable love without respect
4761243 year of 30 party for the girls that was about all of us
4761244 empleaban una gran violencia y despliegue de armas autom ticas
4761245 we were well in control and probably what we did with the ball at the start of that second half gave them a bit of a sniff
4761246 but i thought to cut that out and to get over the try line a couple more times was pretty impressive from us
4761247 we kept believing and it wasnt exactly pretty in the second half but we held them out which was good

4761280 j rgen klinsmann wie bewerten sie ihre premiere als trainer in der bundesliga
4761281 als trainer will man im ersten spiel nat rlich einen dreier einfahren das ist ganz klar wir waren auch auf einem guten weg haben den hsv durch den elfmeter zum 2 2 aber wieder zur ckgeholt wenn man alles addiert war es ein gerechtes ergebnis nach dieser zerfahrenen vorbereitung und mit den vielen verletzten muss man zufrieden sein auch wenn ich ein klein wenig entt uscht bin
4761282 sie haben in der coaching zone ber 90 minuten sehr viel engagement gezeigt haben ihr team immer wieder angefeuert ist der job als vereinstrainer stressiger als der des bundestrainers
4761283 es ist berhaupt nicht stressig sondern es macht irrsinnig spa wir trainer wollen es nicht anders wir wollen das adrenalin sp ren und am liebsten selbst mitspielen man ist auf strom
4761284 es hat zwei foulelfmeter gegeben wie bewerten sie die szenen
4761285 das muss man so nehmen wie es jetzt ist es ist vorgabe der liga an die schiedsrichter rigoroser zu werke zu gehen das hat thorsten kinh fer gemacht das ist vollkommen in ordnung
4761286 haben sie trotz des 2 2 fortschritte bei ihrer mannschaft gesehen
4761287 es gibt noch eine menge arbeit aber ich habe bei einzelnen spielern fortschritte gesehen die mannschaft sp rt langsam dass immer mehr frische und bewegung reinkommt wir kommen auch der feinabstimmung n her wir m ssen aber immer noch improvisieren wir brauchen noch einige zeit um den gew nschten spielfluss zu entwickeln und berall druck zu machen vor allem die nachz gler sind noch nicht auf dem leistungsstand um in der bundesliga 90 minuten zu gehen
4761288 ihre defensive hat erneut schw chen gezeigt wie beurteilen sie die leistung der abwehr
4761289 dass wir noch nicht eingespielt sind ist ganz normal es findet noch ein herantasten statt wir arbeiten an den taktischen elementen
4761290 want to be right amp claim everyone else is wrong
4761291 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4761292 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4761293 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4761294 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4761295 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4761296 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4761297 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4761298 the output is a very clear understanding of what the system should look like the project has developed an entire system concept and a related reference design for a future air interface this can be used as input for the standardisation process that is now starting
4761299 no one had anything to lose and therefore we could start a joint development of a new system where everyone could bring in their ideas
4761300 we started more or less from zero so everyone could gain something
4761301 our industry partners went to the lte standardisation and many organisations have taken winner results because we already achieved some consensus there these kinds of projects are supporting consensus building
4761302 basically youll get in a wireless system a similar experience as in your office or your home
4761303 in europe this may not happen before 2015 though in some countries it could be earlier
4761304 it really depends on conditions in different countries and also on market needs of course
4761305 asia is still growing fast but in ten years they will also have a saturated market the need then will be to improve the capabilities of systems from an industry perspective we have to offer innovative solutions in order to stay competitive in the global market
4761306 i think we have to work hard of course but there is a good chance because we have the people the know how and the means for this kind of co operation
4761307 what industry has to do is invest in research and development in order to stay inventive
4761308 technology is always moving its always improving we can decide either to be in the group which is improving and innovating or we are not in that group i think its better to be in the group thats improving
4761309 we worked on head mounted displays improved tiled displays rendering and streaming software colour calibration techniques collaboration and networking and novel interaction systems
4761310 better yet the handheld model can also block out daylight so you dont get the usual problem of sunlight washing out the image it is a breakthrough and the daylight blocking hmd will feature this month at siggraph 2008 in los angeles
4761311 it takes a lot of processing power to render a virtual image onto a real landscape mobile device cpus cannot really cope we developed a video streaming protocol that allows a desktop to perform the rendering but then streams a compressed signal across wireless networks
4761312 we are already in discussion with some companies about commercial opportunities for the rendering platform
4761313 in contrast to marker based tracking where we track labels with patterns on it in marker less tracking we detect feature points in real scenes and compare current images from a camera to calibrated reference images of the same scene to calculate the current position of a user
4761314 you get big calibration problems with projectors on multi tiled displays because projectors vary or projector bulbs deteriorate at different rates it affects image quality but our calibration tool ensures faithful colour across the multiple screens
4761315 the mix of applications meant we had to develop low cost but high performance systems the tests were successful and the system performed well
4761316 it is unlikely that the platform will be commercialised as one product but most of the components will have direct commercial potential and many of them are a real advance on what is currently available

4761396 all three cities already had special projects underway aimed at e enabling certain parts of the city and were working closely with local universities to achieve this aim
4761397 but we decided to join forces along with a number of private companies to develop a set of tools aimed specifically at facilitating citizen communication
4761398 these are citizen based tools designed by citizens and for citizens but that can also be accessed by city authorities in order to improve their services
4761399 one of the concerns for administrations is that they do not want to dismantle their existing communications infrastructure our platform can be simply wrapped around the existing structure to provide an extra service layer this limits the costs involved in implementing it
4761400 relay stations are much smaller than base stations and are much easier to deploy they can be fixed onto lamp posts for example
4761401 they also should only cost around one fifth of the price as the intelligence is in the base station and unlike base stations they do not require a directed backhaul connection to the internet

4761429 therefore as representatives of civil society we condemn the behaviour of these two leaders and take it upon ourselves to expose them and their unacceptable behaviour before the eyes of the world

4761479 last week was disappointing but last sunday we watched the tape together and we analysed it we realised the positives from it as well and the boys saw that
4761480 we created chances and we just simply need to put them away if we had put them away in the first half i think we would have won the game
4761481 it should be a cracking game as falkirk will pass the ball as they always like to do
4761482 we are still peeved we didnt get the goal against rangers last week
4761483 the gaffer has got his beliefs and his philosophy on how he wants to play football

4761507 el pp ha ofrecido su colaboraci n al gobierno pero es muy dif cil colaborar con quien no quiere hacerlo lo que s creo que tiene sentido es que acepte la petici n de colaboraci n que le ha hecho la oposici n manifest

4761531 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
4761532 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

4761548 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in costs we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it

4761576 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4761577 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4761578 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4761579 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4761611 an issue widely discussed in the aids 2008 conference is the fact that several countries deny the entry stay or residence of hiv positive people because of their hiv status according to the publication entry denied published by unaids in partnership with other organisations and distributed at the conference at least 67 countries are on the list of those that deny the entry to people living with hiv aids

4761614 many aids experts and rights activists find the new legislation to be a cause for celebration previously travel restrictions could cause more trouble than they prevented causing people with hiv to lie about their condition it was discriminatory and would also lead to many of the infected to lie
4761615 it is now up to the secretary of health to change regulations to reflect the new legislation hiv must be taken off of the list of diseases that mean inadmissibility to the united states but congresswoman barbara lee is confident that this will happen soon

4761787 i dont know how shell manage it will definitely make the show more interesting after all jade goody is an anglicised version of rakhi sawant a loudmouth crass yet honest
4761788 lets just hope shes changed her mind about indians by now
4761789 this is certainly the best moment of my life as we have got a gold medal for the country who was starving for a gold medal for more than hundred years i am proud of it as it shows that yes we can also win gold medals in the olympics

4761797 there are a number of local chinese managers of multinationals or private sector companies who have gone to work in the state sector
4761798 everywhere we went it seemed as if air china had been there the day before
4761799 you are starting to see the development of a really interesting dynamic in the state sector
4761800 it is not the case that soes are going to dominate the entire economy but i am very optimistic about some of them
4761801 to develop a car company in china you need to be able to play both sides running the business with private sector type discipline but also getting close to local governments for the land and bank contacts that this brings
4761802 it is the state and not households that became wealthier during the blossoming of the soes
4761803 households actually enjoyed only a small portion of the expanding wealth cake
4761804 chinese oil companies and a lot of other oil companies in sudan have made the money it is not the people or the country that have made money
4761805 it is not the government deciding to go to sudan it is the oil company they have gradually developed their business and asked the government for support
4761806 the companys domination of the sudanese oil industry arguably has done more damage to chinas reputation abroad than the activities of any other chinese soe
4761807 the case demonstrates how the overseas activities of a chinese soe can simultaneously harm one chinese foreign policy objective to be and be perceived as a responsible rising power and help another to enhance energy security
4761808 in the future this issue will become more and more serious

4761825 we pushed linfield all the way to the last game last season this season the goal is to improve and hopefully we can improve and get as close if not closer this time
4761826 i have talked to the players and told them that i want an improvment what way we improve i will have to wait and see because we havent played a competitive game as yet
4761827 no matter what happens i think every club wants to progress season after season and that is our goal
4761828 i want to do better than last year and the players want that too
4761829 i think this is a massive season for the league as a whole
4761830 a lot of people are excited about the new format and what we all hope will be an improvement in the standard
4761831 i am expecting a very tough and competitive league with a lot ot teams having added to their squad to strengthen them over the summer with the new league in mind
4761832 i look at crusaders glenavon and coleraine as teams who will be strong and challenging
4761833 i think every game will be competitive and right from the start of the season you have points to play for rather than leading in with the cis cup so we all have to be on the front foot from the very beginning
4761834 we are all football people and we want to play football we had done all our work in training on thursday night to get ready for saturday expecting a game and then we ended up without one
4761835 we had nothing to do with that the dispute was between the referees and the football authourities and i didnt want to comment on that
4761836 it has been sorted out i am glad it has been sorted out and we are all back in action now
4761837 we have had problems with training this week the weather meant that where we usually train was unusable on tuesday night and on thursday night we trained at the oval
4761838 our pitch is in great condition and the players cant wait to get on it and play again

4761852 the inhabitant of london could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various products of the whole earth he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world
4761853 regarded this state of affairs as normal certain and permanent except in the direction of further improvement the projects and politics of militarism and imperialism of racial and cultural rivalries of monopolies restrictions and exclusion appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice
4761854 im mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore this didnt have to happen
4761855 its really a fight for the soul of the profession
4761856 the vast majority of military psychologists know the ethics code and know exactly what they can and cannot do
4761857 this is a fight about individual psychologists behavior and we should keep it there
4761858 a principled stance against our nations policy of using psychologists to oversee abusive and coercive interrogations
4761859 it is consistent with the a p a ethics code for psychologists to serve in consultative roles to interrogation and information gathering processes for national security related purposes
4761860 health professionals bound by strong ethical imperatives to do no harm may become calibrators of harm
4761861 concentrates on isolating the detainee and fostering dependence of the detainee on his interrogator
4761862 theres no doubt that the psychologists presence can be abused
4761863 but if theres no presence at all then theres no accountability and you walk away feeling noble and righteous but you havent done a damned thing
4761864 if you take the position that interrogation cannot be done ethically then the discussion stops there
4761865 but if the answer is yes then you dont shut down the whole operation because certain individuals behaved unethically
4761866 the idea that a psychologist or psychiatrist is going to systematically unlock any prisoners resistance and provide some unique strategy is completely false its a fantasy

4761873 when the crystal palace pool closed at 45 minutes notice it left the people there in a dire situation
4761874 they contacted me to see what was available and now they come to use our equipment about three times a week
4761875 i think its a really good thing to see a facility like ours being utilised to its full potential and especially in training olympic hopefuls it also creates a lot of interest among the public because whenever they come to the pool there is almost always diving training going on
4761876 the closure of crystal palace has devastated our programme and weve lost a lot of members as a result
4761877 we spent two and a half years visiting 200 schools in the london area and testing 50 000 pupils to see if they had what it takes we whittled that down to 20 and they are all absolutely amazing as good as what they have in china
4761878 were still looking good for the 2012 olympics and thats partly because of tunbridge wells if the pool didnt exist then the whole programme would have folded and the chinese coaches would have gone home because the pools in london arent good enough and there is nowhere else nearby
4761879 then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done and there were noises and thunderings and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such a mighty and great earthquake as had not occurred since men were on the earth
4761880 now the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon was remembered before god to give her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath
4761881 awake awake stand up o jerusalem you who have drunk at the hand of the lord the cup of his fury
4761882 then every island fled away and the mountains were not found

4761884 the usa is engaged in an anti missile defence for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 per cent

4761889 i saw the finish on the big screen after the race and then i saw it slowed down frame by frame at the massage area
4761890 i was looking at the computer and its almost too close to see one one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport its pretty cool
4761891 it would be good for the sport if he lost
4761892 im sure people will be bringing this up for years saying that you know you won that race
4761893 is michael phelps the gold medal winner i think if we had to do this again id win

4761895 both of us have metallic goggles so i couldnt see his eyes and he couldnt see mine

4761897 if i would have glided i would have ended up being way too long i ended up making the right decision trying to just take sort of a short fast stroke to try to get my hand on the wall first it turned out to be in my favor
4761898 it seems like every day im in sort of a dream world
4761899 sometimes you sort of have to pinch yourself to see if its really real im just happy im in the real world

4761927 i was surprised when we missed the kick by about a length as his trainer wanted him ridden close to the lead
4761928 the epsom is still in our minds but every race he wins makes it harder as far as the handicaps are concerned
4761929 it was a big step up for him today when a horse wins the doncaster as a three year old with a light weight there is always a worry as to whether they come back or not
4761930 it wont be easy placing him now but its great to have this win today and know where we are with him
4761931 he lacks a bit of match practice and the jockey lacks a bit of match practice but its great to be back on him
4761932 he was very relaxed and was going to win by four lengths but he looked around a bit when he got to the front
4761933 the horse has grown taller and his stride has lengthened since i rode him last and he does have the makings of a weight for age horse

4762244 you should have heard the way hes been talking about you over those weeks and over summer
4762245 describe a recent development in the industry what implications might this development have for our firm or the division to which you have applied
4762246 if you change your mind about your firm or insurance if you no longer wish to go to your firm and or insurance but you met the offer or theyre accepting you with lower grades then youll have to phone the universities concerned and beg them to release you theyll probably want reasons and they might not do it straight away it could take up to 2 weeks for it to be processed which is a long time in clearing so do this asap so you dont miss out on the best places
4762247 clearing officially is open until september 20th however most people wont take that long it depends how quickly you can make your mind up where you want to go if youre absolutely certain which uni and course is right for you you can get it done in a few days but if you cant decide you may want to take a bit longer many people wish to visit several universities and they may have special open days set up to help with your choice of course if you entered clearing by getting released from your firm or insurance choice then you might not actually be eligible for a few weeks in this case clearing will take longer for you
4762248 clearing passport is a special form that ucas will send to you as soon as youre eligible for clearing youll need to keep it safe as you can only have one when youve decided which university you want to go to youll give them your clearing passport to secure your place you must give the clearing passport to the university themselves do not send it to ucas you can only give it to one university so be sure that you want to go there the best way to send your clearing passport to the uni is to take it there yourself you can have a look around whilst youre there which will help you decide if you want to go there if you hand in your clearing passport to a uni you can be 99 certain that theyll accept you they wouldnt take your clearing passport off you otherwise as you can only give it to one university so then you can go home happy and can wait for your confirmation letter from ucas in the post if you really cant visit or if you receive your clearing passport from ucas after you have visited the uni then youll need to post it i would recommend using recorded delivery at least so that you know it gets there do i have to wait until i receive my clearing passport to apply no as soon as you know youre in clearing you can start phoning unis if you had to be released by either your firm or insurance you will need to wait for confirmation that this has been done which may take a few weeks otherwise you can start straight away your ucas track page should show that youre in clearing universities may ask for details that you dont have such as your clearing number but explain that you havent received your clearing passport yet and it will be fine update them as soon as you have got it
4762249 thank you for your enquiry regarding the above course of study i am pleased to advise you that we are able to offer you a unconditional place on the above course subject to you completing and returning to us your clearing passport

4762318 the government of saudi arabia may have told the state department it would thoroughly revise its textbooks in order to diffuse criticism two years ago but its two years later and now is the time for reckoning the state department must now demonstrate it was not an unwitting accomplice to a public relations ploy they must intensely scrutinize these textbooks and work with them to remove it or impose sanctions

4762390 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4762391 it is unlikely that ossetians and abkhazians will be able to live with georgians in one state
4762392 the russian attack on georgia had profound implications and will have profound implications for russias relations with its neighbors and with the world

4762397 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
4762398 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4762399 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4762400 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4762401 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4762402 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
4762403 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
4762404 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
4762405 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
4762406 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
4762407 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4762408 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
4762409 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
4762410 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
4762411 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
4762412 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4762413 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4762414 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4762415 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
4762416 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
4762417 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
4762418 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy

4762426 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
4762427 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
4762428 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4762429 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4762430 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
4762431 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
4762432 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent

4762435 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
4762436 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
4762437 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
4762438 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
4762439 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
4762440 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot

4762446 under house arrest for the inappropriate actions of a few
4762447 i cant believe theyd be that stupid to try and dust off a statute its sort of like trying to prosecute people for adultery or something
4762448 its been fully litigated and they cant do it thats all there is
4762449 we must do this because we cannot and will not tolerate innocent people especially children to be victims
4762450 this is not something we take likely but given the incident of this weekend we need to take firm action and this is the kind of action thats required in order to ensure the safety of our residents
4762451 but this is aimed at helping young people in our city this is not an attempt to be punitive
4762452 we have intelligence reports confirming iranian sponsored groups are planning to return back to iraq and are targeting specific coalition forces isf iraqi security forces and iraqi citizens

4762457 regrettably there is considerable evidence that elements of the bush administration were complicit in the 9 11 attack and may even have helped stage it let us now examine some of what i regard as the most compelling evidence however the following discussion makes no claim to be comprehensive
4762458 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
4762459 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties

4762461 an mx registered truck probably wont be automatically excluded from getting grant funding
4762462 however it will need to meet all the standard criteria be assured that no truck will be funded under either ports funds unless it can be shown to meet all program requirements as a legitimate frequent tripper and contributor to the ports air quality programs
4762463 it appears that certain mexican trucking companies could meet the requirements of this program
4762464 subsidized lease or grant using a combination of port and proposition 1b funds
4762465 if not for the perverted economic model that has developed in the ports there would be no need to subsidize port replacement trucks in the first place
4762466 the city pulled its voting machines from here because the building gets too hot yet now theyll put people in there who use those machines to vote
4762467 there are no toilets there theres no water no fire suppression the city should be ashamed it needs to stop criminalizing protests
4762468 we asked them if a detention center existed they told us it will be business as usual dont worry about it
4762469 apparently the training received by the undercover officers in charge of crowd control didnt sink in theyre the guys who arrested john heaney and broke his two front teeth smashing his head into the asphalt
4762470 were asking that those officers be off duty during the convention
4762471 we have limited pitch authority at flight levels were descending to see if we can regain pitch authority
4762472 at this time we would like to declare this an emergency and also have cfr fire and rescue equipment standing by in st louis

4762478 after all the effort that we put in to get somebody a fair trial and then to say no matter what we did it didnt matter i dont see that as a positive step
4762479 i think it was generally our opinion that hamdan made some bad mistakes in his life that led him down a path that turned out to be a bad one once he was in it i dont see that it was that easy to get out
4762480 the fact that he apologized that didnt sound like al qaida to me
4762481 if the first guy is getting a 30 year sentence what do you do for a real hard core criminal
4762482 two militants attempted to flee and were pursued by coalition military working dogs
4762483 both militants received dog bite injuries one of which required treatment on scene by coalition medical personnel

4762487 it is very unfortunate and i am sorry that it happened and my heartfelt condolences go out to mr muttons family
4762488 standard operating procedure required a response to this case within 20 minutes
4762489 this did not occur as it took paramedics two hours and five minutes to respond
4762490 while some crews were waiting to admit patients at cbh there were other resources available that should have been redirected
4762491 mr muttons case was urgent enough to require the attendance of one of those crews
4762492 we are human we do 60 000 cases a year and now what we have to do as these cases come up is and we dont always get it as right as we want is not to have a witch hunt
4762493 did not dream the doctors could not find me a bed
4762494 we would never consider living here permanently as we have such good health care in ballarat and melbourne
4762495 however once admitted to the emergency department some patients may experience a delay in being transferred to a ward due to a shortage of beds in the main hospital at the time they are admitted
4762496 the bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals and 362 admonishments to heterosexuals that doesnt mean that god doesnt love heterosexuals its just that they need more supervision
4762497 beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them for then you will have no reward from your father who is in heaven
4762498 for the court to take such extraordinary action on its own indicates the importance the judges place on the case and means that maher may finally see justice in this country
4762499 spray and pray charge everybody lets go speed speed speed
4762500 superficial personality conflict general hartmann came in kicked over some furniture wasnt so gentle as some subordinates wish
4762501 to allow or direct a prosecutor to come into the courtroom and offer evidence they felt was torture it puts a prosecutor in an ethical bind

4762505 making sure jerome corsi doesnt get away with his lies unchallenged
4762506 gave the impression we were telling associates how to vote they were wrong and acting without approval
4762507 we believe that if the fec looks into this they will find what weve known all along that we did nothing wrong
4762508 i do not have any trust in this legal farce

4762516 we are confident that jackson browne will prevail in this lawsuit not only have senator mccain and his agents plainly infringed mr brownes copyright in running on empty but the federal courts have long held that the unauthorized use of a famous singers voice in a commercial constitutes a false endorsement and a violation of the singers right of publicity
4762517 in light of jackson brownes lifelong commitment to democratic ideals and political candidates the misappropriation of jackson brownes endorsement is entirely reprehensible and i have no doubt that a jury will agree
4762518 several of us talked to him when he would come to the match but it was only about the shoot i never heard him discuss politics i never heard him discuss any derogatory statements about anyone anywhere any time
4762519 he was one of those people that would blend into the background if you were asked to describe him afterwards he be very hard to pull out of your memory banks
4762520 he looked at me like he couldnt believe i was talking to him
4762521 no meaningful difference between a broken pool cue and a firearm
4762522 one scumbag down i m sure more of the same will follow in the coming months good riddance to all of these hacks that have run this nation into the gutter i d buy that guy a 6 pack if the pigs hadnt killed him

4762530 while we argue about all the things that dont matter republicans and democrats walk hand in hand down the aisle with our future
4762531 gun manufacturers build guns for only one reason and that to kill other human beings
4762532 why does it always have to be politics religion or race
4762533 well i dont know a lot about john mccains family history i do know however that as recently as last week i think it was the senator made a comment in south dakota regarding his wife entering some buffalo chips contest which is this topless deal and if she were to enter she would probably win it and my personal opinion and based on my understanding of the christian faith thats not not n o t not the type of expression that a presidential candidate or anyone for that matter who is a follower of the christian faith ought to make
4762534 i dont know if that is a perfect case in point but it surely does help to juxtapose the dna of senator obama if you would versus the dna of senator mccain
4762535 and as recently as yesterday i think it is our pastor from saddleback rick warren indicated that he would not feel comfortable voting for an adulterer and i dont know exactly to whom he was referring but i think the data speaks for itself and again at the end of the day and i really appreciate you raising this because at the end of the day again i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency character and competency so whatever questions that should be asked that would give the voting public an indication as to who they are and what theyve done should be fair game
4762536 absolutely i would absolutely i would because if you cant keep your faith to your most sacred vow til death do us part how in the world can i trust you to lead my family my government my nation absolutely i would i think people first need to ask forgiveness and then earn trust back over time can trust be re earned absolutely but it takes time
4762537 my advice to the obama people proceed with extreme caution they dont want to get into a discussion of character and background they are opening a door that they will not be able to close they are putting on the table issues and personalities that they do not want to discuss
4762538 sen mccain has a great sense of humor like mine but sometimes it does not go over as well as we hope i know a little bit about that
4762539 that sen mccain has been very honest about his life and about not only who he was but i think very refreshingly who he is and the one thing i find about sen mccain is that he is a man of honor i said that on the debate stage even when i was his political opponent i still say that today
4762540 this is the kind of conversation that makes up a political campaign people digging as deep as they can to find some little nugget to elevate and to amplify and that is what that is about but i dont think anyone who has ever been around john mccain would accuse him of being a person who did not have respect for his wife
4762541 i could no more disown reverend wright than i could disown my grandmother
4762542 id rather have an adulterer and wife abuser than obama in the white house
4762543 mccain is the classic opportunist always reaching for attention and glory after he came home carol walked with a limp so he threw her over for a poster girl with big money and the rest if history
4762544 america is the greatest country in the history of the world
4762545 1986 race for us senate as quoted in the tucson citizen
4762546 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die when she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask where is that marvelous ape
4762547 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die when she finally regains consciousness and tries to speak her doctor leans over to hear her sigh contently and to feebly ask where is that marvelous ape
4762548 it is quite obvious that mccain has little respect for his wife if he would make comments like he did in sd
4762549 did you hear the one about the woman who is attacked on the street by a gorilla beaten senseless raped repeatedly and left to die
4762550 at least i dont plaster on the makeup like a trollop you c nt
4762551 why is chelsea clinton so ugly because janet reno is her father
4762552 pot had helped and booze maybe a little blow when you could afford it not smack though
4762553 i think the american public deserves full revelation of the candidates character and competency
4762554 i cannot see a more counterproductive candidate for women i cannot vote for mccain
4762555 people would be calling in to state committee headquarters every week absolutely enraged threatening to leave the party because of some comments mccain made the guy has no core his only principle is winning the presidency he likes to call his campaign the straight talk express well down here we call it the forked tongue express mccain is mentally unstable and out of control and vindictive what does that say about his ability to handle real political problems
4762556 everybody has a mccain story if you work in the senate for a while you have a mccain story he hasnt built up a lot of goodwill
4762557 ive witnessed a lot of his temper and outbursts for me some of this stuff is relevant it raises questions about stability its more than just temper its this need of his to show you that hes above you a sneering condescending attitude its hurt his relationships in congress ive seen it up close
4762558 i think what you got out of the article when you read it is questionable
4762559 i do not see where the pilots piece point to the drug laws as being the problem
4762560 current policies arent working theyre hypocritical expensive and clog our court system though it might be political suicide lawmakers should consider legalizing marijuana for personal use
4762561 the debate should continue on the local and national level its tragic that it took the deaths of two officers to reignite the discussion
4762562 as the general election approaches the demand for on time travel payment is as important as ever
4762563 we believe a fifty thousand dollar monthly credit line per person is a safe estimate of what to expect in the coming months this estimate includes air and ground travel plus any miscellaneous costs that may arise throughout the week food power internet etc
4762564 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself

4762566 due to circumstances beyond our control no were not breaking up so dont believe anything that might start floating around on the internet we will not be taking part in that tour we wish every other band on the tour well and hope that it is a great success for them and for the people behind the scenes working hard to make it a great tour
4762567 we have a good amount of ideas in the initial testing stages and were about to really dive in

4762581 this summit affords us the possibility to assist the zimbabwean parties to finalise their negotiations so that together they can engage the work to achieve national healing and reconciliation
4762582 attend to the matter of reconstruction and development of zimbabwe and in this way extricate the masses of the people from the dire straits in which they find themselves
4762583 zimbabwe has no doubt left a serious blot on the culture of democracy in the region
4762584 i express my gratitude to president thabo mbeki for the tireless efforts that he has shown in helping our zimbabwean brothers overcome their differences and to take on in the interest of zimbabweans the new challenges that confront their country
4762585 in recent times however we have had too numerous challenges that have tested the very cohesion that acted as a potent weapon against those forces that have an interest in our perpetual weaknesses and marginalisation
4762586 because in reality our actions still define us as the front line states
4762587 the masses of our people demand of us to do everything in our power to help pull the poor from the morass of wretchedness
4762588 we need extraordinary efforts to face the numerous challenges facing us even though the overall economy of our region has continued to grow at a steady pace we are still far from achieving a better life for all
4762589 not only were these events alien to our region but they also brought into question in some quarters the integrity of sadc as an institution capable of promoting the rule of law and democratic governance

4762601 one day my father called me and told me to accept marriage to a man he knew he threatened me not to think of refusing then he took me and an old man accompanied by a 13 year old girl from al sulaimaniah village to al eiss village
4762602 at the office of the marriage official mazoun they asked for the results of pre marriage tests which they said could be ready within a week if we start the procedures she said the tests were completed later that afternoon and she was afraid of her father after he had threatened her
4762603 i kept crying but they didnt give any attention to my tears despite the desperate attempts by the woman who hosted us in her house to officiate the marriage she telephoned my mother and appealed to her to rescue me and stop this marriage
4762604 its not going to help him in any way to harm that woman

4762607 we dont care as long as the emotions are there and the story is structured right we always just want to have it seem as natural as possible and we dont pretend that we can write exactly how people speak to one another at all times we just love to have people kind of do what they want
4762608 daves direction is a lot more attitude based and he doesnt worry about changing the lines that much but hell give you a direction say it like a robot say it like a drunk robot now say it like youve got ear wax in your mouth hes much more a performance based director
4762609 we knew that there was a really bad version of the film when i first heard the idea for it i thought this isnt going to be good
4762610 judd had a kind of loose idea for a weed action movie we thought thats a strange notion then we kind of realized there hadnt really been a weed movie that was that good and actually functioned as a real movie so we thought wouldnt it be nice if there was a really good weed movie better yet an action packed weed movie and we kind of just went from there
4762611 they really didnt want to write a sequel and so the compromise is to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow getting these characters together which doesnt make sense at all but could work im guessing that saul could sell the superbad characters something and the kids could get into some trouble and wed help them out of it seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off
4762612 its so nice when you work so hard and it comes off as soon as i was on my own i thought right im going to go for this time
4762613 i was promised some jimmy choo shoes if i won so thats one pair and my mums promised to get me another pair of christian louboutin shoes

4762668 how did you find your way to the pool theres no way you could have gotten here the lights were off
4762669 heh heh heh heh fire heh heh with one flash and two gels he has taken a long dark hallway and connoted fire why two ctos because one would not be enough for the look he wanted which was vibrant off the scale warm you can stack them you know the light is flaring back into the camera but thats okay because mr firefighter trainee is going to block it in a moment keith already has a working aperture whatever it happens to be is pretty arbtrary pulled from the no flash available light exposure needed to make the continuous lit floor section correctly exposed lets stop here for a moment and see how he could control his flash without leaving the camera a thinking photographers remote control say the flash is a stop too hot and keith needed to dial it back down one stop for the effect that he wants lets also say for the sake of discussion that his chosen ambient exposure is 1 15th at f 4 what could he do to only adjust the exposure of the background flash without leaving the camera well the flash cares about the aperture and it is one stop too hot in our little hypothetical scenario at f 4 so to knock it down a stop all you have to do is to expose the scene at f 5 6 right but moving to 1 15th at f 5 6 is gonna drop your ambient floor tones down a stop too so to compensate for the fact that we have bumped the aperture from f 4 to f 5 6 to knock the flash down we also change the shutter from 1 15th to 1 8th of a sec now with a quick settings change the floor is getting exactly the same exposure 1 15th f 4 1 8th f 5 6 but the flashs exposure has been lessened by one stop neat huh im telling you you do not get a physique like mine by unnecessarily walking all the way down that hall to adjust a flash ill dial the front flash up or down as my final exposure tweak its only a few steps away now where are those donuts we got to fuel the days shoots remember to check your background flash light level to see if it even needs adjusting you would simply turn your hand into a stand in for the firefighter and hold it between you and the background flash i use the hand model thing a lot this way you see how the light will look wrapping around a gobo subject as it will be in the final image you know you did it keith wheres that photo now light the front next you add your firefighter and adjust the power output and or distance of the foreground flash until he he is correctly exposed at your chosen shutter aperture combo but all that really matters for this part is the aperture the foreground flash btw is another vivitar 283 shot into a 60

4762693 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling
4762694 with this growing level of scientific uncertainty it makes no sense to enact a new set of economically damaging regulations prompted by the global warming hysteria of recent years

4762696 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs

4762699 la carne no se ha notado al alza de manera exclusiva han sido todos los alimentos los productores dicen que subir un 50 pero yo creo que la carne ya subi lo suficiente
4762700 ya se han generado alzas del 15 as que estimamos que puede haber un incremento de m ximo un 20 pero no m s
4762701 el alza es un fen meno que ha venido aumentando durante el a o
4762702 los precios de importaci n de la carne subieron ya en un 90 respecto al a o pasado el precio de la tonelada de carne casi se ha duplicado entonces es dif cil que suba explosivamente

4762709 el tema de las aerol neas es sensible tanto las privadas como las estatales han estado fallando en am rica latina
4762710 puede ser una muy idea una gran aerol nea de am rica del sur para competir en los mercados mundiales pero es complejo unir estas tres l neas que no son exitosas que tienen problemas estructurales principalmente de costos y equipamiento
4762711 chile no va a integrarse a este proyecto porque dado su aislamiento ha tenido que generar sus propios recursos y se ve fortalecido frente a este tipo de acuerdos
4762712 lo que le est diciendo argentina brasil y venezuela a nuestro pa s es que est n actuando como una triada donde no nos tienen en consideraci n
4762713 el posible proyecto de la aerol nea afecta de manera considerable las relaciones del mercosur pues brasil est desacoplado

4762754 last week was disappointing but last sunday we watched the tape together and we analysed it we realised the positives from it as well and the boys saw that
4762755 we created chances and we just simply need to put them away if we had put them away in the first half i think we would have won the game
4762756 it should be a cracking game as falkirk will pass the ball as they always like to do
4762757 we are still peeved we didnt get the goal against rangers last week

4762775 pike and grutza are competing in a very hotly contested quarterback situation
4762776 it showed me that this is the time ive got to do it now nor never
4762777 hes making the throws that we expect our quarterback to make
4762778 in a spread offense he can make all the throws right now its just a matter of his footwork and some technique things that allow him to compete for the starting job
4762779 i told both collaros and anderson that they have made great progress demetrius has got to be more consistent but hes progressed to the point where we can see down the road that hes going to be a very good quarterback
4762780 but right now my attention is on the pike grutza battle and thats going to be a fun one
4762781 grutza is the no 1 right now but hes got to get healthy hes got to get back out there and make plays because tony pikes making them
4762782 pike and grutza are competing in a very hotly contested quarterback situation
4762783 it showed me that this is the time ive got to do it now nor never
4762784 hes making the throws that we expect our quarterback to make
4762785 in a spread offense he can make all the throws right now its just a matter of his footwork and some technique things that allow him to compete for the starting job
4762786 i told both collaros and anderson that they have made great progress demetrius has got to be more consistent but hes progressed to the point where we can see down the road that hes going to be a very good quarterback
4762787 we have a pretty crucial day and a half here
4762788 were trying to get a sense and feel for some of the position changes weve made in the past few days obviously deangelo smith is playing a lot of safety we want to find out who that other guy next to him is going to be were still very fluid defensively if we lined up tomorrow
4762789 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4762790 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4762791 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4762792 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4762793 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4762794 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4762795 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4762796 we here at kaiser pickles are proud to support the university of cincinnati bearcats by wearing red amp black on fridays we are hoping that this will show our support of the university that is a less than a mile and a half from us
4762797 a 12h20 les forces russes ont fait sauter un grand pont ferroviaire pr s de gori a la suite de cette destruction il ny a plus de communications ferroviaires entre lest et louest du pays pour combien de temps je ne sais
4762798 nous sommes maintenant en temps de paix pourquoi irions nous faire sauter des ponts
4762799 cest encore une de ces affirmations qui ne sont jamais v rifi es
4762800 un mont n de personas tiene ideas sobre c mo monetizar esto y nosotros tambi n
4762801 je me sens vraiment bien cela sest pass de mani re assez d tendue je voulais juste me qualifier
4762802 ne vous inqui tez pas pour moi je vais bien je serai pr t pour la comp tition d s la premi re course
4762803 if i am in a race then i want to win it it is never great fun to be fifth or sixth even third place doesnt feel so great to me anymore i only want to win
4762804 whoever thinks i am content or tired is completely wrong if we do not get both championship titles at the end of the season then we will be disappointed
4762805 the fact that 10 member unions have signalled their intention to tender for the 2015 and 2019 tournaments reflects the growing global prestige of the rugby world cup
4762806 the irb council will announce the rwc 2015 and 2019 host unions in july 2009 six years prior to the first tournament and 10 years prior to the 2019 event
4762807 you can make these up to one week in advance
4762808 thats the main inhibiting factor right now the interaction with land
4762809 i fell off four steps and hit the pavement i just forgot to hold onto the railing and fell right on my forehead i hit hard
4762810 it hit me so hard that i had to leave my home i wanted to be there the rest of my days but it didnt work out that way
4762811 im feeling much better now i heal up so wonderfully im back to normal again
4762812 she could probably drive and live alone again but we just want her to be careful
4762813 shes like a mother to me and i love her dearly
4762814 we had to spoon feed her to bring her back to life because she just stopped eating but shes doing great now
4762815 i dont know why i guess the lord doesnt want me yet i thank the lord for my blessings hes answered my prayers
4762816 the best part of the whole deal is that shes really healthy now
4762817 we started having big birthday parties for her when she turned 90 who would have thought that 17 years later wed still be having them
4762818 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4762819 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
4762820 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
4762821 its not how young you are its how old you arent
4762822 they recognize that florida is in play and what they say about the space program is going to matter to floridians
4762823 florida has become pivotal not only as an election state but pivotal to the space program
4762824 this is such an unbelievable tragedy that took place it took away one of our own
4762825 but im so thankful to the city of new york and to the citizens who came to her aid like real heroes out of a comic book
4762826 he said oh my lord i dont have no brakes it happened so quick i just closed my eyes
4762827 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4762828 i had grease on my hands but i did this from my heart
4762829 im just stoked to be here at the olympics i thought id be watching them at home on tv
4762830 this year has been such a total blur lets try this lets try that i just now feel like im starting to get the hang of it by the time 2012 rolls around im going to have everything dialed
4762831 world record holder chris boardman says if you get halfway through a pursuit and you feel like you can go faster youve started out too slow
4762832 if you feel like youre going to die youve started too fast if you feel like you can maybe hold on its perfect
4762833 at the halfway point i was wishing i only had 1000 meters to go
4762834 it hurt ive been training for 3km pursuits a lot this year and just four extra laps makes such a difference even yesterday i blew up in the last 1k and it cost me time
4762835 his goal was to make the second round and he did
4762836 its a great cinderella story but the reality is that there were a bunch of pros lined up who werent interested in making that story happen but with taylor we have time
4762837 the bouncing is what happens when your body just starts dying she wasnt wanting to ride like that trust me
4762838 as soon as she got out of the start her body was dumping lactic acid if the body isnt there not much you can do
4762839 ill probably shed a couple of tears tonight but i need to let it go and move forward
4762840 it wasnt for a lack of trying i can guarantee that it just wasnt my day
4762841 im going to take some time for enjoyment thats been lacking
4762842 i havent really been having fun so far every time ive done well ive taken time to enjoy the moment
4762843 japan is the first developed country to face this kind of population crisis
4762844 i dont think there is any way forward but to accept immigrants
4762845 i think this is very good timing to start thinking about this
4762846 they were just brought in and nothing was done to help them in terms of welfare
4762847 then people blame the foreigners for the problems even though its japan that invited them here and didnt do anything for them
4762848 i think the system will turn out to be an embarrassment
4762849 almost nobody will pass and they will be told to go home
4762850 no cuentan con la estima y consideraci n que se merecen por parte de la administraci n educativa
4762851 a o tras a o se mantiene una discriminaci n laboral inaceptable con respecto a sus hom logos de la ense anza p blica
4762852 mientras tanto en extremadura nos encontramos con las vergonzosas diferencias salariales que nuevamente denunciamos
4762853 sencillamente dicha realidad est asentada en la comunidad educativa extreme a y contribuye a la mejora de la calidad del servicio p blico educativo
4762854 continuaremos con las movilizaciones hasta alcanzar un calendario de equiparaci n real en los t rminos que demandan de forma ampliamente mayoritaria los docentes e invitamos a las organizaciones sociales a participar en dicho empe o en lugar de firmar un acuerdo que ata de pies y manos durante tres a os m s al sector
4762855 im really happy for the players it was obviously a very difficult week for them and just as importantly im really happy for our fans
4762856 myself and the players get to come and work on what didnt go right last weekend
4762857 the fans were sort of a little bit powerless in that position so it would have been a tough week for them
4762858 im really pleased and obviously thankful for the people that did turn up tonight
4762859 there was no pre indicator at all as to what happened
4762860 i think we did a fair job of moving on pretty quickly but you cant say that you havent been conscious of it most minutes of most days
4762861 you could probably just cut and paste the last four weeks
4762862 except tonight i thought we got a couple of dud decisions as well get the best of foxtel
4762863 but if we had not stepped in i believe they would be totally broke right now
4762864 and some of them are just really insistent on responding to these scams
4762865 you need to go back and educate your citizens its not like someone is holding a gun to their head theyre freely sending their money
4762866 fraud is one of the few crimes where victims can choose not to participate
4762867 thats why we spend a lot of time doing consumer awareness to fight fraud
4762868 it wouldnt be funny at all if you understood the situation we deal with and persons with disabilities deal with on a daily basis
4762869 hollywood in its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
4762870 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
4762871 they use it for name calling and to get laughs at the expense of persons with developmental disabilities
4762872 we would love to pull it if it was that simple we would have already had it done
4762873 we are sorry it is offensive to them the movie theater owners feel bad they dont want to hurt anybodys feelings
4762874 significant errors and deficiencies in the procurement we have protested thus far
4762875 i have four children i am caring for and this saved me a lot i could not have done it without help
4762876 my husband is not working and his dad has been sick
4762877 the late frank erwin program founder believed kids should start the year off on a good foot with a new pair of shoes
4762878 we are having trouble keeping the shelves stocked with food
4762879 im looking for customer service or data entry jobs but theres no work in there
4762880 im now just trying to get my education for clinical medical assisting theres always a need for medical assistants
4762881 i faxed my resume to three jobs i saw advertised and im just waiting to see if they went through
4762882 in the first half thanks to housing the economy couldnt miss and the unemployment rate plunged to the low 3 percent range
4762883 in the second half due to housing again the economys gone cold and the unemployment rate has soared
4762884 anybody wholl hire me so i can make some money
4762885 ive sort of kind of got a job but nothing steady
4762886 i have never seen a case so blown out of proportion
4762887 im trying to help get these people their life back
4762888 the housing bust is fully upon us and the job losses associated with this housing bust continue to accrue and are showing up in these unemployment figures
4762889 is strengthening floridas economy by providing vital support to our states businesses and job seekers
4762890 this isnt a broad scale across the board unemployment situation there still are areas doing well
4762891 like i saw him yesterday and he gave me the biggest hug
4762892 its going to be crazy going to school and him like not being there
4762893 if youre a fair minded christian youve got to consider those issues
4762894 the culture is going in a direction we dont like
4762895 most of it i think is a figment of the media
4762896 there will be a whole heap of new songs something unexpected i try to bring some creativity to di people something different from the regular
4762897 this album definitely shows growth its a new style new growth in my career steps from step out to now i will continue to do my best
4762898 its hard to release an album on your own i need help more time vp is a really well experienced company they are more upfront more money they know these people and locations that i dont know at all
4762899 i dont depend on sales i want the message and exposure so that my music can bring me on an international market level like shaggy sean paul shabba
4762900 im pretty upset when i get back to the village its probably going to set in
4762901 silver is silver i once heard an athlete say that his silver tasted like gold
4762902 to me silver is silver bronze is bronze and gold is gold
4762903 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started
4762904 by creating lwuit sun is reaffirming its commitment to the mobile development community and by open sourcing the lwuit code we are enabling mobile developers to quickly and easily create rich portable interfaces for their applications functionality that they have been requesting for some time
4762905 the best product in the world is worthless without its users they make or break the product
4762906 one of the ways in which you can help us is by advocating and informing other developers about lwuit this is something we cant do on our own
4762907 i pray by the moon i pray by the moon i pray by the mooon but i did not do a ritual last night
4762908 weve having more of an artistic collaboration than anything else
4762909 unfortunately when we were touring together in australia thats when ub40 were having trouble with their frontman ali campbell leaving
4762910 they had been booked for a lot of different gigs and so they were in a bit of a difficult situation and they asked me if i could help out the situation and i said no problem
4762911 who has been singing in bars and pubs and who has rehearsed with the band but still has inexperience with the road and the sort of audience we play to
4762912 he can handle himself vocally though he is alis replacement and i have come as an intermediary between ali and duncan adding some fuel to the energy of the band everyone is happy and everyone is moving forward
4762913 i dont know too many people who dont know the song
4762914 we just pick that song for everyone to collaborate on stage as a finale sort of thing that worked out so well they decided to record it
4762915 i mean i know all the words and sang all the right lines
4762916 but i see bob as more of a folk singer and uh im more of a singer
4762917 but if you had asked me if i was worried about covering a luther vandross or a marvin gaye song then maybe i could see what youre saying bobs songs are folk songs and theyre so well known its almost like you own it
4762918 i wouldnt do it for no other reason than a spiritual one
4762919 which is likely why i havent done one yet when i do one the focus wont be on trying to do business i want to think of it as soaring my spirit
4762920 i think anyone whos turned off by my gospel music something wrong with them
4762921 the sex workers i have met prefer the term it is a better descriptor of what they do work and it highlights the fact that many people in the sex industry work in several different places in the sex industry
4762922 well i guess we need to change our mission statement to say sex workers
4762923 people just arent going to be in position to have a lot of disposable income so theyre going to be more cautious in what they spend
4762924 i dont want to overreact but i want to be prudent
4762925 no increased property taxes no additional borrowing and no expanded gambling
4762926 wed like to be able to get though the election cycle and worst case scenario have a budget cutting session prior to the regular session
4762927 it is going to be a significant hole to fill
4762928 its hopefully going to be the seven justices of the supreme court reviewing that decision
4762929 clear but inaccurate impression that state revenues will replace all eliminated school property tax revenues
4762930 fair notice of the content and sweep of the proposal
4762931 what really matters is what the last ruling is not the first one
4762932 i hope it stays on the ballot because i like the will of the people i want them to weigh in
4762933 if youre a fair minded christian youve got to consider those issues
4762934 the culture is going in a direction we dont like
4762935 most of it i think is a figment of the media
4762936 until further clarification is received cast members at those facilities will be allowed to keep a gun locked in their personal vehicle as long as they have a concealed weapons permit the gun is not visible and the gun is not removed from the vehicle or exhibited for any reason other than lawful defensive purposes
4762937 our office has been in discussions with them about their original policy and the exemption they were claiming based on those conversations disney has issued a new policy that narrows the focus of the exemption they are claiming and we believe this new policy complies with the law
4762938 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4762954 i dont think it would save the city any money how would they service large areas i just dont think it would work on a scale as large as the city is

4762956 im a big fan i love your work im absolutely certain
4762957 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4762958 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4762959 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4762965 its there in the polyrhythms and the interlocking guitar lines and melodies and also in the idea that everyone is playing all the time
4762966 were influenced by african music on lots of different levels but were not trying to sound like an african band or imitate them in any way that wouldnt really make much sense
4762967 started out as a sort of mad project of terrie the other guitar player from the ex because he traveled in africa for a year and he spent a month in ethiopia at the end of the travel
4762968 when we first decided to play there i think terrie and i went on ahead in january or april and said wed like to come back the next year in january
4762969 people said oh thats too long away for us to organize anything you should just show up in january with your instruments and in the end thats actually how we did it
4762970 it was more his idea to do this record and then the tour
4762971 every year i wonder what im gonna do next year with the ex but we kind of imagine that we can continue doing this for the rest of our lives because weve come this far and why would we suddenly lose the spirit
4762972 we genuinely look forward to it each year and we constantly redefine what were doing every time we rehearse again we throw out all the old songs and start again and by doing that you feel a bit like youre a new band each time you start even though its the same musicians because were not relying on all these old songs that keeps it really fresh though its a bit tough for the audience sometimes because they never get to sing along each time they get to know the cds were not playing them anymore but for us its really vital and necessary i just think songs have a kind of life in them a certain amount of battery power and then once the battery runs out you have to leave them alone
4762973 you might think that draws energy away from the band but it doesnt
4762974 i get other ideas from other musicians and i can always bring that back to the ex that is what keeps us creative
4762975 the first definition we have of success is that we feel we can make great music at a concert we dont think about cds
4762976 we go into this practice room to rehearse and the biggest goal that we have is to make a great live set
4762977 a lot of bands measure their success by they always have to get bigger and bigger we dont really feel like we need to get bigger our audience has pretty much stayed the same for 29 years and its enough for us to survive its a little bit difficult sometimes we live a bit on the edge but its enough this thing were doing with getatchew is one of the biggest things weve done and thats alright but next year well be back playing in small clubs in germany or france well be on to doing a new project and that will be fine too
4762978 but it does feel good when you go do a gig and two years later you come back and one guy says after i saw your gig i started a band or i did this or i left my job of course we didnt prompt that change we were just a sort of catalyst that set it going
4762979 i saw a georgian soldier throw a grenade into a basement full of women and children
4762980 my agent said we found out youre doing a movie in spain do you want to meet p nelope we met in new york a very short meeting which took less than one minute and he told me i saw volver and im writing this story its not finished yet but if it keeps going in this direction the script i think you could be right for this part he didnt tell me anything more about the story or the characters but i felt like we connected we were laughing and when i left the people who work with him told me youve been there for such a long time
4762981 you can trust the director youre working with woody allen youre working with a genius but that doesnt mean youre not going to be doubting yourself
4762982 no the opposite i think one of the worst things that can happen to someone is to feel trapped in your own head like maria elena feels shes stuck in the role of the victim somebody told her when she was growing up that she was a genius and that she was too special to be happy that if she wanted to stay special she had to torture herself shes believed those ideas its not in the movie but i wonder who that person was who ruined her head forever and she has believed it and she keeps feeding the monster because everyone all the time is telling her how special she is but she thinks that to maintain that she has to keep destroying herself its like a circle that just keeps going nowhere and i found her to be a character that really suffers thats stuck in a place and doesnt know how to come out of that so for me you ask me if its not so human i think the opposite
4762983 i feel even more compassion for people who live in that place in their heads people who really feel trapped
4762984 well it helped that we had worked together before in the prestige we were immediately familiar we werent friends we hadnt really spent any time to become friends before we didnt hang out consciously in order to create that dynamic we hung out because we got on really well so we didnt really worry about it and it just happened quite naturally
4762985 i loved it in fact the biggest direction he gave me was do it again and say it in your own words say something different thats fun to do as an actor a lot of the time but its harder to do when its woody allen and the writing is so great but he wanted you to say it in your own words so i didnt feel like that at all
4762986 i dont feel like human emotions change that much maybe if you talk to him allen about e mail or talked about downloading something but i think otherwise allens pretty spot on
4762987 a little bit of all of that yeah i would not want to play that role but for woody allen would do anything
4762988 i saw the film in cannes which was a completely overwhelming experience
4762989 i hear youre shooting in barcelona with p nelope cruz if i could be of any help ill do craft service ill pull focus not very well but
4762990 i knew a few little things they were saying i did take spanish actually
4762991 i do think about it of course i think we all kind of wonder what happened because its so open ended im assuming cristina probably went on to more of these intense i mean her idea that only unfulfilled love could be romantic is sad of course in my mind
4762992 then the company starts to look inward and becomes a rigid rule based organization detached from a dynamic marketplace by now the creative talent needing a flexible environment has left the company goes into decline and eventually dies
4762993 refusal to be creative is self will and is counter to our true nature
4762994 a bad book is as much of a labour to write as a good one it comes as sincerely from the authors soul
4762995 we dont think up the word order first and then speak those words
4762996 dont you think you have to put your intuitive side to sleep in order to be rational
4762997 logical understanding of concepts phyiscal intuition to select key features long period of rumination flash of inspiration test by logic repeat ad nauseum
4762998 science tries to do this too of course and so it certainly functions as mythology even if it is more universal in some sense than other mythologies
4762999 the very act of asking a question seems to presuppose a possible answer
4763000 but i also think its worth digging under the surface to work out what is going on
4763001 i love these textures of yours this weeks wallpaper btw talk about skill ive tried to produce wispy folds like this and failed miserably how do ya do it

4763264 and asked me if i wanted to dance out of the blue i said yes because intuition knows better than we do it is far ahead of us in thinking and behaving as we started to know each other a bit i did a little dance for her and after i kissed her goodbye it stayed in my mind and started to grow there and thats why she asked me
4763265 i have always loved movement and been fascinated by it since i was at school
4763266 i read the french philosopher henri bergson who talks about it a lot he said everything is movement and thats true there is just one tiny little piece in us which is immobile but everything else moves thats why we try to hang on closely to people and to emotions but life is not like that at all its moving all the time for me moving towards akram is what it came to be about if i could never act again i wouldnt mind
4763267 right also we try to compartmentalise our lives me i dont know my path im living my life as im walking sometimes i want to go and see a psychic i try not to we have to resist these temptations
4763268 yes but also because it would give us a sense of assignment about what we are going to do with our lives which is completely crazy
4763269 she has always been doing something she never did before
4763270 and so this makes sense in the context of knowing her
4763271 trained dancers have a terrific skill but that skill can also be a curse whats great about juliette is that if she had studied ballet or contemporary dance then she would only improvise through those channels but she hasnt in a way there is less to discover with a trained ballerina because you are working through a vocabulary that you already know
4763272 that through art i dare to love more than in a relationship
4763273 8 or 9 my mother bought coats for my sister and me and 100 books of paintings i was fascinated by them and started copying and studying them at school i learnt about the relationship between objects and light then the wind of the movies took me
4763274 we went on crazy adventures i used to paint at night once i was painting in the street and there was a girl living there a drug addict and she would ask me to go and buy drugs for her
4763275 it is the most astonishing piece of creation how come this human being is passing through me such a mysterious moment how come im sure i know this person i feel like when we have kids its a decision of three people they come with their own story their own power a friend of mine said that bringing up children is like going up stairs one step then breathing reaching a certain point then another step thats fine then another and oh my god another after that always on the move
4763276 i always took my children with me when my son was ten i asked him if he wanted to come and we went all round the world changing schools
4763277 there is no hierarchy in life you have to recognise your task early on if you decide you want children you have to take responsibility for them until they fly on their own it doesnt mean i dont make mistakes because i do i want to be perfect of course ive never wanted to say no to my son so i always said yes
4763278 i filmed her a little and we started getting to know each other she said it should be like an exchange breathing in and breathing out so we met the next day warmed up separately and thought about how we could start it became an imitative game its what a child does my sisters son is one year old and tries to say everything in your accent
4763279 we ended up through improvising with one becoming the voice and the head of the other almost like an angel the other person becomes your own inner voice
4763280 we havent touched all the surfaces of getting to know each other
4763281 we have to show each other our demons if i can reveal mine to her then she can reveal hers to me it means that there is an intimacy the way i am with her is not the way i would be in front of you
4763282 i said to her my wife when she and i kiss how would you feel about that she said youll know when to stop i trust you if you bring her into your real life youll know where the line is drawn that gave me the confidence
4763283 this is a first for me this finding of a balance between us its almost like getting married then learning to know each other after the contract is made
4763284 like painting its not about talking its about doing it
4763285 we know exactly what that play is when you put a choreographer into a theatre you have no idea what he is going to write this exists somewhere in between and these devised shows are always nerve racking it would be idle to pretend its not alluring to have such a great movie star here but this came about because of her relationship with akram

4763291 this website is just what i have been looking for for ages but did not even know it have become weary of other sites etc they never really properly address the psychological components all the subtleties a nyway thanks so much for existing i have been telling my friends hope your website sticks around forever
4763292 first of all all you guys should check out this website articles very valuable insights im taken by this site
4763293 u ntil 2 days ago i thought i was a crazy abnormal taken in hand website i have never felt such relief such internal peace in my life this whole idea of being loved and trusting enough in another to place my his and our well being into his hands was exactly what i have been searching for my whole life i spent 16 hours just reading it is like a huge weight has lifted off my shoulders
4763294 there are lots of websites for people in the bdsm d s dd domestic discipline and spanking communities there are websites for people who belong to religions that advocate male head of household marriage there are even websites for christians who are interested in bdsm but there are very few websites for people who are interested in male led intimate relationships but who are not interested in all that the above communities associate with this kind of relationship jargon clothes etc some of us dont even like thinking of this as a lifestyle if you are interested in this kind of relationship but are not interested in bdsm or d s or dd or spanking websites theres a new website for you taken in hand is really the most beautiful website
4763295 t he whole damn site really is one of the most well articulated pro con loaded blogs ive seen it provides a cross section of how people are feeling out there even amongst those who are seemingly natural allies
4763296 as i view it im a control freak i love to be in control however i fantasize about that control being stripped from me and handed over to someone else namely my husband im just glad i found a site that makes me realize im not a freak for wanting a taken in hand a very thoughtful and well written group blog im looking forward to reading through this blog the way i look forward to reading a new novel by a favorite author it looks that good
4763297 thank you for providing such a positive validating place for like minded people to talk about this in a way that affirms the dignity of both men and women
4763298 it indicates that early eating patterns have effects that persist over time regardless of later changes in diet so it is very important for children to eat a well balanced diet from an early age if they are to get the best out of their education
4763299 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4763300 as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
4763301 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
4763302 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
4763303 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
4763304 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
4763305 children who are dangerously overweight should be brought into hospital where they can be given 24 hour care for several weeks or months but their parents should have access to them
4763306 it would be better to help the parents provide better nutrition for their child rather than break up the family

4763409 dr grordbort was born three or four years and just grew out of the rayguns themselves because they were the first things i did i started a series of paintings for myself just in my spare time i would do these paintings to put on my wall which i still havent actually got around to putting on my wall funnily enough i would do these paintings and when i did each one i would give it a little bit of back story give it a manufacturer and they started becoming something so i invented dr grodbort to be either the designer or the distributer of all these weapons and from that i ended up writing a catalogue dr grodborts contrapulatronic dingus directory which is coming out in january through darkhorse that allowed me to write the backstory and the world of these rayguns and not just these rayguns but all the inventions and accoutrements that dr grordbort would make or sell its like a 1920s 1930s style sears amp roebuck catalogue of inventions and contraptions and deathtraps and spaceships and just all this junk that dr grodbort sells its all products but its all written so you get an insight into the background of the world through the context of their advertising writing on top of that i managed to fit a 12 page comic of a character called lord cockswain which is one of the main characters of dr grordborts universe he is a great white hunter adventurer character a great big buffoon of a man who goes to venus to wreak havoc on the wildlife there and destroy it all with dr grordborts rayguns

4763485 some of the messages really got you in the throat
4763486 our performances are more about the art of burlesque we try to stay true to what burlesque was back in its heyday the sometimes frilly sometimes shiny and always sexy burlesque costumes help turn back the clock and bring back the pin up era if only during the performances whether its a fan dance a snake charmer skit a holiday inspired routine or the classic shimmy vintage burlesque groups like babes in sin are the intelligent alternative to the modern girls gone wild burlesque has more visual foreplay and as cha cha pictured right notes
4763487 for me its been great being part of this troupe has really done a lot for me i have an outlet to be creative though my choreography and costume design i really have fun with my numbers i try to add a little humor or a trick to my performances i am also know to twirl my tassel like no other

4763499 i think that the most important message that needs to go out is a simple one force is not the basis for resolving difficult issues and is not the basis for international relations in the 21st century
4763500 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming

4763502 looking back at the season so far it feels like a different championship compared to last year 2007 was very intense and consistency was incredibly important
4763503 this year everybodys results have been more varied and every driver who has won a race has also failed to score on at least two other occasions
4763504 thats made getting strong results even more important but i think well see consistency becoming crucial as we head towards the end of the season
4763505 im wary of making predictions the race in hungary showed just how unpredictable formula 1 can be and thats one of the reasons why its such a fascinating sport
4763506 clearly though i am still in a good position to challenge for the world championship and that remains my aim
4763507 we still feel confident about our chances we know our rivals will be strong but weve worked hard to improve the car and are confident well be competitive this weekend
4763508 the most important thing is to finish consistently in the points
4763509 our main focus will still be the three free practice sessions ahead of qualifying
4763510 ill be working closely with my engineers to make sure we start the weekend with a good baseline and work hard to strengthen it as we go through the weekend

4763521 we are interested in the american boy and we are trying to get him
4763522 but that depends on a work permit so it will be a few days before we know about that
4763523 we had asked maurice johnston if he thought there were any players in the american league whom he thought would do well and he recommended two or three players
4763524 the clubs dont own the players over there so the mls are happy to let him go

4763531 this is something thats done in unions all across the country
4763532 the reality is that if you look at the voting records and questionnaires weve received from the candidates the issues that our members tell us they care about like health insurance benefits and wages democrats have been much more supportive
4763533 it was one of the ways the budget was balanced
4763534 theres been enough interest in it each year that it has been maintained
4763535 i think the employer should not be asking what youre doing on your free time whether theyre sunning themselves in hawaii or going to be working for a political candidate in a union setting we would find it very offensive
4763536 weve saved him some money by having somebody not work
4763537 it is time for liverpool to make their move in the premier league
4763538 rafa benitez arrived in england at the same time as i did and is beginning his fifth year at the club
4763539 it has been the same group of players and the same management structure for the past four years
4763540 weaknesses are exposed in that time frame and dealt with
4763541 it is impossible to win the championship without a world class goalkeeper and a world class striker and liverpool have both
4763542 no matter how better you say it women in islam are second class citizens especially when it comes to the
4763543 if any of your women are guilty of lewdness take the evidence of four reliable witnesses from amongst you against them and if they testify confine them to houses until death do claim them or allah ordain for them some other way
4763544 and those who launch a charge against chaste women and produce not four witnesses to support their allegations flog them with eighty stripes and reject their evidence ever after for such men are wicked transgressors
4763545 and for those who launch a charge against their spouses and have in support no evidence but their own their solitary evidence can be received if they bear witness four times with an oath by allah that they are solemnly telling the truth and the fifth oath should be that they solemnly invoke the curse of allah on themselves if they tell a lie but it would avert the punishment from the wife if she bears witness four times with an oath by allah that her husband is telling a lie and the fifth oath should be that she solemnly invokes the wrath of allah on herself if her accuser is telling the truth
4763546 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4763547 with it comes an incredible responsibility to treat employees well and have competitive wages and benefits
4763548 thats a strong indicator that this is a good place to work
4763549 its even more disturbing cause its right here at home
4763550 when these types of crimes happen against children theyre reluctant to talk about it
4763551 were proud of the courage theyve presented and come forward and talked
4763552 we feel strongly about the evidence and anticipate there will be additional charges
4763553 certainly it is sickening and troubling that this is going on anywhere and especially in our neighborhood its even more disturbing right here at home but weve done a very diligent investigation
4763554 its even more disturbing cause its right here at home

4763562 the 34th peshmerga brigade will leave diyala to join the 15th mountain division within kurdistan
4763563 the tribunal erred in law and failed to exercise its discretion judicially thereby occasioning a miscarriage of justice when it rejected in evidence the certified true copies of voters register issued by inec for some polling units in apoi wards in the ese odo local government area

4763565 do you believe we have a human right to healthcare
4763566 sixty years ago in the universal declaration of human rights the nations of the world including the u s declared that everyone has a basic human right to medical care and security in the event of sickness or disability
4763567 sadly that right is not respected in the u s the wealthiest country in the world

4763574 skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4763575 russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
4763576 russia also holds vast petroleum wealth and this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that russia is clearly prepared to use
4763577 all of this only adds to the urgency of producing more of our own energy including americas enormous oil reserves that lie offshore
4763578 on energy policy my opponent and his allies in congress offer only half measures or no measures at all as in their shared opposition to offshore drilling

4763599 telling him that someones turned on by you will be a turn on for him

4763612 durante mucho tiempo el tabaco burley misionero no ha sido reconocido con precios satisfactorios para el productor este a o se avanz en algo con el precio pero est lejos de ser el que verdaderamente le corresponder a recibir al que produce un tabaco de excelente calidad reconocido internacionalmente como uno de los mejores cumpliendo con todos los requerimientos de los compradores llevando adelante programas de buenas pr cticas agr colas utilizando insumos que le solicitan nuestro productor fue un adelantado en la eliminaci n del bromuro de metilo est reduciendo el consumo de agroqu micos a trav s de un programa manejo integrado de plagas y enfermedades que es nico a nivel mundial

4763620 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant

4763854 its a matter of health and taking care of the gymnast
4763855 i think i can make the point this way try to put a 12 year old boy in a formula one car and see what happens
4763856 there was quite a bit of media attention especially in europe about these young children comparing them to kids that used to work in the coal mines in the 18th and 19th century
4763857 in many ways it was a knee jerk reaction from the gymnastics federation to remind coaches to not push so hard
4763858 but im not sure thats really worked im not sure if in the gym that causes a coach to back off a little maybe it does
4763859 the logic makes sense but im not sure it works
4763860 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4763861 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4763862 its so befitting of michael to do it like that i won a race by a hundredth of a second like he did and im not giving my medal back
4763863 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4763864 this thing michael did is probably going to spur a lot more life into me
4763865 i was going to be trite and say to him and ask him this question what was the most difficult race and when did you know you had a chance to win seven gold medals
4763866 i dont have to it was tonight and it was epic
4763867 i think hes got a real future in our business
4763868 to have won at least silver is already an achievement in this respect there is no other athlete in the olympic village who has won two olympic medals in two different events
4763869 but its not finished yet and im not going to be content with that i have the gold medal to look forward to and im not going to let it go
4763870 since the worlds i was a little bit out of luck picking the wrong tactics but i kept working hard and it paid off
4763871 i think i can get confidence from the fact that im on the way up now i must prove to myself that i can be the best
4763872 i think there is a bit of a shock here at how strong we are there were the worlds in 2007 the worlds in march and everybody kept asking can they move up another gear have not they peaked too soon
4763873 i had to play three matches in less than 24 hours
4763874 i had a little bit of anger about that so i just put everything out on the tennis court
4763875 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4763876 i didnt beat phelps but perhaps im the only guy at this competition who had a shot at beating phelps one on one
4763877 i knew that i was leading the race after the first 50 i usually do and i knew that michael is fast in the second 50 and he would be chasing me
4763878 i think if we got to do this again i would win it
4763879 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4763880 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4763881 there is a gold medal at stake but i came into this expecting bronze and i did one better and got silver and almost the gold
4763882 but im taking what i got and im very happy
4763883 i almost won the gold and if you ask me the clock does not lie
4763884 if you ask me it should be accepted and we should move on
4763885 ive accepted defeat and theres nothing wrong with losing to the greatest swimmer there has ever been
4763886 losing by a hundredth of a second is difficult its the hardest loss but its a complete miracle im here considering i was going to retire a year and a half ago
4763887 from my heart im enjoying it and i wish i had a gold medal but im happy with a silver
4763888 i had to help my people knowing it could be a big risk for my swimming career im proud of what i did
4763889 i had to do it to help the kosovo serbs knowing how hard it is for them there
4763890 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4763891 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4763892 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4763893 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4763894 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4763895 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4763896 they stood ramrod straight on parade desperate to impress the vip after all
4763897 todos os recordes do mundo pertencem a chuck norris n s apenas nos damos o trabalho de listar os segundos colocados em cada categoria
4763898 russia is such a strong team they have so much experience
4763899 they are tough to hit we held it together and then kind of hesitated a little bit you want to rush and get points but theyre a team that you cant do that with
4763900 we have received a call from kenya that cheruiyot cannot make it here due to an injury we are saddened by the development but we have to accept it reluctantly
4763901 its insane now more than 100 bands to play three stages
4763902 you can take the mask off the lone ranger and put it on someone else but it aint the lone ranger
4763903 its so befitting of michael to do it like that i won a race by a hundredth of a second like he did and im not giving my medal back
4763904 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4763905 this thing michael did is probably going to spur a lot more life into me
4763906 i was going to be trite and say to him and ask him this question what was the most difficult race and when did you know you had a chance to win seven gold medals
4763907 i dont have to it was tonight and it was epic
4763908 i think hes got a real future in our business
4763909 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4763910 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4763911 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4763912 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4763913 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4763914 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4763915 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4763916 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4763917 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4763918 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4763919 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4763920 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4763921 who are open to doing something on the production side
4763922 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4763923 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4763924 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4763925 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4763926 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4763927 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4763928 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4763929 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4763930 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4763931 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4763932 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4763933 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4763934 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4763935 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4763936 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4763937 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4763938 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4763939 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4763940 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4763941 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4763942 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4763943 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4763944 its insane now more than 100 bands to play three stages
4763945 you can take the mask off the lone ranger and put it on someone else but it aint the lone ranger
4763946 well the first track that we recorded for that was fill your head with rock for the swedenrock festival cd then i got thinking that with the tour coming up in the uk with y amp t in september id like to have something else to offer people that already had playground for life and the first album there was a bit of material that i wanted to record anyway and having something new to go with a tour always creates a better buzz
4763947 i dont know if you know brewin up a storm there was a band called the stunning from galway who had a hit single with this in 1990 so thats actually a cover we play it in our covers band so we decided to record it its got a kind of doors vibe with the keyboards and tonys voice in the low register
4763948 yeah i wrote that song around 1999 with a friend of mine glyder played it in the early days but we didnt do anything else with it so we decided it should go on the ep i used to play in a thrash metal band when i was a teenager but i gave up on the rock n roll dream and started playing in a covers band i still continued to write bits and pieces here and there and every now and again id get inspired to do something original again because for me thats where the buzz is i had an idea to make an album based around bram stokers dracula and recorded two songs love never dies and the dead travels fast i then forgot about them but when glyder happened a couple of years later i brought a few songs and ideas with me even some of the riffs on the first and second albums are things i wrote from years ago the dracula thing was just a crazy idea at the time but nothing ever came of it
4763949 its insane now more than 100 bands to play three stages
4763950 you can take the mask off the lone ranger and put it on someone else but it aint the lone ranger
4763951 we never had any plan of any kind really a lot of people didnt think we would last this long you dont think like that when youre starting a band youre just starting a band to see what happens its very gratifying to still be around
4763952 its like another planet isnt it people thought different people looked different people did things differently people philosophized differently about their fate it was just different and hasnt changed for the better yknow laughs aint it funny how things never seem to change for the better they improve things and theyre always worse
4763953 its insane now more than 100 bands to play three stages
4763954 you can take the mask off the lone ranger and put it on someone else but it aint the lone ranger
4763955 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4763956 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4763957 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4763958 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4763959 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4763960 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4763961 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4763962 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4763963 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4763964 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4763965 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4763966 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4763967 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4763968 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4763969 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4763970 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4763971 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4763972 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4763973 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4763974 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4763975 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4763976 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4763977 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4763978 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4763979 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4763980 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4763981 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4763982 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4763983 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4763984 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4763985 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4763986 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4763987 it is not merely that god has the power and right to govern all things but that he does so always and without exception
4763988 but after experiencing it ive never felt like this i would give anything to feel that again
4763989 its not like were worried about the minor league options the other issue is we have a lot of free agents and have some room if it would have been a really tight roster it would have been much more difficult
4763990 he played first most of the time at miami but miami had a good third baseman
4763991 we think he can play third base he can definitely play first he may be able to play third
4763992 baseball is a red blooded sport for red blooded men its no pink tea and mollycoddles had better stay out its a struggle for supremacy a survival of the fittest
4763993 we have only one way to solve this problem we must create more complex d spaces

4764023 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4764024 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4764025 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4764026 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4764027 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4764028 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4764029 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4764030 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4764031 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4764032 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4764033 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4764034 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4764035 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4764036 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4764037 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4764038 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4764073 the security in iraq is improving but its still dangerous because bad people remain out there no matter where the bad guys are were going to find them and were going to get them
4764074 if we make a difference in one soldiers life and possibly that of his or her children we have been successful but to impact so many soldiers and families is simply overwhelming and fills the heart with pride
4764075 its a wonderful blessing to be able to read to my daughter on video receive a video in return and be able to watch her sit and follow along with the book
4764076 it helps with the separation and i get to help teach her to read at the same time
4764077 many soldiers do not have the time to come to our reading room so we take our video camera and books to them
4764078 the main idea for this program is simply to keep soldiers in touch with their families the greatest reward however is the knowledge that someone back home will cry smile or laugh as they see their loved one in living color live before them on tv
4764079 there have been over 60 separate tribes represented and these people have now become a part of the future of iraq

4764181 it is unlikely that ossetians and abkhazians will be able to live with georgians in one state

4764212 with the way this team is put together with foreigners and older guys per uci rules we cant keep this team together unless we are pro continental but those have to be put together by october 30 it puts everyone in a tough position we could still have team and team owner sean tucker could hire some of the guys but hes definitely not going to be able to keep everyone together so its kind of the end of an era for this team

4764268 just read below to learn how you can harness the full power advertising
4764269 the day could hardly have got off to a better start the conditions were entirely dry again and i think the soft pirelli tyres for the three saarland stages ss7 ss8 and ss9 was the right call
4764270 we then switched to the harder option for the concrete and paving of ss10 through the baumholder military camp after the rsz and that too paid off
4764271 we have succeeded in meeting the objective we set ourselves this morning which was to extend our lead even further before returning to trier for service we still had to push hard though
4764272 however like yesterday i had an excellent feeling with my car over all four stages although we did have one scary moment about a kilometre before the end of ss9 when we came across a hay bail chicane that had been put in a different place compared with recce the spot was on a fast section and came just after a blind crest it was a very close thing and i was fortunate to escape with just a scratched front right wing
4764273 some veteran russian human rights activists have criticized russias attack on georgia unequivocally
4764274 georgia as an osce member has an obligation to resolve conflicts with peaceful measures
4764275 restoring the territorial integrity of the government cannot be grounds for the dismissal of such responsibilities war operations in south ossetia should be rapidly halted the path of negotiations will be long and difficult but this is the only way can lasting peace be attained
4764276 we call for the immediate stop of aggression against georgia
4764277 we consider that russias leadership having set another bloody stain to the countrys reputation finally made its presence in the group of eight unacceptable from a moral point of view
4764278 today it is short sighted to concentrate solely on criticism of georgian president saakashvili
4764279 to demand an immediate cease fire and start of talks is correct but insufficient if we want to eliminate the risk of repeating similar tragic situations in the future the russian authority must bear responsibility for its actions before its citizens
4764280 the president and prime minister would do well to explain why the government is issuing tens of thousands of russian passports in the territory of a neighboring country with which we maintain normal diplomatic relations why are the key posts in the south ossetian government and security services occupied by career russian civil servants and military personnel why after an attack on russian peacekeepers by the superior forces of the opponent in tskhinvali did the official establishment stand in a state of stupor for several hours and didnt rush to provide military assistance what does the kremlin want to achieve by escalating the conflict with georgia and expanding the theater of military operations
4764281 historical experience shows that the interference of our country in someone elses affairs inevitably and contrary to any claims of assistance leads to innumerable misfortunes
4764282 the incursion into afghanistan led to many years of unceasing widespread violence and human rights abuses as well as flare ups of war again and again the historical development of afghanistan turned completely around from a secular government it turned into a theocratic one the actions of the soviet leadership led to a sharp rise in the popularity of islamic fundamentalism not only in afghanistan but in pakistan and arab countries as well remember the alliance between the taliban and al qaeda

4764367 i thought it was a golden day for britain due to hull citys first appearance in top flight football
4764368 yup talking up the golden day can only end in tears
4764369 i know this because there have been a whole host of australian swimmers who were meant to cruise home in gold theyve been performing quite under par which is of course amusing and provides me and others with much ammo for the office they are of course still miles ahead in the table
4764370 tvnz is also treating today as a possible golden day because theres the rowing and the cycling and valerie vili appears to be on good form in the shot put
4764371 basically nz is now desperate to get on the medals table full stop but mahe drysdales got a funny tummy and is dehydrated so that might not help the chances and vilis the best bet at the moment
4764372 she has raised the profile of mansfield and provides inspiration for other youngsters in the town

4764377 so far the only golds the aussies have won have been in the swimming and rowing
4764378 its almost as if theyre desperately trying to get off their large island i hope they dont discover sailing
4764379 whats impressive is how the rowing coaches ride bikes along the towpath to observe the crews

4764440 the question was him to share or not to share
4764441 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that cost me the race
4764442 but it turned out to be exactly what i needed
4764443 to lose by a hundreth of a second is the most difficult loss you can have especially at the olympics and i did see the replays
4764444 but if you ask me i am not about fighting it
4764445 i think the biggest thing is when someone says you cant do something when there have been quotes in the paper saying it is impossible to ever tie or break this record it just shows you anything is possible
4764446 when you put your mind to something and really focus on doing it anything is possible
4764447 when i saw the replay when i did take that extra half stroke i thought that i had lost the race
4764448 but i guess when i took that half stroke that is what i needed
4764449 hes one of the rare guys who can win by huge gaps and when the race is close hes got the drive to keep going

4764458 at the beginning i was lagging behind i feel my dream has come true
4764459 i can confirm that there were two babies transferred up from the lethbridge regional hospital but flesh eating disease is a specific diagnosis and the organism was not isolated in either baby
4764460 they were both transferred up with significant infections but to say they are symptoms of flesh eating disease thats just alarmist kind of language
4764461 our involvement from the ministry is to see what is going on and theres been nothing to suggest a breach of proper infection control measures
4764462 we havent been able to find any reason why these babies developed the infection
4764463 im told two things that its neither classified nor secret and that its stuff that could be available under access to information
4764464 priester achimelek help mij geef mij brood en een wapen ik ben op een belangrijke missie voor koning saul
4764465 tuurlijk maar het enige brood dat ik heb ik gewijdbrood van de priesters neem dat als je wilt en het enige wapen hier is het zwaard van goliath
4764466 dit is het koninklijk paleis van mispe u spreekt met assistente nummer 5 wat kan ik voor u doen
4764467 hallo met david kunt u mij door verbinden met de koning alstublieft
4764468 hallo met david ik vroeg mij af of u mij een plezier kon doen
4764469 ik vraag u of mijn familie en vrienden in moab kunnen blijven tot ik weet wat ik moet doen en of u ze hier onderdak kan geven en beschermen tot dat ik terug ben
4764470 mijn god geef mij raad ik heb vernomen dat saul een leger bijeen roept en richting ke la op zal rukken zal hij dit daadwerklijk doen
4764471 de heer beware mij ervoor dat ik zijne majesteit gods eigen koning zoiets zou aandoen en mij aan hem zou vergrijpen de heer heeft hem toch tot koning gezalfd
4764472 kijk mijn vader kijk hier heb ik een stuk van uw mantel ik heb het van uw mantel afgesneden maar ik heb u niet gedood erken dus dat ik geen kwade of opstandige bedoelingen heb ik heb u niets misdaan en toch stelt u alles in het werk om mij van het leven te beroven
4764473 they have tested me four times and took a lot of blood
4764474 im saying they are taking so much blood i might be very weak for the saturday finals of the 100 meters
4764475 asafa told me i took a lot of pressure off him
4764476 i feel ready for the crowd the stadium and the atmosphere i am going there to win the gold medal and have been working for this goal so long now it is all i think about i wont be fazed when i get there
4764477 you look back and he did phenomenal things at 14 15 16 17 years old
4764478 after sorry the emotions have calmed now to deal with the reality
4764479 if he fails to decide to quit within the next two days the impeachment process will take its course
4764480 it will be in the interest of the country and the nation to make him an example in accordance with the constitution and the law
4764481 never indulges in the politics of revenge as it wants a stable pakistan and a sustainable democracy in the country
4764482 a small circulation non commercial publication of original or appropriated texts and images
4764483 the timing system says it all there hasnt really been an error with the timing system i raced as hard as i could and the scoreboard said i got my hand on the wall first
4764484 when youre really focused on your dream anything is possible i saw so many quotes saying its impossible it wont happen it shows you
4764485 hes the best olympian of all time not just in the pool but in the way hes handled himself
4764486 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4764487 im not angry im not angry at all technology is also imperfect its possible i won it was just a crazy finish its too bad we couldnt have both finished at 50 58 i would have loved to share that gold medal i think if we got to do this again i would win
4764488 and i think it would be good for him if he lost once just once
4764489 when i heard that milorad said it would be good for swimming if i lost it fired me up more than anything
4764490 i know cavic pretty well and i know phelps pretty well and i like cavic but if he had won i would have been pissed
4764491 i said congratulations to michael which doesnt really cut it for the week hes had what do you say to that shake his hand and shake your head and wonder if anyone will ever come close to doing that again not in my lifetime
4764492 he had just signed the settlement plan consisting of the six earlier agreed upon principles
4764493 ways of the post conflict settlement and measures to overcome the consequences of the humanitarian disaster
4764494 now these principles should be accepted by georgia and need to be followed with guarantees from russia the council of europe and the osce the organization for security and cooperation in europe i hope this will happen in the near future we expect relevant information
4764495 u s military transport aircraft are reported to have been airlifting some humanitarian cargoes to tbilisi airport
4764496 the position of the russian federation is unchanged we shall support any decision the people of south ossetia and abkhazia will make in conformity with the united nations charter the international convention of 1966 and the helsinki act on security and cooperation in europe
4764497 i listened to george bushs statement and was surprised the facts he cited are untrue
4764498 the talk focuses on georgian situations and measures that need to be taken to halt the conflict
4764499 i think theres a reasonable expectation by taxpayers that they wont fund the world travel of wealthy rock stars ideological activists or fringe and alternative groups
4764500 i just ran the first 50 meters then i looked around to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4764501 thats why im here if not i wouldve stayed home and watched it on tv
4764502 i would spend 30m on one player but i have the quality
4764503 i am able to make signings at very high prices but you have to have the cohesion in the way you buy man united is in the bracket of 20m 30m chelsea is in the unlimited bracket we have to be in our bracket we have to be very shrewd i have the money available to buy the players but we go into the competition with the target of balancing the budget which i think every manager should do

4764509 hes a closer and has a good fastball i took the first one and i was kind of thinking that was it it was right down the middle i did it again and took a fastball right down the middle now im going to have to really battle and i picked up the release spot early and saw it was another fastball and took a good hack and connected and it felt great
4764510 right there im just trying to make good contact and i crushed the ball
4764511 it takes me time to adjust sometimes and when you pinch hit you get one at bat it might take a week and it seems like forever i was so excited

4764521 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4764522 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4764523 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4764524 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4764525 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4764526 is something i cant be concerned about im concerned about right now and im playing well now
4764527 they called two of my runs back things happen but i know the skys the limit
4764528 he doesnt get tackled by one guy and bounces off players he closes games out and with the assistance of the offensive line makes plays
4764529 he has been a huge surprise i know to me

4764536 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
4764537 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
4764538 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
4764539 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
4764540 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
4764541 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
4764542 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital

4764553 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4764554 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4764555 i was in high school when she hit it big
4764556 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4764557 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4764558 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4764559 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4764560 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4764561 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4764562 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4764563 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4764564 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4764565 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4764566 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4764567 now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint
4764568 sab amos que georgia se preparaba desde hac a tiempo para acciones militares pero lo del d a 8 fue totalmente inesperado
4764569 fue una operaci n con el consenso de estados unidos y as lo estamos dando a entender
4764570 saakashvili prometi a bush una r pida y corta operaci n militar exitosa
4764571 si georgia hubiera ocupado osetia del sur en 24 horas habr an proclamado el restablecimiento del orden constitucional en osetia del sur y washingtron lo habr a sancionado
4764572 el c lculo fue que no habr a una decisi n r pida de respuesta
4764573 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4764574 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4764575 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4764576 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4764577 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4764578 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4764579 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4764580 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4764581 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4764582 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4764583 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4764584 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4764585 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4764586 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4764587 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4764588 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4764589 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4764590 financially its a disaster for us whether we dundrod club can bounce from this remains to be seen
4764591 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4764592 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4764593 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4764594 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4764595 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4764596 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4764597 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4764598 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4764599 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4764600 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4764601 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4764602 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4764603 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4764604 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4764605 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4764606 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4764607 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4764608 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4764609 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4764610 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4764611 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4764612 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4764613 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4764614 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4764615 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4764616 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4764617 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4764618 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4764619 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4764620 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4764621 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4764622 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4764623 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4764624 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4764625 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4764626 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4764627 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4764628 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4764629 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4764630 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4764631 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4764632 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4764633 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4764634 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4764635 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4764636 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4764637 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

4764679 from a distribution standpoint from a technical standpoint it needs to fit without modifications or special handling
4764680 it can be grown anywhere you can have a pool of water and expose it to sunlight
4764681 if anyone is below 50 a gallon id be stunned
4764682 we have a pretty good idea on how to grow algae the biggest challenge is in the harvesting and how to extract it from the water
4764683 you arent going to find a fuel thats pennies on the dollar than what we find today
4764684 even if we were to double the volume we were to make in biofuels every year for the next 10 years were still looking at maybe this will impact 15 percent of the overall fuel supply
4764685 sesungguhnya kau tau bahwa hati ini telah berpadu berhimpun dalam naungan cintamu
4764686 ya no es una cuesti n de si los kirchner ser n derrocados sino de cu ndo lo ser n
4764687 dada la intransigencia de los kirchner s lo es una cuesti n de tiempo para que sean echados
4764688 desafortunadamente los cambios abruptos de poder en la argentina tienden a ser ca ticos esa es la raz n por la cual los mercados anticipan un default aun cuando los indicadores macroecon micos del pa s son consistentes
4764689 esta es una pel cula que ya conocimos bien es muy dif cil que un gobierno que pierde la confianza de la sociedad pueda recuperarla
4764690 la situaci n es bastante mala y dado el camino que transitan los kirchner esto terminar mal ya que desde sus tiempos en santa cruz ellos no cambian de rumbo cuando eso puede ser visto como una se al de debilidad
4764691 no esta vez creo que yo los sigo a ellos que hace tiempo que recomiendan salirse de la argentina
4764692 ellos no hablan de un colapso pol tico pero lo piensan

4764696 we are very fortunate that such a fine group of accomplished musicians have donated their time and talent to honor harry chapin a long island icon
4764697 it offers us an excellent opportunity to enjoy a unique evening of entertainment while supporting a very worthy cause
4764698 my message to him is that samu you are great i saw the goals he scored and i am very pleased that the people applauded him
4764699 i had reports about the game from my father in argentina and then from my team mates by text i did eventually see the goals on television in the hotel and it appeared that we played very well
4764700 he is a striker that guarantees you goals every season and he showed that before he joined bar a too we need a main striker who can do that and the fact that he is our means we do not have to look elsewhere
4764701 he should forget about the past and not worry about what happened but he has to ensure they do not happen again i have never had any problems with etoo
4764702 with all squads you have some players that are better friends with some than others but what is in important is what happens when you play together
4764703 rafa benitez arrived in england at the same time as i did and is beginning his fifth year at the club
4764704 it has been the same group of players and the same management structure for the past four years

4764706 last season when the club bought fernando torres the spine of the team was completed pepe reina jamie carragher steven gerrard and torres
4764707 i think chelsea have improved they have signed some good players they have got a new manager and they will be very hungry
4764708 they have got great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row so its going to be very tough this season
4764709 it will be interesting to see how arsenal do with some of the players they have lost
4764710 i think it could be a tough season but somehow arsene wenger seems to do the business with his young players
4764711 we are going to have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4764712 i certainly hope that its not dying because that would be bad for all of us for society and for our communities but its changing its in a huge upheaval period
4764713 its a surprise that its taken this long to hit des moines and the register

4764716 im not gonna stop reading information on google or the desmoinesregister com but im not giving up my paper either
4764717 it was a dark and stormy night the rain fell in torrents except at occasional intervals when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets for it is in london that our scene lies rattling along the housetops and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness

4764766 i actually saw the apostle paul come walking toward me onto the bridge he was short not more than 51
4764767 as i just stated paul told me that essentially there would be no gospel and there would be no israel without abraham he said too that there would be no gospel without david because there would be no divine son of david in order for the kingdom and his throne to be built upon the throne of david

4764785 santiago calatravas design is an organic form that was conceived in response to the buildings location and its juxtaposition with the city
4764786 the shape of the building is a solution for a number of factors to maximize the aspect of the units as they are arranged on the floor plates and equally to address other engineering challenges like wind and deflection
4764787 the testing that was done on the rock caissons succeeded anything else that has been done in the united states certainly in chicago
4764788 the perimeter component the bathtub is being formed with a combination of slurry walls and secant pile walls and is obviously designed to keep out the water on three sides of this project
4764789 ninety eight bell caissons are being constructed right now that will support the garage elements
4764790 calatrava has done a lot of projects in europe where it has become an everyday event to have a leed type building and to incorporate sustainable components into the design some of the components in the chicago spire are elements that are disguised behind the facade or within the guts of the building
4764791 we are anticipating in excess of 2 000 workers at the complete peak of activities between shell and core and the finishes
4764792 and that doesnt event count the people involved in the creative process on the other side
4764793 the intellectual capital that comes into chicago from all corners of the globe to plan the various portions of the building to the minutia is amazing so not only will there be a small village building this building but you literally have the most amazing brains working on this project from almost every country
4764794 for me it is the top of my career for the moment to be involved in a project like this it is a dream for anybody in real estate or development to have an association with the chicago spire everybody is passionate about delivering the project

4764808 you paint masterpieces master zach would you teach us how to paint like you
4764809 but you must do what i ask you to do
4764810 he handed each of them a large canvas exactly the same size as the one he was working on
4764811 you will do it the way i say to do it
4764812 he demonstrated and added the slightest touch of white and a tiny dab of ochre when he finished on the palette was an exquisite shade of purple the finest most delicate color anyone had seen
4764813 now that you have watched me do this you do exactly what i did
4764814 now you must follow each brush stroke that i make as i paint a sunset
4764815 yes this is good that is it is good for your first try
4764816 while everyone had painted the same sunset only zach had created a masterpiece
4764817 now i want you to see the picture that youve been destined to paint
4764818 ah yes yes that is the picture you were destined to paint
4764819 keep your eyes closed until you picture the little girls face and can focus on that single tear
4764820 i want you to see the picture that youve been destined to paint

4764851 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4764852 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4764853 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4764854 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4764855 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4764856 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4764857 this asset is a potential company maker for kml and we are happy to be given the opportunity to assess the site for acquisition california creek has been held by two well known north queensland tin miners since the last price crash and no operations have been carried out since 1985 this has kept a rich and well planned operation intact during the hard years and we hope to benefit from that good planning while our due diligence target is set at 3000 tonnes our expectations are that we will identify a significant premium on this in and around the leases
4764858 we would like to welcome bernard to the team and to thank mark for the valuable contribution he has made to central petroleum during his time here and to extend to him our best wishes for his future endeavours
4764859 it is refreshing to close a deal like this in such a short period of time it has only been just over two months since we announced the signing of the term sheet for this product asx june 4 2008 we are undertaking the next production run in canada in order to have new stock on the shelves in september and hope to soon complete a production run in australia for a market launch early next year
4764860 we are very happy to have formed a partnership with stirling products petquench tm will now have the opportunity to be truly global and has an outstanding pedigree in the form of stirling animal health sah to support it
4764861 the new company would bring products to the market that are based on the most current and up to date research in animal health sah is a company that has been formed by pet owners in both canada and australia with the support of a truly innovative veterinary pharmaceutical company in australia
4764862 stirling gain access to sales and marketing expertise and additional development experience from the founders of aquience both of whom have had long and productive careers in the pet and commercial development arena together under the newly formed stirling animal health subsidiary we have already planned a product development pipeline with no less than five products expected to be launched over the next 12 18 months
4764863 the philosophies of the two companies are ideally suited to this venture both are focused on developing high value solutions to the pressing problems of pet ownership in the modern world not only have we identified the root cause of a number of major concerns but we are also developing novel solutions to satisfy both the needs and wants of the owner and pet alike
4764864 since announcing the formation of sah and the term sheet with aquience we have had several legitimate enquiries for distribution agreements in south east asia and even europe we intend to maximise these relationships and together with an increasing presence in north america establish conduits into the global pet market
4764865 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
4764866 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
4764867 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
4764868 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
4764869 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
4764870 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
4764871 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
4764872 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

4764895 science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn ones living at it
4764896 the secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources
4764897 the only thing that interferes with my learning is my education
4764898 god does not care about our mathematical difficulties he integrates empirically
4764899 the whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking
4764900 technological progress is like an axe in the hands of a pathological criminal
4764901 peace cannot be kept by force it can only be achieved by understanding
4764902 the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible
4764903 we cant solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
4764904 education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school
4764905 the important thing is not to stop questioning curiosity has its own reason for existing
4764906 do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics i can assure you mine are still greater
4764907 equations are more important to me because politics is for the present but an equation is something for eternity
4764908 if a is a success in life then a equals x plus y plus z work is x y is play and z is keeping your mouth shut
4764909 two things are infinite the universe and human stupidity and im not sure about the the universe
4764910 as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality
4764911 whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of truth and knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods
4764912 i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones
4764913 in order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must above all be a sheep
4764914 the fear of death is the most unjustified of all fears for theres no risk of accident for someone whos dead
4764915 too many of us look upon americans as dollar chasers this is a cruel libel even if it is reiterated thoughtlessly by the americans themselves
4764916 heroism on command senseless violence and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism how passionately i hate them
4764917 no this trick wont work how on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love
4764918 my religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind
4764919 yes we have to divide up our time like that between our politics and our equations but to me our equations are far more important for politics are only a matter of present concern a mathematical equation stands forever
4764920 the release of atom power has changed everything except our way of thinking the solution to this problem lies in the heart of mankind if only i had known i should have become a watchmaker
4764921 great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities the latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence
4764922 the most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious it is the source of all true art and all science he to whom this emotion is a stranger who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe is as good as dead his eyes are closed
4764923 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary man would indeeded be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death
4764924 the further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life and the fear of death and blind faith but through striving after rational knowledge
4764925 now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me that means nothing people like us who believe in physics know that the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion
4764926 you see wire telegraph is a kind of a very very long cat you pull his tail in new york and his head is meowing in los angeles do you understand this and radio operates exactly the same way you send signals here they receive them there the only difference is that there is no cat
4764927 one had to cram all this stuff into ones mind for the examinations whether one liked it or not this coercion had such a deterring effect on me that after i had passed the final examination i found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year
4764928 one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness from the fetters of ones own ever shifting desires a finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought
4764929 he who joyfully marches to music rank and file has already earned my contempt he has been given a large brain by mistake since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice this disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once heroism at command how violently i hate all this how despicable and ignoble war is i would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action it is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder
4764930 a human being is a part of a whole called by us universe a part limited in time and space he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness this delusion is a kind of prison for us restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty
4764931 not everything that counts can be counted and not everything that can be counted counts

4764936 saya dan ahli majlis lain didakwa tidak ambil kira sensitiviti mengenai politik semasa
4764937 dalam mesyuarat itu sebulat suara bahawa pas setuju menyarankan supaya tiga pemimpin presiden timbalan presiden dan setiausaha agung mencari jalan untuk memperkasakan islam untuk perpaduan ummah

4764962 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4764963 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4764964 i was in high school when she hit it big
4764965 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4764966 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4764967 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4764968 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4764969 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4764970 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4764971 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4764972 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4764973 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4764974 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4764975 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4764976 carbon dioxide they call it pollution we call it life
4764977 shes lead vocalist of my favourite all time irish group the cranberries
4764978 the scope of these recalls is intentionally large to prevent any injuries from occurring
4764979 working extremely hard to address your concerns and continue creating safe entertaining toys for you and your children
4764980 if an animal is used to spectators on the other side of the barricade and someone has their leg dangling over that could be a problem
4764981 they could be provoked by anything out of the ordinary
4764982 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
4764983 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
4764984 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
4764985 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
4764986 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
4764987 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
4764988 the most important is health care we need that and they want to take it away
4764989 mariam you arrived late today again and this is getting too much selma is not here and nermine is not here youve got to be here on time
4764990 then i ket running and there were trees i got a blister etc

4764992 new york cannot wait any longer for the administration to take action on the dangerous tce contamination across our state a growing number of communities are facing the serious health risks caused by exposure to tce including cancer damage to the nervous and immune systems and developmental problems in children and yet despite these dangers the bush epa delays and delays my legislation will force the administration to finally take steps to address this pressing issue i welcome the committees bi partisan approval of this important measure and urge the senate to pass it promptly
4764993 the evidence on carcinogenic risk and other health hazards from exposure to trichloroethylene has strengthened since 2001
4764994 the committee recommends that federal agencies finalize their risk assessment with currently available data so that risk management decisions can be made expeditiously
4764995 this is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for
4764996 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4764997 t his is the moment as nancy pelosi noted that the world is waiting for
4764998 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4764999 but it should be clinton if it is returning to its best traditions
4765000 cults are not just groups of crazies who follow weird leaders at least the way i use the term they are organizations with a set of common features
4765001 a cult forms around a charismatic individual who promises something this individual professes some special knowledge sometimes the claim is access to ancient secrets sometimes its an entirely new discovery to which he or she alone is privy sometimes its a combination of both the leader offers to share the information with those who follow some leaders offer utopia or a way out just come along follow me ill make the decisions all will be fine
4765002 in a cult its this charismatic leader who eventually becomes the object of devotion in some cases hes actually deified and as that happens the leader comes to hold extraordinary control over the lives of his followers
4765003 cults are totalistic authoritarian the leader is supreme and delegates power to very few the leaders morality becomes the only acceptable theology the only acceptable behavior and as i said veneration is eventually centered on him not on supreme beings or abstract principles
4765004 and often there is a double set of ethics members are urged to be honest and loving to each other but to deceive and shun outsiders emphasis mine established religions tend to follow one set of rules for everybody
4765005 thats another important element thought reform cult leaders use a variety of psychological processes to manipulate their members some leaders are fairly benign but others are not and really exploit the idealism of their followers
4765006 the way i see it there are two broad types of cults both of which use thought reform
4765007 use very intense persuasion techniques these groups keep members by getting them to buy more and more courses
4765008 then there are the cults that recruit followers for life these groups use organized psychological and social persuasion to produce extreme attitudinal changes as a result they come to exert enormous control over the lives of their members they are manipulative deceptive and highly exploitative
4765009 i still dont see why anyone but a nutcase would fall for such crap
4765010 its not just marginal people who get sucked in in some studies approximately two thirds of the respondents come from normal families and were demonstrating age appropriate behavior when they entered a cult
4765011 has your research shed light on why people seek out these movements
4765012 often they dont these groups seek you and as ive said these leaders can be incredibly charming and persuasive
4765013 its seductive to think that youre elite chosen most cults teach their members that only they are enlightened and everyone else in the world is left out lesser in some way its powerful stuff
4765014 der arbeitsmarkt ist in einem deutlich besseren zustand als noch vor wenigen jahren
4765015 weil sich der arbeitsmarkt in den vergangenen zwei jahren so positiv entwickelt hat wird es im n chsten abschwung voraussichtlich erstmals seit jahrzehnten keinen anstieg der so genannten sockelarbeitslosigkeit mehr geben
4765016 dont women who get plastered beyond control have any responsibility for what happens to them
4765017 i want sex and i want to know when i can stop worrying about what that other person wants or doesnt want or hasnt agreed to
4765018 those are words that ring in the american national anthem on american licence plates in the american declaration of independence

4765023 ich habe mich einfach gut gef hlt also habe ich mir den ball geschnappt und den elfmeter geschossen das entwickelt sich bei uns so
4765024 das 2 2 tut weh die mannschaft konnte nicht mehr gut stehen weil ein mann gefehlt hat f r mich ist der abend eine entt uschung der platzverweis ist hart fu ball ist ja wie basketball geworden
4765025 ich verstehe einfach nicht dass wir ein spiel das wir eindeutig bestimmt hatten noch aus der hand gegeben haben
4765026 diese passivit t nach einer f hrung nervt mich immens wir haben den fehler gemacht das 2 0 verwalten zu wollen alle schalten dann einen gang zur ck so etwas rgert mich extrem das ist wie eine selbstgei elung und ich w rde mir auch w nschen dass wir mal ein spiel mit elf mann zu ende bringen
4765027 what the heck is a depth gauge do i need one
4765028 anytime you can take a streak of historical significance and personally be responsible for its conclusion thats a tremendous credit to the individual responsible for bringing the streak to its end
4765029 by and large ive done a tremendous job ending streaks and i know in my heart of hearts that i am more than capable of bringing this one to an end as well
4765030 i made no secret about my ambition to flip that culture in lincoln
4765031 and it took me very little time to do just that to take a 10 win program and flip it to a 5 win program within one years time i think it takes a certain level of competence to achieve such a turnaround unfortunately there were those involved in that particular program who did not have the intellectual capacity to grasp the difficulty of such a milestone
4765032 and im not sure if youve heard of it its called the super bowl and ive coached in it to be particularly candid and blunt i have little interest in coaching a football team in any bowl other than the super bowl and i think my performance has been consistent with that philosophy
4765033 my biggest personal disappointment is that i was not able to end the streak of sellouts at memorial stadium
4765034 the streak is clearly the byproduct of living in an isolated state where intellectual stimulation is difficult to obtain ending that streak would have been a tremendous accomplishment a feather in my cap if you will in terms of changing the atmosphere of that state away from childish football adulation and into a more sophisticated intellectual scenario
4765035 your typical fan or reporter lay people tend to focus more on how certain techniques and alignments appear on the football field to their own naked untrained eye
4765036 but they have little appreciation or regard for how certain zone blocking philosophies appear when diagrammed to perfection on paper
4765037 there are no conditions obviously what is missing is that the waiver is void if there is another atomic test
4765038 i think a majority of countries feel that the current draft is very weak and there is no conditionality at all i dont really think that the u s expect that they are able to pass this draft
4765039 some in nsg predict prolonged debate over conditions for indian exemption
4765040 a strategic reserve of nuclear fuel to guard against any disruption of supply
4765041 a response to similar actions by other states which could impact national security
4765042 its really a miracle the mother had taken no stimulants during ovulation
4765043 once you get over the fear its really really enjoyable
4765044 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4765045 there are people who are advising him to avoid confrontation but i dont think he has made up his mind
4765046 it is at the moment that pakistan cannot afford confrontation
4765047 and its obvious that the present government and president musharraf cannot get along so it is in the best interest of pakistan that some way is found whereby this mode of confrontation can be changed or can be more conciliatory
4765048 these unsubstantiated spate of reports are totally baseless and malicious
4765049 these bases have only recently been upgraded to nato standard
4765050 they have been operationally targeted to seriously degrade the georgian military
4765051 there is a presence of our armed forces near gori and senaki we make no secret of it
4765052 they are there to defuse an enormous arsenal of weapons and military hardware which have been discovered in the vicinity of gori and senaki without any guard whatsoever
4765053 there are a few countries that will say told you so
4765054 but many more will want to walk away from the problem and for the next few years georgia will be far too busy trying to pick itself up
4765055 its a big disappointment obviously you know it was one of the goals of the season for me to do well here
4765056 so obviously the quarter finals is not going to do it for me
4765057 i think james played well i can only really say how well he played
4765058 i mean he went full out and hit everything he needed i thought
4765059 im happy for him hes a good guy i hope he can go all the way now
4765060 its also brutal because were playing this tournament in one week it really doesnt make it a whole lot easier to us as players
4765061 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year just losing too many matches which i maybe should have won maybe wimbledon maybe some other matches as well now in north america
4765062 to let the love flow and it will take care of the rest
4765063 a vegans case for ron paul and or a good alternative to abortion being adoption
4765064 i am responsible although i may not be able to prevent the worst from happening i am responsible for my attitude toward the inevitable misfortunes that darken life bad things do happen how i respond to them defines my character and the quality of my life i can choose to sit in perpetual sadness immobilized by the gravity of my loss or i can choose to rise from the pain and treasure the most precious gift i have life itself
4765065 talk to you when i get back im going to chaddys now
4765066 i am here to condemn chinas inhuman actions against peaceful demonstrators in our homeland chinas highhandedness in all three provinces of tibet has left thousands injured and dead since the march unrest
4765067 august 15th is a moment of joy of happiness for indians a nation a race that for the past 50 years have been providing us asylum has given us a second life
4765068 the opportunities both commercial and educational india has provided to the tibetans is highly commendable as no nation would treat refugees as its own citizens tibetans are truly grateful for the love and the affection being showered upon them by indians hence on this special day the tibetan youth congress would like to thank india wholeheartedly for everything that it has done for the tibetans
4765069 everybody who is engaged in these protests knows the risks
4765070 tibetans are living in a state of fear and intimidation
4765071 this is going to be an impossible project the spreadsheet is going to be huge the entire project will take years surely you will forget some scripture references right
4765072 es hora de retar al pp en primer lugar a que pida disculpas por todo lo que dijo de la financiaci n de catalu a prevista en su estatuto de autonom a y en segundo lugar que retire el recurso al estatuto en el tribunal constitucional
4765073 se debe al modelo que pact con el pp cuando gobernaba
4765074 sucede que todav a no hay un acuerdo sobre c mo debe cumplirse esa previsi n del estatuto el gobierno tiene una idea que todav a no es compartida aunque buscamos el m nimo com n denominador posible que haga viable cumplir con las previsiones del estatuto y mejorar la financiaci n de las comunidades aut nomas
4765075 los partidos de catalu a se cuestionaran el apoyo a los presupuestos
4765076 que se aprueben los presupuestos es la garant a de que se puede abordar un nuevo modelo de financiaci n si no hay presupuestos nuevos no habr un nuevo modelo de financiaci n por lo tanto catalu a saldr perdiendo igual que el resto de comunidades aut nomas
4765077 ya que los catalanes no entender an c mo se puede negar el apoyo a unos presupuestos que van a ser mejores para catalu a
4765078 le pido a ciu que arrime el hombro que coopere y que no se radicalice

4765112 as far as im aware there is no association between headaches and the use of compact fluorescent lamps
4765113 this consultation should be of interest to all isle of man residents
4765114 it will help to define government policy in relation to the retail sector which in turn will have a major influence on the future appearance of towns and villages all around the island
4765115 i would urge people to take advantage of this opportunity to have their say in the future of retailing in the isle of man
4765116 many thought provoking recommendations have been produced on how the sector can be taken forward many of them embracing other important initiatives such as those concerning the regeneration of our town centres

4765119 consumers shouldnt have to worry about tracking devices being sewn into the seams of their clothing or pressed into the soles of their shoes
4765120 we are putting apparel and rfid companies on notice that consumers will protest any item level use of rfid on apparel
4765121 consumer awareness and opposition to rfid has grown exponentially since 2003
4765122 any u s company foolish enough to use rfid on apparel will face stiff repercussions
4765123 this is a continuum that started back on 9 11 to reform law enforcement and the intelligence community to focus on the terrorism threat
4765124 it moves what the rules were from 1993 to the new world we live in but it maintains civil liberties

4765126 if properly implemented this should assure the public that people are not being investigated by agencies who are not trained in how to protect constitutional rights
4765127 the fbi will need to be vigilant both in its policies and its practices to live up to that promise
4765128 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information
4765129 it turns police officers into spies on behalf of the federal government
4765130 in the right direction however the vagueness of the provisions giving broad access to criminal intelligence to undefined agencies is very troubling
4765131 but more often concern about his emerging overconfidence which is making it difficult to interact with him
4765132 you get a sense they are concerned that the al maliki regime has an inflated sense of his power
4765133 he is successfully fashioning himself as an iraqi hero who kicked the americans out that makes him difficult to negotiate with
4765134 theres even some evidence that al maliki wants to start a fight with the sons of iraq
4765135 al maliki doesnt believe he has to accommodate these people he will only do it if we twist his arm to the breaking point
4765136 if the negotiations crash and burn i will be forced to pull out all u s troops by jan 1

4765149 but a great book rich in ideas and beauty a book that raises and tries to answer great fundamental questions demands the most active reading of which you are capable
4765150 a democracy for all of its obvious virtues posed the danger of releasing an undisciplined individualism

4765165 for the past two years crude has followed the dollar almost lock step
4765166 the strength weve seen in the dollar is almost certainly helping bring crude down at this point as you move backward it actually acts as a stimulus on the economy
4765167 as for housing starts i think everyone is expecting them to remain soft ppi wont be much of a market mover as commodities have been moving lower which makes last months numbers irrelevant

4765172 yes saudi intelligence chief prince muqrin bin abdul aziz did visit pakistan on friday and met senior government officials
4765173 the main purpose of the visit was to find an amicable solution to the musharraf impeachment issue and that no one should become a laughing stock
4765174 saudi arabia is a very strong ally of both pakistan and the us and the visit was a sincere and friendly effort to interact with all and sundry to settle the issue
4765175 the saudis have very strong bonds of friendship with us president pervez musharraf has also been very close to riyadh during his rule

4765200 the nrcs new reactor licensing process is currently focused on light water reactors and the staff is confident this basic framework can also support an ngnp review
4765201 we will work with doe to supplement that framework with ngnp specific items
4765202 doe is committed to the development and commercial deployment of ngnp technology in a timely manner
4765203 nuclear energy is vital to our nations energy security and the ngnp has the potential to extend the benefits to bring nuclear technology to a whole new sector of the u s economy
4765204 what weve found with miscanthus is that the amount of biomass generated each year would allow us to produce about two and a half times the amount of ethanol we can produce per acre of corn
4765205 it wasnt that we didnt know how to grow switchgrass because the yields we obtained were actually equal to the best yields that had been obtained elsewhere with switchgrass
4765206 one reason why miscanthus yields more biomass than corn is that it produces green leaves about six weeks earlier in the growing season
4765207 one of the criticisms of using any biomass as a biofuel source is it has been claimed that plants are not very efficient about 0 1 percent efficiency of conversion of sunlight into biomass
4765208 what we show here is on average miscanthus is in fact about one percent efficient so about one percent of sunlight ends up as biomass
4765209 keep in mind that when we consider our energy use a few hours of solar energy falling on the earth are equal to all the energy that people use over a whole year so you dont really need that high an efficiency to be able to capture that in plant material and make use of it as a biofuel source
4765210 our highest productivity is actually occurring in the south on the poorest soils in the state
4765211 so that also shows us that this type of crop may be very good for marginal land or land that is not even being used for crop production
4765212 in the context of global climate change thats important because it means that by producing a biofuel on that land youre taking carbon out of the atmosphere and putting it into the soil
4765213 keep in mind that this miscanthus is completely unimproved so if we were to do the sorts of things that weve managed to do with corn where weve increased its yield threefold over the last 50 years then its not unreal to think that we could use even less than 10 percent of the available agricultural land
4765214 and if you can actually grow it on non cropland that would be even better
4765215 no no youre a serpent and thers no use denying it

4765297 a solution to a given problem is called optimal if one can prove that no better solution exists some skeptics might ask why should intuition rely on a rule of thumb instead of the optimal strategy to solve a problem by optimization rather than by a rule of thumb implies both that an optimal solution exists and that a strategy exists to find it computers would seem to be the ideal tool for finding the best solution to a problem yet paradoxically the advent of high speed computers has opened our eyes to the fact that the best strategy often cannot be found

4765339 if police officers no longer see themselves as engaged in protecting their communities from criminals and instead as domestic intelligence agents working on behalf of the cia they will be encouraged to collect more information

4765345 there will be a time and a place to deal with the consequences and repercussions of russias actions

4765357 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4765358 i was in high school when she hit it big
4765359 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4765360 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4765361 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4765362 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4765363 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4765364 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4765365 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4765366 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4765367 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4765368 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4765369 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself

4765379 were finding that hope is consistently associated with fewer symptoms of depression and the good news is that hope is something that can be taught and can be developed in many of the people who need it
4765380 if you feel you know how to get what you want out of life and you have that desire to make that happen then you have hope
4765381 many of the people who seek therapy are not mentally ill they dont meet criteria for depression or other illnesses
4765382 so if you focus primarily on what is wrong with them there may not be much progress
4765383 hope therapy seeks to build on strengths people have or teach them how to develop those strengths we focus not on what is wrong but on ways to help people live up to their potential
4765384 were finding that people can learn to be more hopeful and that will help them in many ways
4765385 what i think is exciting about hope therapy is the way we are learning from people who are doing very well we have been figuring out what hopeful people are doing right and taking those lessons and developing therapies and interventions for people who are not doing as well
4765386 and the great news is that it seems to work we can teach people how to be more hopeful

4765391 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4765392 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4765393 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4765394 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4765395 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4765399 not only are there more foreclosures the losses are much larger in 2005 fannie lost an average of 7 per cent when it sold a forclosed property so far this year the figure is 26 per cent and in california it is up to 40 per cent in all of 2006 fannie forclosed on 93 homes the current rate is 1000 per month
4765400 it is interesting that the industry has invented new ways to lose money when the old ways seemed to work just fine
4765401 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
4765402 i cannot figure out why the sec and fasb simply refuses to force firms to inform investors what is actually on their books

4765431 downward pressure on the philippine economy is mounting owing to slowing exports of electronics products and accelerating inflation
4765432 in 2009 we expect the pace of inflation to decelerate as rice price fuelled inflationary pressure is expected to ease thereafter the economy should recover gradually in 2009 driven by internal demand
4765433 as far as forex is concerned high crude oil prices continue to put the peso at risk of further depreciation if however crude oil prices trend down toward the end of 2008 in response to a slowing world economy then we see a possibility of the peso stabilizing
4765434 we think the downside impact in the peso should be partly offset by robust remittances from ofws overseas filipino workers and increased exports from the bpo business process outsourcing industry

4765448 the borrowing of last resort to be avoided by all but people in dire financial straits
4765449 the one thing i havent really seen explored in this series has been the reasons why the sudden embracing of debt took place
4765450 the wwii generation has been aarp solid in demanding more and more
4765451 my own view has to do with the aberrant nature of this economic cycle instead of being employment and wage gain driven causing a virtuous cycle of hiring spending and capex and more consumer spending it was backwards unusually dependent upon ultra low interest rates housing and asset appreciation
4765452 the reasons why the sudden embracing of debt took place
4765453 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4765454 the prayers and support have been a source of strength for our family during this difficult time
4765455 we are interested in the american boy and we are trying to get him but that depends on a work permit so it will be a few days before we know about that
4765456 we had asked maurice if he thought there were any players in the american league whom he thought would do well and he recommended two or three players
4765457 the clubs dont own the players over there so the mls are happy to let him go
4765458 we are in the final stages of tying everything up but we still have to apply for the work permit
4765459 he is only 22 and has played the last number of internationals so id hope we will get him all right and hes played in the olympics
4765460 they are on tour in germany but weve had problems getting in touch with them
4765461 we made a bid but weve still not heard back from them weve had a problem communicating with them
4765462 thank god the situation is under control we havent observed any security violations people are happy and cooperating with security forces
4765463 this year we havent seen the pilgrims holding pictures of clerics or shouting against the government like last year
4765464 we come every year last year my son was wounded by a bullet during the pilgrimage but i insisted on coming again anyway this year the situation is more secure and organized
4765465 the future of these cells and their resistance action depends on the american decision either to implement a withdrawal timetable or to establish long term bases
4765466 when i first went out on the field i was thinking about when my grandmother raised me and how i talked to her about making it in the nfl
4765467 i thought about it while we were warming up like i finally made it through all the stuff that ive been through ive actually made it
4765468 even though i didnt get drafted im getting just as much opportunity as anyone else thats pretty much all they can do for me is give me an opportunity its all about what i do with it
4765469 every day were together we play video games we hang out and sometimes we go to the mall were like brothers
4765470 every day is like an interview when i play im trying to build my resume in this business
4765471 im just scraping from the bottom of the barrel i take it one play at a time and a day at a time and im still figuring out what works
4765472 my biggest thing is every time i step on the field i want to play well and be consistent
4765473 were really excited to have a fresh look for the gold rush on the field i think this uniform is going to be the best one weve ever had
4765474 we gave them an intricate design and it sets them apart
4765475 erin wanted to bring back the suede and mold the look from back then to a current look
4765476 we put a lot of things together for this design i was trying to accomplish something that maintained their identity and carried over so they didnt lose their entire image with the switch
4765477 they were very excited to see them and they all screamed when we unveiled it to them
4765478 its all about scoring points on offense and we didnt get that accomplished last week
4765479 this week against green bay we want to move the ball and score points
4765480 we want to make plays pretty much execute every play coach gives us
4765481 blocking well running the right routes catching every ball and having the quarterback throwing the ball well
4765482 for the most part we really want to play as one eliminate all the mental mistakes and small errors that we make on the field
4765483 its going to be a pretty good game the first group is going to be playing a lot more than we did in the first game playing against green bay is a good challenge for the secondary because they are a team that likes to throw the ball a lot they have a history of getting the ball down the field
4765484 they have four receivers in the game at one time and three receivers in the game on early downs which are normally running downs they are a pass oriented offense were expecting them to come out with a lot of passes
4765485 our run game wasnt up to par like we normally do
4765486 the more you communicate its almost like checks and balances if youre speaking to one of your teammates and youre telling him what to do even if youre wrong they can turn around and tell you what to do
4765487 that just goes to show how much communication helps if you say the wrong thing at least somebody is hearing what youre thinking and they can correct you its definitely something that the second team needs to do
4765488 ive been working hard to correct everything i did wrong in that game there were some positives but there were also some negatives and i want to correct those i didnt play as aggressive as i needed to play
4765489 its going to be a good opportunity i was looking forward to this the whole week
4765490 i crunched in a lot of the defense and some stuff on the field that im still trying to get sharp at but when we get out there i should be straight
4765491 well we have all of these different flavors of gatorade so we like to see them mix them up for variety
4765492 we dont just want regular gatorade in the water bottles anymore because weve got white gatorade red gatorade blue gatorade g2 gatorade you name it so we want to see them bring their a game when it comes to mixing this stuff up
4765493 in the web affiliate business weve always known that personal referrals and relationships lead to business drink
4765494 its different than most home based operations because at drink act web its free to become a dealer and you dont have to buy thousands of dollars worth of drink inventory we handle all the shipments tracking and support for you for the first time in history fans of an energy drink product can also participate in the actual distribution model and profit from it

4765770 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4765771 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4765772 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4765773 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4765774 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4765775 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4765776 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4765777 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4765778 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4765779 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4765780 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4765781 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4765782 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4765783 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4765784 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4765785 but i also accepted it because for me doesnt matter
4765786 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career
4765787 the solstice coupe represents a major collaboration of design and engineering
4765788 the sleek lines of the new roof give the car a fresh appearance yet only minimal changes were made to the body structure its a great example of building on an already solid foundation
4765789 this means shifts in the nissan gt r take only 0 2 seconds thats formula one fast people

4765791 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4765792 there is no god but allah indian forces go back
4765793 people have given their verdict that they wont tolerate oppression and injustice it is time for new delhi to act and solve the dispute
4765794 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4765795 this is a planning took where all things are going
4765796 a mim me bastaria que um prefeito desse jeito na cidade da bahia

4765798 archuleta was the more impressive of the two davids in idols live concert
4765799 there is no indication of any change in the near future regarding the current state of competition market forces have not yet met the challenge of controlling price increases
4765800 the marketplace changes and you have to change your offerings
4765801 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4765802 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4765803 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4765804 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4765805 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4765806 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4765807 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4765808 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4765809 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4765810 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4765811 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4765812 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4765813 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4765814 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4765815 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4765816 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4765817 i was upset to lose this game i had a good start and tried to save some energy in the first half but found it too late to catch up others later on
4765818 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4765819 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4765820 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4765821 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4765822 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4765823 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4765824 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4765825 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4765826 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4765827 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4765828 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4765829 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4765830 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4765831 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4765832 and they went out and preached that men should repent and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them
4765833 the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel
4765834 and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
4765835 and they went out and preached that men should repent
4765836 where did the evolutionary ancestor of all life today come from
4765837 evolution comprises all the stages of development of the universe the cosmic biological and human or cultural developments attempts to restrict the concept of evolution to biology are gratuitous life is a product of the evolution of inorganic matter and man is a product of the evolution of life
4765838 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4765839 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4765840 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4765841 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4765842 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4765843 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4765844 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4765845 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4765846 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4765847 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4765848 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4765849 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4765850 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4765851 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4765852 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4765853 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4765854 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4765855 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4765856 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4765857 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4765858 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4765859 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4765860 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4765861 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4765862 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4765863 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4765864 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4765865 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4765866 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4765867 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4765868 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4765869 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4765870 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4765871 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4765872 take the poetry of our hearts and turn it into prose
4765873 thats why were going as if jarod is going to be the quarterback against towson
4765874 if kaipo comes back that will be great but were not going to push that if you start pushing hamstrings a guy can miss the whole season if you come back too quick
4765875 navys starting qb say his name 10 times fast questionable for opener
4765876 hes a great guy to take the time to help a younger guy but im going to have to pick it up on my own now
4765877 we wish him a great recovery and weve got to move on its the whole defensive lines responsibility to help in those situations that hollis has left open from his injury but i dont feel any pressure personally
4765878 with the new guy obviously hes got a whole different level of athleticism thats going to help him get a lot more involved in rushing the passer and making plays on the ball so a lot of that remains to be seen
4765879 we have high expectations for him but once you get into games and see how he performs the jurys still out
4765880 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4765881 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4765882 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4765883 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4765884 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4765885 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4765886 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4765887 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4765888 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4765889 derrick has great hands that allows us to game plan a little bit differently
4765890 ive got a great feel for the game experience helped me out a lot because i know what to expect more im lowering my shoulder a little bit more running lower and just trying to get better as a running back
4765891 in those types of situations you need a low runner that is going to get the ball up field for us
4765892 thats one thing that im definitely not going to live with with myself but im not going to make a big commotion out of it
4765893 i think it will speak for itself and it is speaking so were going to see how that goes from there
4765894 if im on the field long enough something is going to happen for me thats a proven fact
4765895 more good than bad but it aint going to be always good
4765896 kick return punt return interceptions theres just a certain feeling you get with the ball in your hands especially when youre on defense and you dont get it that much
4765897 i did school and football for five years i can do all football now
4765898 you have to make plays on special teams thats probably the most important
4765899 when we have the backfield like we have you know westbrook is going to play so you have to make the team in other ways
4765900 offensive coordinator marty morhninweg and andy reid have a lot of confidence in me and i just feel like ive been given a good opportunity to help his team
4765901 a couple of drops in there that we need to make sure we take care of
4765902 he banged up his leg and fell on his knee but he bounced back which was a good thing
4765903 he was a little sore but he pulled himself back and worked through it and it worked out for him he didnt make the injury list i thought he caught the ball ok
4765904 if a rookie can have dibs on getting into the hot tub at the end of a night after a preseason game he gets the first choice
4765905 he can play everything he got a lot of cushion today so we were just popping little hitches in front of him hes got a ways to go being a rookie but the things hes gotten down right now are well ahead of others
4765906 he normally was away from the area where he had to block we have to keep working on that
4765907 good run by hunt and hunt is into the open field inside the 10 gets a block from desean jackson who is doing it all
4765908 he comes out of breaks very quick he has a real nice step back once he catches the ball hes able to make the first guy miss if hes able to turn around he definitely has some speed
4765909 with the weather conditions and trying to make a move i was trying to stiff arm a guy and got the ball out a little bit
4765910 its just a letter on why i feel i should be reinstated its my chance to respond and well see how it goes
4765911 so i think it the letter is real important in terms of influencing the commissioners decision
4765912 no not at all i was an a student well know something soon
4765913 ah nu mai lasi odata in pace ce treaba mai am eu cu tine de ce naiba ne om fi intalnit vreau sa te uit
4765914 i dont care whos in there whether its the third teamers or the rookies i just want to see the true grit of our football team come out as we move forward
4765915 when you lose a guy like ray rice who did so much for your program its hard
4765916 its not coincidental that things really took off during his time here now he certainly had a great supporting cast and ray would be the first one to tell you that but rays a phenomenal football player and a great teammate to have and were going to miss him
4765917 kordell mason jourdan and freshman joe martinek have looked really impressive so far
4765918 thats spring time and now do we have a ray rice no we dont but we have other guys and theyre going to do their best and i think their best is going to be pretty good
4765919 we cant live up to what ray rice did we just want to make names for ourselves
4765920 even when i was behind ray last year i was always of the mind set that i wanted to play and that i had the ability to do it at this level
4765921 but i think a very close second is his patience he understands when to jet it and when to wait
4765922 i feel bad for him because hes such a great kid
4765923 hes been here for the whole time with us and was in our first recruiting class a lot of them werent ready to play as freshmen but we had to play then and thank god we did because now were going to have him back for another year
4765924 we basically considered all three of us as starters with more than likely sirod and dave lindquist the starters
4765925 they told me after spring that they wanted me to try out at the
4765926 2008 washington state cougars preview can the cougars hunt down a postseason berth in 2008
4765927 verder wordt internet in de kunstensector vooral ingezet als informatiemedium

4765929 to suggest that arthur erickson is deliberately misrepresenting himself as an architect is like suggesting that einstein was not a physicist in his later years arthur erickson has been an architect for 50 years and he cannot help it if people continue to call him one regardless of the aibcs opinion on the matter
4765930 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4765931 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4765932 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4765933 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4765934 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4765935 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4765936 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4765937 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4765938 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4765939 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4765940 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4765941 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4765942 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4765943 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4765944 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4765945 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4765946 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4765947 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4765948 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4765949 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4765950 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4765951 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4765952 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4765953 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4765954 because the current states were being chopped up beyond recognition part of his plan included renaming the new states by referencing natural geologic features or the regions cultural history
4765955 its always been a goal of mine and in the back of my head i thought i could do it but to actually do it is amazing
4765956 with 200 to go we just had a sniff that we would have a chance and it was probably pretty ugly at that stage and just a question of just digging deep
4765957 i couldnt play silly beggars and go chasing world records ill be 31 in london coming to my prime ill definitely be in london but i might concentrate on the team or madison and make sure i get a gold
4765958 i think that michael can be called the best olympian of all time not because he has more gold medals than anybody but in the way hes handled himself and in the way hes actually won under a tremendous amount of pressure
4765959 as soon as i took the last half stroke to be honest i thought i had lost the race
4765960 and that was the difference because if i would have glided then i would have come up short ive been lucky enough over the last four years to have two pretty good finishes in olympic finals i guess im blessed
4765961 but apparently we need to have them widened youd think someone would have mentioned
4765962 and some fortune cookie authors dont even have ideas and need to rip off

4765980 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4765981 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4765982 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4765983 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4765984 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4765985 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4765986 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4765987 i cant do that i cannot bear for men to look at me undressed
4765988 its okay i am a doctor ill tell you what i will turn off the light and use a torch will that make you feel better
4765989 we are going to have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4765990 i think chelsea have improved they have signed some good players they have got a new manager and they will be very hungry
4765991 they have got great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row so its going to be very tough this season
4765992 it will be interesting to see how arsenal do with some of the players they have lost i think it could be a tough season but somehow arsene wenger seems to do the business with his young players

4766023 l die antwort auf die erste frage habe ich d und die w re slide 10 eigentlich ist sie kurz und einfach sie wird deinem leben zwar nein nein ich denke daraus l sst sich ein ganzes kapitel keinen sinn geben aber du wei t dann wenigstens womit du machen rechnen musst drei sachen sind im leben wirklich wichtig sie l nehmen wir stattdessen krieg wenn irgendein riesenkerl dir den sind die antriebsfaktoren f r alles in deinem leben f r alles was weg zum wasserloch versperrt geht es offensichtlich erst mal du oder ein anderes lebewesen tust das erste motiv ist das ums berleben als n chstes musst du mit dem typen um eine berleben das zweite die gesellschaftsordnung und das dritte frau k mpfen und dann wird krieg zu einer frage der vergn gen und unterhaltung alles im leben geschieht in dieser gesellschaftsordnung so war es schon lange vor dem mittelalter reihenfolge und nach dem vergn gen kommt nichts anderes krieg als mittel eine gesellschaftsordnung herzustellen mehr das hei t gewisserma en der sinn des lebens besteht genau und auch ein mittel sich selbst als teil der gesell darin diese dritte stufe zu erreichen sobald du die dritte stufe schaftsordnung zu etablieren niemand interessiert sich f r die erreicht hast hast dus geschafft aber erst musst du die anderen gesellschaftsordnung an sich was uns interessiert ist unser stufen durchlaufen l eigener platz in dieser ordnung menschen leben in das musst du mir mal genauer erkl ren rangordnungen wie h hner in hackordnungen da gibt es keinen gro en unterschied patricia papi k nnen wir anhalten und ein schokoladeneis kaufen ich und jetzt ist krieg zur unterhaltung da w rde jetzt gern ein schokoladeneis essen ja genau t nein schatz du musst noch warten du darfst ein eis vielleicht f r leute die ihn sich im fernsehen anschauen haben wenn wir anhalten um aufs klo zu gehen f r die mag krieg ja unterhaltsam sein computerspiele kriegsspiele cnn die ausl ser eines krieges l ich werde dir ein paar beispiele nennen damit die sache kla k nnen oft unterhaltsam sein aber es ist auch unterhaltsam sich rer wird nehmen wir sex das ist am nahe liegendsten sex k mpfe und schlachten anzuschauen und der grund f r sex ist diente erst mal dem berleben aber dann wurde etwas oft unterhaltsam klar die berlebensfrage ist immer noch ein gesellschaftliches daraus deshalb heiratet man und dann punkt vor allem wenn man katholisch ist stimmts aber selbst wird er zum vergn gen wenn du katholisch bist denkst du vermutlich manchmal auch an p dann muss ich jetzt aufs klo den vergn glichen teil es muss also nicht reinweg ums inwiefern zum vergn gen vergn gen gehen bei allem was wir tun kann teilweise das ok ich rede mit der falschen person vielleicht sollte ich lie berleben eine rolle spielen teilweise die gesellschaftsordnung ber und der rest sind vergn gen und unterhaltung okay schau dir nein bleib beim thema doch mal die technik an die technik sollte zun chst einmal das d es gibt da auch noch eine andere ebene berleben erleichtern und berleben bedeutet nicht nur zu ber l leben sondern besser zu berleben und dann hast du d zu sich selbst oh ein vergn gen es zu tun nicht ein vergn gen pl tzlich eine windm hle die wasser aus dem brunnen dabei zuzusehen okay ich habs verstanden zieht l eine andere ebene wenn du die illusion von sex in einem oder feuer biologischen sinn betrachtest wie entstand sex berhaupt aus berlebensgr nden zuerst ging es nicht ums vergn gen nur darum sich zu vereinigen okay lassen wir das gerede ber sex d 2 3 slide 11 l genau bei all diesen dingen geht es immer noch ums ber lich betrachten ehrlich gesagt wenn du einen computer hast leben die gesellschaftsordnung und der unterhaltungfaktor hast du dir dein essen und dergleichen schon gekauft der zweite spielen noch keine rolle ist die gesellschaftsordnung und die gesellschaftliche seite ist f r d und wie hat die technik es dann geschafft zu einer frage der freaks die in ihren minib ros sitzen mit sicherheit ein gesellschaftsordnung zu werden motivationsanreiz l na ja ein gro teil der industrialisierung hatte nur damit zu d du hast bei der comdex etwas wirklich tiefgr ndiges gesagt tun zu berleben oder besser zu berleben also zum bei etwas in der richtung die entwicklung von linux sei ein spiel schnellere und sch nere autos zu bauen aber reden wir globaler mannschaftssport hey mann das ist dein werk mal ber technik in einem gesellschaftlichen sinn hier linux ist ein fabelhaftes beispiel warum leute so begeistert von l mannschaftssportarten sind und darauf brennen teil eines kommt das telefon ins spiel und bis zu einem gewissen grad auch das fernsehen viele der ersten fernsehsendungen teams zu sein dienten im grunde der indoktrination beim radio war es yeah wenn du den ganzen tag vorm computer sitzt brauchst genauso deshalb investierten l nder oft als erstes in den d du vermutlich das gef hl teil von etwas zu sein egal was rundfunk wegen seiner gesellschaftspolitischen seite es hat etwas mit sozialen kontakten zu tun wie jeder andere mannschaftssport denk blo an die spieler einer football um eine gesellschaftsordnung aufzubauen und aufrechtzuer l mannschaft besonders in der high school der gesellschaftliche halten aspekt von linux ist wirklich unglaublich wichtig aber linux ist l genau aber irgendwann wurde mehr daraus heute sehen wir auch unterhaltung und zwar die art von unterhaltung die du mit vor allem zum vergn gen fern das ist offensichtlich geld nur sehr schwer kaufen kannst geld ist ein m chtiger und mittlerweile bist du berall von mobiltelefonen umgeben motivationsanreiz wenn du dich auf der stufe des blo en das ist ein gesellschaftliches ph nomen aber auch der berlebens befindest weil berleben sich einfach kaufen l sst unterhaltungsfaktor spielt zunehmend eine rolle das meiste was du daf r brauchst bekommst du bequem im wo liegt dann also die zukunft der technik mittlerweile haben supermarkt aber wenn du auf der stufe der unterhaltung wir die stufe des berlebens hinter uns gelassen und befinden uns angelangt bist ist geld pl tzlich du meinst dann ist geld auf der gesellschaftlichen stufe richtig nutzlos richtig bisher leistete die technik nichts anderes als uns das nein nicht nutzlos denn du kannst dir damit nat rlich filme leben zu erleichtern es ging immer nur darum schneller zu schnelle autos oder urlaube kaufen du kannst eine menge reisen billiger zu produzieren besser zu wohnen was auch dinge kaufen die dein leben bereichern linus wir m ssen immer was ist jetzt an der informationstechnologie so anders daniela wickeln und patricia muss aufs klo und ich habe lust was kommt nach der tatsache dass jeder am netz auf einen cappuccino denkst du wir finden hier irgendwo einen h ngt was bleibt noch zu tun klar die verbindungen k nnen starbucks wo sind wir denn berhaupt noch besser werden aber das ist nichts grunds tzlich neues wohin f hrt uns also die technik meiner meinung nach ist der n chste gro e schritt die unterhaltung d alles wird irgendwann zum vergn gen d schaut hoch dem geruch nach zu schlie en m ssen wir in der l aber das erkl rt bis zu einem gewissen grad auch den erfolg von n he von king city sein linux denk an die drei antriebsfaktoren der erste ist das l heute spielt sich das ganze in einer anderen gr enordnung berleben das leute mit computern als selbstverst nd ab es betrifft nicht nur einzelne menschen sondern 4 s slide 12 das leben an sich es ist wie das gesetz der entropie in diesem du wei t dass du ein teil der gesellschaft bist du wei t dass entropiegesetz des lebens bewegt sich alles weg vom berleben die gesellschaft sich in diese richtung bewegt und dabei kannst hin zur unterhaltung das schlie t jedoch lokale r ckschritte wie du ihr behilflich sein wir sie st ndig erleben nicht aus manchmal laufen die dinge t h lt sich die nase zu es riecht schrecklich hier einfach aus dem ruder l all das l uft also darauf hinaus dass wir letztlich alle hier sind d aber als system bewegt sich alles in die gleiche richtung um spa zu haben eigentlich k nnten wir uns einfach alles bewegt sich in die gleiche richtung aber nicht zur gleichen entspannt zur cklehnen und die fahrt genie en zeit sex hat das unterhaltungsstadium erreicht krieg steht kurz d just for fun einfach so zum spa davor technik hat es im prinzip geschafft neue sachen dienen zuerst einmal nur dem berleben zum beispiel die raumfahrt sie wird irgendwann eine berlebensfrage sein danach zu einer frage der gesellschaftsordnung werden und schlie lich der unterhaltung dienen oder schau dir den kult um die kultur an ich meine auch hier haben wir wieder das gleiche muster kultur und zivilisation dienten zun chst dem berleben menschen tun sich zusammen um besser berleben zu k nnen und bauen ihre gesellschaftsstruktur auf dann irgendwann existiert kultur aus schlie lich um der unterhaltung willen okay gut nicht ausschlie lich und sie braucht deswegen keine schlechte un terhaltung zu sein es ist bekannt dass die griechen eine sehr starke gesellschaftsordnung hatten und sich dabei bestens unterhielten sie hatten die besten philosophen ihrer zeit okay wie h ngt das alles mit dem sinn des lebens zusammen tut es eigentlich nicht es bedeutet nur dass das ist irgendwie noch ein problem das ist das kleine fehlende glied in der kette ber das du noch nachdenken musst mama sieh mal da sind k he also wenn du wei t dass es im leben auf diese art der wei terentwicklung ankommt dann ist es offensichtlich dein ziel im leben diese weiterentwicklung zu vollziehen und die weiterentwicklung ist nicht nur eine einzelne weiterentwicklung alles was du tust ist ein teil vieler verschiedener wei terentwicklungen die frage k nnte genauso gut hei en was kann ich tun um die gesellschaft besser zu machen

4766028 sagt sie mit zehn entschied sara sich daf r zu ihrem vater zu ziehen der mittlerweile in der nachbarstadt espoo lebte statt weiter bei ihrer mutter und linus zu wohnen es war nicht so dass ich nicht bei mama leben wollte es war nur so dass ich nicht mit linus leben wollte auf diese weise konnten wir uns nur am wochenende streiten wir stritten uns st ndig erst sara torvalds ist mit dem zug aus der kleinen stadt westlich von helsinki als wir lter wurden legte sich das allm hlich
4766029 denke gedanken die andere leute gedacht haben und dann ordne ich sie neu an aber sara sie denkt gedanken die es nie vorher gegeben hat es ist offensichtlich dass sowohl mutter als auch tochter dem medi enrummel gelassen begegnen einen tag vor unserem treffen hatte transmeta ffentlich bekanntgegeben was es da eigentlich auskochte und vielleicht sehen sie an diesen erinnerungen dass ich noch immer nicht w hrend unseres mittagessens fragt mikke sara stand heute etwas ber glaube linus habe eine au ergew hnliche begabung f r computer du wei t schon wer und du wei schon was in der zeitung

version 1 2 im m rz 1995 freigaben war der kernel auf hatte aber als ich es auf die marin seite geschafft hatte hatte ich jedes 250000 zeilen code angewachsen die neue zeitschrift linux journal interesse daran verloren noch weiter zu gehen ich h tte es mir nie tr umen konnte auf 10000 leser verweisen und linux war auf intel lassen dass ich sechs jahre sp ter fast auf den tag genau auf dem kamm digital und sun sparc prozessoren lauff hig das war ein dieser windigen headlands sitzen ber den pazifik die san francisco bay riesenschritt die br cke den nebel und san francisco selbst hinausblicken und meine gedanken auf davids kassettenrekorder sprechen w rde es dauerte nur ein jahr bis ich wieder in die usa flog ich kam zur ck um einen vortrag bei der decus zu halten der usergroup von digital in new orleans dieses mal kam tove mit bei dem treffen waren nur vierzig leute anwesend deshalb hielt sich meine qual in grenzen das beste daran war dass ich maddog dessen b

r seinen bis auf die brust reichenden bart und seinen absurden sinn f r humor ganz zu schweigen von seiner neigung zu schnarchen bekannt ist leitet linux international eine organisation die sich der unterst tzung von linux und linux anwendern verschrieben hat au erdem ist er der pate meiner tochter patricia ein weiteres verm chtnis dieses treffens in new orleans maddog arrangierte dass digital mir einen alpha zur verf gung stellte auf diese weise wurde linux auf etwas anderes als einen pc portiert zwar hatten leute schon vorher linux auf andere architekturen portiert es gab eine portierung auf die 68k familie jene motorola prozessoren die in den ataris und amigas eingebaut waren aber in diesen f llen lief linux nicht gleichzeitig auf beiden plattformen stattdessen mussten teile die auf der neuen plattform nicht funktionierten rausgeworfen und neue teile dazugeschrieben werden deshalb war die erste echte linux portierung die auf den alpha im prinzip lief sowohl auf dem pc als auch dem alpha der gleiche quellcode zu diesem zweck wird eine abstraktionsebene eingef gt so dass der gleiche code auf zwei verschiedene arten kompiliert wird um auf zwei verschiedenen architekturen laufen zu k nnen der code bleibt der gleiche kann aber auf verschiedenen architekturen genutzt werden 142 143 slide 80 somit waren wir mit einer kleinen krise konfrontiert wir waren hacker niemand

vom lehrassistenten zum einmal genug geld uns einen anwalt zu nehmen keine der forschungsassistenten bef rdert und das bedeutet mehr geld und linux firmen wollte gern die geforderte summe in h he von

4766050 i would rather regret the things that i have done than the things that i have not
4766051 ive been thinking a lot lately about taking chances and how its really just about overcoming your fears because the truth is every time you take a big risk in your life no matter how it ends up youre always glad you took it
4766052 life comes with no guarantees no time outs no second chances you just have to live life to the fullest
4766053 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4766054 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4766055 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4766056 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4766057 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4766058 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4766059 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4766060 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4766061 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4766062 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4766063 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4766064 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4766065 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4766066 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4766067 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4766068 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4766069 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4766070 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more

4766074 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4766075 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4766076 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4766077 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4766126 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
4766127 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
4766128 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
4766129 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
4766130 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it

4766135 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
4766136 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing

4766138 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money

4766140 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
4766141 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
4766142 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
4766143 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life

4766156 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
4766157 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
4766158 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all

4766200 it indicates that early eating patterns have effects that persist over time regardless of later changes in diet so it is very important for children to eat a well balanced diet from an early age if they are to get the best out of their education
4766201 councils are increasingly having to consider taking action where parents are putting childrens health in real danger
4766202 as the obesity epidemic grows these tricky cases will keep on cropping up councils would step in to deal with an undernourished and neglected child so should a case with a morbidly obese child be different if parents consistently place their children at risk through bad diet and lack of exercise is it right that a council should step in to keep the childs health under review
4766203 the nations expanding waistline threatens to have a devastating impact on our public services its a huge issue for public health but it also risks placing an unprecedented amount of pressure on council services
4766204 but in the worst cases the children would need to be put on at risk registers or taken into care
4766205 even then the care proceedings may well have been instigated because of related problems rather than exclusively because of their weight
4766206 can have very serious consequences for a childs health and the parental behaviour that leads to childhood obesity can be a form of neglect
4766207 children who are dangerously overweight should be brought into hospital where they can be given 24 hour care for several weeks or months but their parents should have access to them
4766208 it would be better to help the parents provide better nutrition for their child rather than break up the family

4766314 vi kommer til at se p afgifter det er selvsagt men det skal ikke alene v re afgifter vi er n dt til at t nke det samme med forbedret milj teknik som for eksempel elektronisk ukrudtsbek mpelse og endelig skal vi se p om vi opg r milj belastningen rigtigt med den nuv rende metode
4766315 landbruget skal levere det og ikke bare finde p alle mulige d rlige undskyldninger s det her skal have konsekvenser det er slut med de frivillige aftaler n r landbruget ikke overholder dem og jeg kan da godt have nogle landm nd mist nkt for at spekulere i at de ikke blev straffede n r det ikke havde konsekvenser det er jo lidt ligesom hvis det bare var en hensigtserkl ring at man kun m tte k re 110 kilometer p motorvejen
4766316 det er helt uacceptabelt at landbrugets forbrug af spr jtegifte er stadigt stigende der skal andre helt h ndfaste virkemidler i brug som kunne v re kvoter pesticidafgifter eller noget helt tredje socialdemokraterne er bne over for forskellige virkemidler det nytter ikke noget at lave m lemetoden om og sl kke p m leb ndet fordi landbruget ikke lever op til m ls tningerne det fjerner ikke problemet men tilsl rer det
4766317 ansvaret er politikernes der for l ngst skulle have lovgivet p omr det og derved nedbragt forbruget af pesticider i landbruget den vrige industri er jo reguleret med faste krav for udledning af forurenende stoffer her ville det v re ut nkeligt med frivillige aftaler
4766318 vi f ler at den indikator man bruger i jeblikket kun ser p forbruget og m ngden af det som bliver bragt ud man ser ikke p hvad den reelle milj belastning er af de midler som bliver brugt i virkeligheden f ler vi at pesticidhandlingsplanen p en r kke punkter har v ret en succes da vi har f et reduceret antallet af de s kaldte aktivstoffer meget betydeligt og med den restriktive godkendelse vi har i danmark har vi jo f et fjernet alle de midler der kunne v re en trussel for drikkevandskvaliteten
4766319 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4766320 i am not thinking of leaving my commitment with the club the fans and the players is so big that just because i can be disappointed about different things i wont stop trying my best to achieve all of the targets that we have established as a team
4766321 my family and myself are very thankful to the club the fans and the city and we will never give up fighting to get the best for liverpool
4766322 the word for those round things pitchers throw and batters hit or the spaces between two fielders that those round things go thru how crazy
4766323 last friday we received 68 pieces of such rifles from ahmedabad but with abhinav winning gold we have already sold 65 we anticipate a huge interest in the sport in 2007 we sold close to 1 000 rifles this year till july 31 we sold 400 but in the four months from now we are looking at about 2 000
4766324 the phones havent stopped ringing right from dealers to individual buyers the queries are piling up dealers are calling up from punjab haryana himachal pradesh and are demanding rifles in a big way now we have placed bulk orders with an ahmedabad based manufacturing unit to supply us more rifles
4766325 in one day we have sold 10 rifles and received 15 queries it is amazing that even five year old kids accompanied by their parents of course are talking about shooting sale has increased tenfold for us and we have just asked for another 50 air rifles from a kolkata manufacturer

4766330 david cameron is right to criticise russia but wrong to promise georgia early nato membership
4766331 it is simply not credible for britain and nato to make confetti commitments to protect every nation with the lives of our servicemen and women
4766332 when david cameron matches his tough talk on expanding nato more quickly with a pledge to double defence spending or introduce military conscription perhaps then we could take him seriously
4766333 our manpower is allowing us to monitor and handle situations we havent been able to before
4766334 were really looking at anything or everything that could be wrong between the ports of entry
4766335 things have improved here but theyre still talking about closing those streets we just think its unnecessary
4766336 everybody here realizes that the world changed after 9 11
4766337 but all were asking is that a little common sense be used its not black and white
4766338 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4766339 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4766340 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4766341 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot

4766349 while the europeans have been trying to figure out how to proceed the russians have been cutting deals
4766350 gazproms monopoly seeking activities cannot be explained by economic motives alone
4766351 clearly gazprom has sacrificed profits and needed domestic infrastructure investments to achieve foreign policy goals the kremlin and gazprom have shut off energy supplies to six different countries during the last several years
4766352 this victory is for hendrawan he was the one who brought me this far i didnt expect this to happen hendrawan did not only teach me badminton he also taught me how to deal with life

4766354 she made a lot of errors especially in the second and third games
4766355 its a pity for me to lose but ive tried my best she was slower to get going in the first game but she played more steadily than me in the third game
4766356 at the beginning of the third game i had the advantage as i was ahead but as the game progressed my opponent caught up with me and i made more errors because my play was hurried and i became nervous

4766388 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people this act is completely unacceptable to the free nations of the world
4766389 and it is essential that america and other free nations ensure that an embattled democracy seeking to stand with us remains sovereign secure and undivided
4766390 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4766391 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4766392 cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes
4766393 there will be a time and a place to deal with what the repercussions of all this is
4766394 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4766395 if koda does not resign today we will withdraw support to his government tomorrow the formal announcement of which will be made after the party meeting on sunday

4766402 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4766403 the head of our state has made it clear that the georgian side appearing in the future as peacekeepers is now after what has happened unacceptable to south ossetia
4766404 the russian president issued an order to the relevant authorities to start the adoption of extra security measures envisaged in the six point plan
4766405 as these security measures are implemented the withdrawal of forces sent to carry out this reinforcement operation will be carried out
4766406 the document signed by the georgian president differs from the one which was agreed
4766407 it totally omits the introductory part saying that these principles are supported by russia and france and calling on all sides to sign them

4766426 o objetivo que t nhamos era alcan ar o m ximo de finais que a gente j tinha alcan ado em 1996 e 2004 que foram cinco ent o o desempenho da nata o superou nossas expectativas porque teve o ouro algo que n s conhec amos a dificuldade de se conseguir
4766427 medalha de ouro coroa um trabalho de 20 anos algum momento tinha que acontecer e gra as a deus aconteceu nos jogos ol mpicos mais fortes de todos os tempos
4766428 foi a primeira medalha de ouro sul americana desses jogos a delega o no geral bateu v rios recordes sul americanos e pessoais
4766429 o foco para 2012 come a agora quem quiser estar em 2012 com resultado tem que estar pensando em 2012 agora
4766430 with some of this sharp price collapse in commodities you would think the market would be up a lot more
4766431 the underlying factor is that credit continues to appear to be very weak
4766432 at the beginning of this year earnings expectations started to drop precipitously and the stock market dropped with them
4766433 those expectations got built into the stock market and to an excess a lot of stocks discounted all of the bad news that was out there
4766434 in der gegenst ndlichen angelegenheit beitrag zur medienmacht krone weder eine intervention noch eine andere versuchte einflussnahme von au en gab
4766435 ausschlie lich die zust ndigen strukturen der orf informationsdirektion im rahmen ihrer inhaltlichen verantwortung
4766436 klar faymanns berater karl anm krammer hat nun auch den orf auf sp linie gebracht und das mit voller r ckendeckung von orf general alexander anm wrabetz
4766437 our strategy is still the same we want to start games fast and get a lead on saturday we did we dominated the first half territorially and possession wise but were losing 2 1 at half time nothing has changed we just need to convert our good play into goals we managed to do that last season after a couple of games where we played really really well and lost the hearts game here and the kilmarnock game where we felt as if we annihilated them and ended up losing 2 1 in the last minute so it happened last season as well we have got to get through this period and get through it quickly and start to get the lead in games and when we get the lead in games i think we are difficult to beat
4766438 we have registered an interest in taking webster from rangers because we heard he might be available and john sutton we heard might want to come north again so we have registered and asked to be kept informed on that one but that is as far as it has gone
4766439 we will have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4766440 the more we win the more other people want to knock us off our perch
4766441 but when you look at barcelona they have gone out and signed some really good players real madrid look good and inter milan will be strong under jose mourinho
4766442 they have great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row
4766443 they have signed some new players as well and got a new manager so they will make it tough for us while i think liverpool will close the gap this season as well
4766444 it will be interesting to see how arsenal go on given the players they have lost
4766445 any other team would struggle given the players they seem to lose on a regular basis but somehow they seem to stay up there
4766446 this could be a tough season for them but somehow arsene wenger always seems to do the business with his players
4766447 the beauty of playing for a club like this is that the players want to improve
4766448 you see paul scholes and ryan giggs leading the way doing extra in the weights room and our training games are sometimes a better standard than premier league games
4766449 you soon find out a draw is a bad result at this club in fact there have even been times when we have won and said afterwards our performance probably was not good enough
4766450 but that pressure to perform also means if we play to our potential we will pretty much beat everyone
4766451 that is what we need to focus on because if we achieve that on a regular basis we have a very good chance of being champions again

4766457 its here because our consumers are wanting it our consumers are asking these questions so we have to go out and find the answers for them
4766458 the cost of damage was simply huge that we cannot afford to rehabilitate the town by ourselves that is why we need financial assistance from our national government
4766459 while we understand that there were other towns and provinces that suffered more damages than our town we also need attention from our national government

4766472 typisch profliga mensen met een dubbele agenda afspraken worden niet nagekomen
4766473 madonna detailed her marriage to guy in a way that a woman usually doesnt discuss her husband with her brother it showed a side of her that made her very human
4766474 but i think that this was so soon in the marriage she was having grave doubts but so was he the separation was initiated by him
4766475 surprisingly theres a lot of good restaurants in this town i dont know if its because were the capital of north dakota but we do seem to have our fair share of good places to eat
4766476 i go to my room and make milk and drink it
4766477 i dont think so dipak i think you want the milk to cut cocaine
4766478 nope you dont remember me do you what do you want to eat do you want one of these
4766479 nope you dont remember all the other times i havent bought drugs from you do you tell the lady what youd like
4766480 amy was in a right state slurring her words and falling all over the place
4766481 it was sad to see a young girl being left to babysit her it should be the other way around
4766482 that was really fun that was really fun thank you
4766483 respondent lazenby has threatened to kill me if i seek custody of the children respondent twisted my ear august 2007 and bruised my arms june 2007 respondent argues and fights with me in front of the children
4766484 throughout 2006 and 2007 i observed and objected to respondent offering our children beer from beer bottles and ice from scotch glasses
4766485 his family hoped his fling with eka happened because he fell off the wagon
4766486 sadly for them he has genuinely fallen head over heels for her hes like a lovesick puppy and cant shake off his teenage like infatuation jos moving to the u s to piece her life back together
4766487 hes always been friendly but as youd expect he has what i call a healthy scepticism about me i think any father would if their daughter got married the way we did
4766488 im terrified of meeting him face to face but thats going to happen soon its all been arranged
4766489 sir bob is nowhere near as well known in the u s as he is in the u k i understand hes a real legend but i dont know much about him
4766490 hed been heckling me when i went to pick up an award shouting duffo up the duffy things like that nice
4766491 when i picked up the award i had to walk past him so i went to say hi and suddenly he had me pinned against the wall i just went white and had to get away
4766492 i just had to leave the building through the back door it was horrible i went home with a heavy heart and an award
4766493 hes only just managing really we took him on a family trip to italy earlier this summer but there were all these babies around which added to the stress he didnt cope well at all
4766494 but he is better than he was and thats all we can hope for we just want him to stay around for as long as humanly possible
4766495 we are thrilled that the judge did not require us to continue to engage in the folly of purchasing a 4 2 million condo at a time when we should be considering other matters
4766496 we believe the court injected a dose of reality into a contested litigation and feel that we have started down the road to resolution
4766497 these wild eyed dudes walked up to me and my girlfriend and one of them whipped out a carpet knife and demanded money
4766498 the georgian south ossetian conflict issue was considered during a meeting of the russian security council and the president informed those attending that he had just signed the plan based on the six principles
4766499 in any of the emerging nations we all understand it is a necessity we need roads but how do we make them safe for the children pedestrians motorcyclists and things like that
4766500 well be at the united nations in march to beg them for help and make them really understand and recognise that this is a major problem and its just going to get worse
4766501 we spend billions of dollars in research to find a vaccine that will cure aids but for road safety we have the vaccine we have the cure so why is it not implemented
4766502 when they build a road in africa they have to build it without planning right where schools are there are kids from five to teenagers out on the roads at about 6 15 in the morning
4766503 i did a rain dance last night and it seems to have worked what better place to be on a rainy august afternoon than in a cinema
4766504 innerhalb der n chsten sechs bis neun monate sollen die afghanischen kr fte die hauptstadt kabul selbst sichern k nnen

4766507 die georgier brauchen eine klare nachricht wie es weiter geht
4766508 das hier ist kein krieg zwischen georgien und s dossetien sondern eine russische invasion in georgien
4766509 tirando su i piedi muoviti salta cos e muoviti e non arrenderti
4766510 preparati al crepuscolo della tua vita appena iniziata preparati a rinunciare a tutto

4766512 teach a nation how to fish feed the nation many lifetimes
4766513 wake up terrence wake up dont do this to yourself
4766514 but then there are those kids always on the border and he was one of those kids every day you were dealing with something
4766515 he would tear off the head of the best running back we had the best receiver we had and it might be his best friend the junior varsity players were scared to death of him
4766516 if koda does not resign today we will withdraw support to his government tomorrow the formal announcement of which will be made after the party meeting on sunday
4766517 every kid dreams of being a gold medalist only one person in the world can actually say they are the current olympic gold medalist im trying to be that one person
4766518 every kid dreams of being a gold medalist only one person in the world can actually say they are the current olympic gold medalist im trying to be that one person
4766519 i think it was the first time i realized what it meant to be an olympian
4766520 it really hit me that i had accomplished a dream ive had all my life
4766521 ive watched every opening ceremony on tv since 92 and then to actually be in the infield for one was pretty cool
4766522 im definitely going to have to have the perfect race and be on top of my game going into it but i think its going to be that way for everybody
4766523 last year in osaka i proved i could run in that heat
4766524 i think it was a matter of me never giving myself a break
4766525 i always wanted to train through everything the shorter runs allowed me to run harder and also give my body a rest i think it just saves the body
4766526 being there in the athletes village theres a bunch of energy and a ton of adrenaline and eventually that wears on you
4766527 the hotel were staying at has ping pong bowling darts and theres even a movie theater so theres plenty of things to do
4766528 if im lucky enough to make the final i dont think its going to be a slow race because theres too many kickers
4766529 i have a feeling its going to be a pretty quick race i think the pace will be up and down but the last five six laps are going to be all out
4766530 i think it was the first time i realized what it meant to be an olympian
4766531 it really hit me that i had accomplished a dream ive had all my life
4766532 ive watched every opening ceremony on tv since 92 and then to actually be in the infield for one was pretty cool
4766533 im definitely going to have to have the perfect race and be on top of my game going into it but i think its going to be that way for everybody
4766534 last year in osaka i proved i could run in that heat
4766535 i think it was a matter of me never giving myself a break
4766536 i always wanted to train through everything the shorter runs allowed me to run harder and also give my body a rest i think it just saves the body
4766537 being there in the athletes village theres a bunch of energy and a ton of adrenaline and eventually that wears on you
4766538 the hotel were staying at has ping pong bowling darts and theres even a movie theater so theres plenty of things to do
4766539 if im lucky enough to make the final i dont think its going to be a slow race because theres too many kickers
4766540 i have a feeling its going to be a pretty quick race i think the pace will be up and down but the last five six laps are going to be all out
4766541 theres no way id view myself as anything close to a favorite but as long as i do my job and get to the final then you race hard and hang in there and anything can happen
4766542 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday
4766543 if i play good everything will take care of itself thats what im going to focus on just playing my round you know its my last tournament so i want to end on a good note hopefully ill be a really good one
4766544 they always have such a great golf course and always the condition of the golf course i realize this week is not easy because the rough is so long probably the longest rough of the year i think
4766545 i didnt really start making birdies until the back nine but i really enjoyed it
4766546 its important to be in good position for the weekend
4766547 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4766548 i had a lot of great up and downs today there were a few holes where it could have gone either way and i just grinded it through im proud of myself for shooting under par today and it sets me up for saturday and sunday

4766553 on the back nine my caddie mike powell and i were reciting bible verses and i just lost track of what score i was at
4766554 this is one of the best tournaments on the tour
4766555 i guess that coming from a kind of sister country australia theres a good vibe
4766556 oh my god i really did not mean to do that
4766557 i mean bleep i feel gut shot right now it was a hard day for everybody i didnt do my job none of the americans did their job
4766558 weve got a lot of pride and we took a shot to it if i can be blunt
4766559 where were from we take a lot of pride in what we do and this was a rough night silver is better than nothing
4766560 a lot of people both in the throwing world and outside the throwing world have come down on christian for not performing at the level that we expect him to perform
4766561 the reality is hes a huge man and a very powerful man and when he lines everything up it goes really far we expect it all the time he has dealt with this pressure for a long time

4766575 its a great honor to be the team captain that means a lot of people think really highly of me as a person not just an athlete
4766576 its one of those things where its so hard just to make it here and just to be here and compete here were all champions
4766577 if you look at the olympic spirit and the olympic creed its about the struggle and the fight and the journey ellipsis and thats whats beautiful about being here this is a journey and i love it and thats why im still doing it
4766578 i think this is the one time where age is helping me

4766586 the accident took place late friday night on the outskirts of etah as the driver of the private bus lost control over the vehicle
4766587 and signed agreements for the first time and high levels it has been the signing of the agreement with the iranian side of iraq b 4500 megawatts
4766588 the bureaucratic border procedures inspection and a decrease in the quantities processed is one of the most important thing hindered the processing of fuel stations
4766589 appears in the stations electrical sadr city east baghdad which hoped to operate at 320 megawatts a fraction resolution implemented on a welcome iran
4766590 power station alhaidariya in najaf governorate which is a gift from the iranian people to the iraqi people in terms of funding
4766591 negotiations to equip iraq 7900 megawatts of electricity in a project involving large international companies
4766592 the highest production of electric power since the ninth day of april of the year 2003 at six thousand mw
4766593 das kann sein ja das ist eine durchaus interessante perspektive es setzt aber das bekenntnis der gemeinsamkeit voraus wichtig sind gemeinsame pr sentationen man muss zeigen dass man etwas gemeinsam will denn der beginn der krisenhaften entwicklung war ja dass gusenbauer in der pressestunde seine steuerideen verbreitet hat das war ein erpresserischer akt gegen ber der vp so geht man in einer partnerschaft einfach nicht miteinander um
4766594 selbstverst ndlich das ist doch klar schauen wir zur ck die jahre 2000 bis 2006 waren erfolgreiche jahre f r sterreich die volkspartei war in den ersten beiden dieser jahre nicht erster 2002 wurden wir erster und auch dieses mal trete ich an um erster zu werden das ist mein ziel
4766595 durch die vielen m glichen konstellationen muss es auch in sterreich denkbar sein eine stabile regierung mit drei partnern zu bilden aber auch andere noch flexiblere formen sind m glich
4766596 ja definitiv denn strache geht einen kurs der nicht gut f r sterreich ist der strache kurs ist ein schwerer schaden f r das land also nicht mit jemandem der sterreich in eine sackgasse f hrt
4766597 also in der frage der sicherheit sage ich klar dass eine versch rfung und klarstellung im asylrecht notwendig ist
4766598 she was a great cook born in oklahoma and came out here to pick grapes when she was a little girl during the great depression her family lived in a train car down in the guasti area
4766599 itll be a little more of the corporate feel but without the corporate mentality
4766600 youve already got the dennys cocos and carrows of the world the big corporate chains we thought there was a need in the marketplace for a similar concept but better portioning and service
4766601 they didnt know anything about the restaurant business when they started this
4766602 in our generation you didnt go out to eat much because no one had any money so she turned out to be quite the cook
4766603 its not the same as it used to be when people didnt go out to dinner because times got tough there are still two income families who need to eat out and need a more affordable place to eat than a high end steakhouse
4766604 yeah i was really offended by that but it was part true
4766605 it wasnt that i didnt like to hit i just really wasnt that good at tackling i love to hit in this game you have to love to hit but we all have our weaknesses and thats something im getting better at every day
4766606 i should have got the sack but he threw it before i could get there
4766607 i put my hands up i learned that from dawkins dawkins always puts his hands up
4766608 if im on the field something is going to happen thats a proven fact and more good than bad
4766609 you think about a play like that as a little kid playing ball
4766610 you always dream about stuff like that happening but you never know how youre going to react the crazy thing is you feel like youve been there before because youve pictured it over and over in your head so many times
4766611 everyone was telling me i should have kept the football but im a rookie and i didnt know we could my first fumble recovery and my first interception all in the same game next time im going to have to hold onto the football a little bit more
4766612 kick returning punt returning interceptions theres a certain feeling you get when the ball is in your hands especially when youre on defense any opportunities you get you want to make the most of it
4766613 im not going to make a big commotion out of it
4766614 it will speak for itself and it is speaking for itself
4766615 you cant hold a good man down i know the player i am and i just have to make the most of the opportunities i get
4766616 we knew we needed to make changes in the way we went about recruiting players but we didnt want to be ad hoc or seem to be making it up as we went along
4766617 myself and gary sat down and broke it down into four aspects identifying where the players are recruitment which is different because its about actually getting the players to your club training and then finally development you cannot do the last three without getting the first one right and that is what we regarded as the prime target of the summer
4766618 probably about 70 per cent of the players in the premier league come from the continent but we had no network there
4766619 if we are going to make the best decisions then you have to have the best information so we recruited the best people possible and gave them the best facilities and provisions
4766620 it is possible now because of the low cost airlines to get these officers out twice a week to report back the intelligence from the countries we designated
4766621 we appointed an eastern european scout paying particular interest to the countries which will be coming into the common market in the next couple of years
4766622 our western european scout will be covering places like spain portugal france and a little bit in germany and holland
4766623 and our northern european scout will be covering the scandinavian countries including denmark latvia and lithuania
4766624 we also put together three software packages two of which are completely exclusive to us which will enable us to identify any player on the planet and have film and intelligence on him within 12 hours
4766625 i tried to do the same at macclesfield even when we were bottom of league two
4766626 people will have seen at mk dons that we also played very good football i want us to do exactly the same at blackburn
4766627 carlos is a young kid but hes an exceptional talent
4766628 he could prove to be a surprise package in the premier league this season
4766629 its difficult because i dont want to put too much pressure on the kid
4766630 at the end of the day hes only 21 and come in from another country it will take time for him to settle
4766631 i know that more than anybody having gone to italy during my career it took me a couple of months to settle before i started playing half decent
4766632 but carlos is techincally very very gifted he scores lovely goals has a lovely left foot and can open up defences hes definitely a flair player
4766633 he can play in the hole on the wing and he also played in midfield for his previous club
4766634 i dont know who i could compare him with i dont think hed want me to compare him with anybody
4766635 hes his own person with his own identity but we are all excited about him
4766636 it is a shame because he always seems to score against everton
4766637 robbie has done well here his last game was in october last year thats a long time ago
4766638 but hes trained ever so well in trying to get his sharpness back
4766639 hes still got what it takes some of the things ive seen in training from robbie over the last three or four days have been mind blowing hes still got it
4766640 if he contiunes to work hard in training getting his sharpness and fitness right then he will be an asset to us
4766641 we will sit down with robbie and the chairman next week and work something out
4766642 hes a premier league player definitely a premier league goalscorer but he needs to improve on his sharpness and fitness
4766643 los constantes accidentes que tienen lugar en la a 1 a la altura de el molar demuestran el riesgo que entra a el no acometer obras necesarias
4766644 e hizo que un fallecido y dos heridos se sumaran a la larga lista de v ctimas de la a 1 uno de los puntos negros de la comunidad de madrid
4766645 tal y como han reivindicado los vecinos de la zona que se manifestaron para conseguirlo bajo el lema menos talante y m s variante
4766646 los constantes accidentes que tienen lugar en la a 1 a la altura de el molar demuestran el riesgo que entra a el no acometer obras necesarias
4766647 y todo el mundo pueda disfrutar de ellos con seguridad y tranquilidad
4766648 this is another example of a life saved rather than abandoned
4766649 we are really watching our american values slip away this has been happening for years
4766650 i think thats why people are grasping at anything thats american
4766651 i want to keep my roots and my roots are english pushing spanish is a step backwards
4766652 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4766653 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4766654 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4766655 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4766656 with carl crawford and evan longoria going down simultaneously i thought id make one last vain attempt to reach out to tampa bay and to no avail
4766657 thats because major league baseball has been successful in their pursuit in blackballing barry out of the game
4766658 we call on the british government to apologise for the immense suffering that has resulted from their imposition of section 377 and we call on the indian government to abandon this abhorrent alien legacy of the raj that should have left our shores when the british did
4766659 how long shall we stay in gori as long as we want to
4766660 we do feel let down do you blame us what happened to our allies we do not know what will happen in the future but it looks like we may lose parts of our country
4766661 ossetians are killing poor georgians this is a problem and we are trying to deal with it
4766662 i have a brief recollection of giving someone some cash
4766663 my assumption is i loaned some small amount of money to both of them
4766664 i do i dont see any other explanation she would not have a child with someone she doesnt love and she loves him
4766665 as our national company we should all be proud of opera australia however as it stands now not many people are
4766666 lets not destroy it for generations to come allowing it to fall into an abyss of mediocrity
4766667 certain allegations have been made and the board expressed complete confidence in the music director and the management of the company
4766668 with my work internationally i dont think that you could possibly say i dont have my standards
4766669 we have to balance doing really exciting new work with a standard repertoire but whatever we do we have to do it absolutely excellently
4766670 for thousands of years russians and georgians have been living together and now we have war and innocent people are dying it was all started by politicians and i dont understand why
4766671 i landed in the forest and didnt lose consciousness but i couldnt move shortly afterwards a first aid team came to me and gave me different medicines then i was transferred here
4766672 she said there will be peace and i believe her
4766673 i have only the best things to say about the way i have been treated
4766674 they spoke with me and told me that if they were taken to a hospital in russia they wouldnt get such good treatment
4766675 today paraguay breaks with its reputation for corruption breaks with the few feudal lords of the past
4766676 today marks the end of an exclusive paraguay a secretive paraguay a paraguay famous for corruption
4766677 we dream of a paraguay with social justice without hunger
4766678 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4766679 the head of our state has made it clear that the georgian side appearing in the future as peacekeepers is now after what has happened unacceptable to south ossetia
4766680 the russian president issued an order to the relevant authorities to start the adoption of extra security measures envisaged in the six point plan
4766681 as these security measures are implemented the withdrawal of forces sent to carry out this reinforcement operation will be carried out
4766682 the document signed by the georgian president differs from the one which was agreed
4766683 it totally omits the introductory part saying that these principles are supported by russia and france and calling on all sides to sign them
4766684 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 per cent
4766685 who invited the trouble here who invited the arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here not only those who perpetrated it but those who allowed it to happen
4766686 adalah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam apabila memakai gamis dia mendahulukan yang kanan
4766687 siapa yang menanggalkan pakaian yang mewah karena tawadlu kepada allah padahal ia dapat membelinya allah akan memanggilnya pada hari kiamat di muka sekalian manusia untuk disuruh memilih sendiri pakaian iman yang mana yang ia kehendaki untuk dipakainya
4766688 adalah lengan baju rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam hanya sampai pergelangan tangan hr abu dawud dan tirmidzi
4766689 allah tidak akan melihat dengan rahmat pada hari kiamat kepada siapa saja yang memakai menurunkan kainnya kerena sombong
4766690 loh yang penting kan niat kita ikhlas akh kata antum penulis pen kan allah menilai kita dari hati lagian kenapa sih antum sok peduli sama akhwat
4766691 come watch me someday youll meet a man youll want to cook for

4766693 while posilac is a strong product for the business we believe repositioning the business with a strategic owner will allow monsanto to focus on the growth of its core seeds and traits business while ensuring that loyal dairy farmers continue to receive the value of posilac in their operations
4766694 so do not weaken and do not grieve for you will indeed be superior if you are truly believers
4766695 allahs wrath is great upon the people who besmeared his messengers face with blood
4766696 fear your sins more than you fear the enemy as your sins are more dangerous to you than your enemy we muslims are only victorious over our enemy because their sins outnumber ours not for any other reason if our sins were equal to those of our enemy then they would defeat us due to their superior numbers and resources
4766697 by allah i will never imprison you again for drinking alcohol
4766698 by allah i will never again touch alcohol after this day
4766699 so do not weaken and do not grieve for you will indeed be superior if you are truly believers
4766700 maximize demand minimize supply and buy the rest from the people who hate us the most
4766701 wind is a very capital intensive industry and financial institutions are not ready to take congressional risk they say if you dont get the production tax credit we will not lend you the money to buy more turbines and build projects
4766702 where the priorities of congress could become so distorted by politics
4766703 last year we were less than 8 percent and even most of that was manufacturing for overseas markets
4766704 i thought this was nice at one point during the olympic ceremony tonight they had 56 children march in all belonging to john edwards jay leno
4766705 come up with something equally bold for john to do
4766706 we would prefer if they have made the choice to vote absentee that they do it as soon as possible
4766707 it looks at this point like it will be a very heavy ballot as far as a lot of state issues and local issues it would be very advantageous for a lot of people to get their absentee ballots and have plenty of time to read them and go over them before they make their decisions
4766708 after someone registers to vote we have to send them a card and it has to go through the mail we cant hand it to them
4766709 if that card comes back undeliverable then we can flag that ballot because we dont open and count it until election day
4766710 we can flag it if we think for some reason because of the return mailing the folks arent where they said they were living and we can go about getting that cleared up before election day
4766711 unfortunately people who do not vote in every election dont understand that in a presidential election the candidates names are on the ballot with all the other federal and other offices along with all the issues
4766712 for some reason voters think they are separate ballots and they are not
4766713 voters go to the polls prepared only to vote for president and when they get there they then have all of the other offices up for election and a multitude of questions and issues to answer and they are totally unprepared
4766714 with the length of the ballot it really takes a long time
4766715 thats one good reason for folks to get an absentee ballot and vote at home they have lots of time to go through there and make those decisions
4766716 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4766717 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4766718 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives

4766738 barack obama thinks the solution to high gasoline prices is punitive taxes on exxon all this in the background could not have failed to reassure mr putin that the west would not invest political capital in protecting the interests of its oil companies he learned that his allies could go so far as to commit nuclear terrorism so it has been alleged to murder one of his political critics in london without consequences why expect any blowback from merely repeatedly defrauding western energy investors

4766760 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
4766761 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
4766762 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
4766763 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
4766764 i thought collage great way to talk about systems of power and pop culture we were using the media to talk about the media
4766765 the more negativland started appropriating media the more we thought about it means
4766766 the schools stare fixedly into the past as we hurtle pell mell into the future

4766775 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
4766776 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4766777 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4766778 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
4766779 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
4766780 its shameful that so many corporations make big profits and pay nothing to support our country
4766781 half of all business income in the united states now ends up going through the individual tax code
4766782 its time for the big corporations to pay their fair share
4766783 discredited rumors and allegations about his patriotism and personal life

4766796 this is a very rare pregnancy something i have never witnessed over my past 33 years in this profession
4766797 inflicting great harm on our economy and on america workers
4766798 skillful handling of such a crisis could be the difference between temporary hardship and far reaching disaster
4766799 russia has become more aggressive toward the now democratic nations that broke free of the old soviet empire
4766800 russia also holds vast petroleum wealth and this heavy influence in the oil and gas market has become a strategic weapon that russia is clearly prepared to use
4766801 all of this only adds to the urgency of producing more of our own energy including americas enormous oil reserves that lie offshore
4766802 on energy policy my opponent and his allies in congress offer only half measures or no measures at all as in their shared opposition to offshore drilling
4766803 the president informed participants of the security council meeting that he had just now signed the six point plan
4766804 i dont know what to say ive been dreaming of this moment for a long time and its here im just so proud to be canadian
4766805 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4766806 i remember the 70s waiting in line for gas what have we done since then shame on us
4766807 its unconscionable for the state bureaucracy to be blocking approvals when families and businesses are suffering daily from outrageous energy costs
4766808 it seems as though theres too much wind in the newark offices of the bpu and not enough determination to get offshore windmills tested promptly
4766809 if you dont take the first step youre not going to get there
4766810 this is the first time we are considering offshore wind
4766811 it is one of the first times in the united states its been considered its something you want to do right
4766812 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
4766813 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
4766814 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
4766815 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
4766816 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
4766817 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
4766818 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
4766819 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
4766820 and i dont like to text message because id rather call somebody on the telephone
4766821 i do understand the importance of the computer i understand the importance of the blogs
4766822 does drive the news it is changing the shape of the news its changing the information age and ive got to stay up with it
4766823 but i am forcing myself let me put it this way i am using the computer more and more every day
4766824 hopefully ill be able to show people a new one
4766825 obviously we would have loved to have brought home more medals for the u s
4766826 we did the best we could were not asking for more at this point next time well ask for a little more
4766827 im sure all the fans in russia will be very happy about it
4766828 i didnt sleep enough im just really happy that i could put all my energy into the match and pull out the match
4766829 but i also accepted it because for me doesnt matter
4766830 i just want to enjoy this moment because its a huge moment in my career
4766831 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4766832 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4766833 i just didnt stick to my race plan and got pushed about a bit
4766834 we will have to improve if we want to repeat the success we had last season
4766835 the more we win the more other people want to knock us off our perch
4766836 they have great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row
4766837 there was a bit of a flat period in the third quarter other than that i was pretty pleased with the players
4766838 the discipline was good the boys were getting very frustrated out there there were hands on the ball the 10 metres was non existent at times and it was hard to get any momentum
4766839 were getting confidence yet we know there is a whole lot more in us
4766840 im still trying to work out why we got a man sent to the sin bin im very frustrated with that we really didnt get a chance
4766841 the poles should be thanked for helping reveal the strategic goal of the u s missile defense plan
4766842 this is a march for freedom a march for honor and a march against occupation
4766843 all issues can be resolved only through dialogue and peaceful means
4766844 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4766845 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4766846 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4766847 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4766848 police were called to the premises at 7 48pm on thursday august 14 where they found the body lying on the remains of a bonfire in the grounds
4766849 police are treating the death as unexplained at present and are hoping that the results of the post mortem forensic tests and other available evidence will enable them to focus the inquiry in a positive direction
4766850 he was respectful but there had been trouble at this party
4766851 someone told me that connor was thought to have said something to someone which he denied it all then got out of hand and there was a commotion and he ended up getting stabbed
4766852 he wasnt the sort of lad who would look for trouble but he would back himself up
4766853 two isaf service members died as a result of wounds suffered during an ied strike and small arms fire attack on their patrol in eastern afghanistan today
4766854 what passes for optimism is most often the effect of an intellectual error
4766855 a lot has been written on the importance of designing for images off but the example email below really highlights the missed opportunities that many marketers face when they fail to design properly
4766856 getting your email to look great in all the major email clients can be a challenge at times so weve done the hard work for you with these free email templates weve tested them in the major clients so add your own content and youre all set
4766857 but these things i plan wont happen right away slowly steadily surely the time approaches when the vision will be fulfilled if it seems slow be patient for it will surely take place it will not be late by a single day
4766858 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4766859 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4766860 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4766861 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4766862 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4766863 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4766864 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4766865 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4766866 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4766867 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4766868 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4766869 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4766870 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4766871 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4766872 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4766873 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4766874 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4766875 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4766876 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4766877 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4766882 when someone says you cant do something it just shows you anything is possible
4766883 when you put your mind to something and you really focus on doing it anything is possible
4766884 the thongs are only part of it its still a mystery to us
4766885 as long as we dont find him we have to keep that hope
4766886 were just engineers and software people out of silicon valley with mortgages to pay and kids in school
4766887 but we want to do something besides sell products to the west more than just the next gizmo that goes on a cell phone
4766888 they saw this thing with battery connections and circuit boards and wouldnt allow it on the flight
4766889 this is so close to our hearts and so important that were stepping out of the high tech startup field
4766890 its amazing to watch them from a distance the enormous growth the sense that they can make a difference as a kid
4766891 cash and i have been glued to the olympics how amazing was the opening ceremony i still dont know how they co ordinated 2008 people to move in perfect sync

4766894 i think theres something about being inside there you get lost in the place you dont hear the trucks going by and the planes overhead
4766895 its kind of a neat thing what we were hoping for
4766896 september 12 is going to be the first time i havent dealt with september 11th
4766897 population studies have consistently linked drinking alcohol to an increased risk of female breast cancer
4766898 but there has been little data most of it conflicting about an independent role played by the choice of beverage type
4766899 statistical analyses limited to strata of wine preferrers beer preferrers spririts preferrers or non preferrers each showed that heavier drinking compared to light drinking was related to breast cancer risk in each group
4766900 this strongly confirms the relation of ethyl alcohol per se to increased risk
4766901 the coronary benefit from drinking red wine may also be related to favourable drinking patterns common among wine drinkers or to the favourable traits of wine drinkers as evidenced by us and danish studies
4766902 this has been fascinating research our group has been involved in studies of alcohol drinking and health for more than three decades including in the area of heart disease we are fortunate to have data available about a large multi ethnic population with a variety of drinking habits

4766962 mike has been saying hes going to win the 100 fly at the olympics for the last year
4766963 if it was up to me i would just drop the protest
4766964 im stoked with what happened im very very happy i dont want to fight this it is a gold medal at stake its a difficult thing to lose but you have to understand that i came into this competition with the goal to win a bronze medal i went my best time and did better than bronze
4766965 i didnt do it to provoke anger i didnt do it to provoke violence
4766966 it has always been a goal of mine but i never really expected it at this moment in time

4766972 i want the guy who doesnt even think about whether he can do it hes already planning how hes going to get it done
4766973 but he also doesnt stand around and expect people to stare at him
4766974 hes the kind of guy who would trip over the crack walking down the sidewalk
4766975 essentially they found through fairly exhaustive studies that the new generation silicone implants are safe for people
4766976 the main factor is that leaking does not cause tissue problems simply put we dont want silicone leaking into our systems
4766977 to date dr leveque has used silicone implants in 99 of her patients i have used the implants in 73 cases in pensacola
4766978 when you have surgery you lose a lot of breast volume
4766979 i knew the silicone implants were more natural feeling and looking i feel comfortable making the decision to have them
4766980 fda has reviewed an extensive amount of data from clinical trials of women studied for up to four years as well as a wealth of other information to determine the benefits and risks of these products
4766981 the extensive body of scientific evidence provides reasonable assurance of the benefits and risks of these devices this information is available in the product labeling and will enable women and their physicians to make informed decisions
4766982 its basically showing that this particular agent can change some of the mammary function but its a real leap to say that it may be useful in cancer prevention
4766983 we are currently testing a more specific anti progesterone drug to see whether it has the same effect and if thats proven well go to a small clinical trial to see if that anti progesterone is effective in a high risk population
4766984 i had just got divorced a couple of months before i found out so it was a bad year all around
4766985 i was afraid that breast cancer would run genetically in a female
4766986 younger women in general have a harder time finding one another to discuss the issues related to their breast cancer and treatment
4766987 the only technique that has been actually shown to work is the ivf prior to chemotherapy
4766988 to date there is no evidence that having a pregnancy after a diagnosis of breast cancer increases the risk that a breast cancer would return
4766989 she was initially told oh you have nothing to worry about youre too young to get breast cancer
4766990 enrolling our first patient prior to year end should facilitate us achieving our psoriasis development timelines
4766991 we are confident that isa247 will continue to demonstrate a strong safety and efficacy profile when directly compared to cyclosporine
4766992 im very excited to begin working more closely with acs they are a well respected member of the billiards industry and we are pleased to be able to offer special savings to their players
4766993 amateur pool players playing competitively in leagues with their friends are a major driving force in pool today and our association with american cuesports will help us to better serve this large segment of the market
4766994 we strive to offer the lowest prices possible on the equipment pool players need typically our prices are about 20 below regular retail prices though the additional discount will deeply cut into our margins we feel that the increased exposure to the tens of thousands of acs members will ultimately be worthwhile
4766995 it is so puzzling and it is not a good public health message
4766996 i dont want women to use this as an excuse to be overweight therefore its even more important for us to find out what the mechanisms are i mean the last thing we want is in this day and age to advise people to gain weight
4766997 now were back to square one in trying to explain with which kind of mechanisms a larger body size might protect women from breast cancer
4766998 if we just detect the cancer later and therefore delay the time of diagnosis of the cancer into their post menopausal years then that might be an explanation
4766999 our message to cancer survivors absolutely is eating well being active is really important to get you through cancer treatment and certainly as you look forward to that life beyond cancer
4767000 there is much more evidence that being overweight as a cancer survivor has some really bad effects
4767001 in particular for breast cancer survivors breast cancer survivors who are overweight at diagnosis or have gained weight after diagnosis are more likely to have cancer occurrence and also are more likely to die of that cancer
4767002 eat a wide variety of fruits and vegetables eat a lot of whole grains breads cereals pastas cut back on high fat meat high fat dairy products
4767003 watch the amount of saturated fats you eat these are the same type of things we tell anybody that is trying to improve their health and reduce their risk of chronic disease
4767004 if you are sexually active then i think you should get it
4767005 its a good thing for people to be aware of even if they arent sexually active

4767012 son this is my first christmas without you in 28 years today i am extremely jealous of my god he knew you before you were born and let me borrow you for a while how my heart aches for you the other morning i awoke at 3am to someone crying it was me crying in my sleep
4767013 die blessure heeft me teruggeworpen in mijn trainingsarbeid maar dat is geen excuus want mijn hamstring voelde goed

4767030 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
4767031 i never said he wasnt qualified the constitution sets qualification for the president and then the people decide who they think would be the better president
4767032 the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4767033 mr president former secretary of state colin powell says the world is beginning to doubt the moral basis of our fight against terrorism
4767034 if a former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and former secretary of state feels this way dont you think that americans and the rest of the world are beginning to wonder whether youre following a flawed strategy
4767035 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic
4767036 its just i simply cant accept that its unacceptable to think that theres any kind of comparison between the behavior of the united states of america and the action of islamic extremists who kill innocent women and children to achieve an objective
4767037 governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government

4767040 we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract

4767042 they pick the most dangerous enemy they can find and its themselves
4767043 the tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout there are weapons that are simply thoughts attitudes prejudices to be found only in the minds of men
4767044 for the record prejudices can kill and suspicion can destroy and a thoughtless frightened search for a scapegoat has a fallout all its own for the children and the children yet unborn
4767045 a media campaign to create a wedge between the american people and their government
4767046 in the 1920s a failed austrian painter published a book in which he explained his intention to build an aryan super state in germany and take revenge on europe and eradicate the jews
4767047 the world ignored hitlers words and paid a terrible price
4767048 we must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law
4767049 it demands the deep analysis and the sober contemplation of every american

4767053 mhc genes churn out substances that tell the body whether a cell is a native or an invader when individuals with different mhc genes mate their offsprings immune systems can recognize a broader range of foreign cells making them more fit
4767054 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
4767055 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
4767056 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the contraceptive pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odors
4767057 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
4767058 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby
4767059 the pill is in effect mirroring a natural shift but at an inappropriate time
4767060 it rarely happens that the mastermind of such a conspiracy can be arrested so soon after an attack of this scale
4767061 these men belong to the outlawed students islamic movement of india simi and were deeply involved in the attacks in ahmedabad

4767081 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4767082 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4767083 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives

4767126 there were many times i didnt pray for another day and i didnt pray for another hour i prayed for another minute to keep going
4767127 theres no doubt that my faith was strengthened and reinforced and tested because sometimes you have a tendency to say why am i here
4767128 we knew we had to have some belief greater than ourselves
4767129 we decided we needed to be all on the same sheet of music at least one time during the week

4767131 we agreed that we were going to have a church service and told the vietnamese and they said no
4767132 the vietnamese broke in and seized the people who were standing against the wall doing the service
4767133 they marched them out of the room at gunpoint so i stood up and started singing the star spangled banner god bless america my country tis of thee and every song we could think of
4767134 we wanted to actually just have a chance to do what we felt was a fundamental human right and we got spiritual comfort from being able to worship together
4767135 we thought look if were going to be together then were going to stand up theyd done so many bad things that we werent nearly as afraid of them as maybe we would have been if a lot of us hadnt gone through what wed gone through
4767136 render unto caesar what is caesars and render unto god what is gods
4767137 what i was trying to tell my fellow prisoners is that we were doing caesars work when we got into prison so we should ask for gods help to do the right thing and for us to get out of prison if it be gods will for us to do so
4767138 the god we had come to know wasnt going to wave a magic wand and poof we would all be free the god we knew would give us the strength to endure what we had to do and it was up to us to take that strength and knowledge and do what we had to do

4767179 la verdadera parodia de todo esto es que los delitos de los que el sr hamdan fue absuelto fueron los nicos delitos de los que fue acusado inicialmente en el a o 2004 fue absuelto de todos esos delitos los nicos cargos de los que fue declarado culpable fueron los que se agregaron despu s de los hechos en virtud de la ley de comisiones militares del a o 2006 mucho despu s de que fuera encerrado aqu en la bah a de guant namo

4767186 die koalitionsaussage werden wir n chstes jahr machen aber das abzuschreiben nach dem motto es k nne nur noch dreierb ndnisse geben halte ich f r falsch
4767187 diejenigen insbesondere in washington die derzeit mit sehr starken worten eindruck in der welt machen wollen bringen die probleml sung nicht n her sondern sorgen f r eine verh rtung einseitige schuldzuweisungen helfen nicht weiter beide seiten haben sich nicht korrekt verhalten das muss nachdr cklich auch kritisiert werden
4767188 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4767189 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4767190 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4767191 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4767192 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4767193 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4767194 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4767195 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4767196 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4767197 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4767198 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4767199 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4767200 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4767201 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4767202 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4767203 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4767204 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4767205 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4767206 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4767207 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4767208 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4767209 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4767210 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4767211 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4767212 ich mach mist aber ich bin v llig berfordert mit der frage wie ich es anders machen kann
4767213 so schlimm ist das nicht es hat mir auch nicht geschadet
4767214 the good news about jesus the answer to our basic need
4767215 there is no one righteous not even one there is no one who understands no one who seeks god all have turned away they have together become worthless there is no one who does good not even one for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
4767216 we who are jews by birth and not gentile sinners know that a man is not justified by observing the law but by faith in christ
4767217 this mystery is that through the gospel the gentiles are heirs together with israel members together of one body and sharers together in the promise in christ jesus
4767218 why did you allow evil to enter the universe anyhow
4767219 it focuses attention upon the god who acts whose past election and redemption of provided the pledge of his activity in the future jesus declares that the critical moment has come god begins to act in a new and decisive way bringing his promise of ultimate redemption to the point of fulfillment by sovereign decision god makes this point in time the critical one in which all the moments of promise and fulfillment in the past find their significance in one awesome moment

4767228 ik weet niet eens wat ik zie elf althans niet echt zag jij wat ik zag
4767229 lieve b het is helemaal niet een kwestie van zien het is een kwestie van weten voelen alles is er al je bent het allemaal zelf
4767230 ja daar word ik nu zo moe van ik wil niet altijd maar alles zelf zijn dat voelt zo eenzaam
4767231 is het niet allemaal wat zoet die beelden en hoe jij nu doet
4767232 die angst is werkelijk niet belangrijk b als je wist hoe nietig en onbenullig angst uiteindelijk is het heeft niet eens een naam
4767233 draak dit is zon vreemd gevoel ik kan het helemaal niet beschrijven als ik met haar ben dan klopt het heel erg dan voelt het alsof het zo hoort en als ze er niet is dan is er een dof gevoel in mijn hoofd alsof het allemaal niet klopt maar als ik dat zeg dan klopt het eigenlijk ook weer niet
4767234 oh draak wat nu in godsnaam ik hoor die muziek gitaar en een mooie stem is liefde nou echt zo moeilijk bereikbaar
4767235 ja dat was het zeker tis alleen ik voel niets meer alsof ik verdoofd ben
4767236 kan er nou niet eens een wondertje gebeuren ik bedoel iets dat je zegt van ja iets waardoor het allemaal in een wat beter perspectief komt te staan
4767237 ik weet niet hoe dit goed moet aflopen draak ik waag me maar niet aan scenarios maar ik weet echt niet hoe dit goed zou kunnen aflopen het is zo mooi en ik ben dankbaar maar er zit ook een afgrond in de buurt die niet voor de poes is
4767238 dat het mooi is is een feit die afgrond is geen feit
4767239 ik ben voor het eerst echt bang voor de toekomst draak
4767240 nou ik zou zeggen wees blij dat je er een hebt
4767241 ok ok ik ben ook blij daarom en er is alleen het nu tis alleen ik vind dat wel erg zwaar hoor alleen maar leven in het nu
4767242 het is omgekeerd niet leven in het nu is zwaar
4767243 wat let je om honderd en n initiatieven te nemen per dag
4767244 nee gaan slapen doe gewoon iets nog voor je slapen gaat waar je geen controle over hebt althans niet over de uitkomst
4767245 tuurlijk doe nog niets iets wat riskant is niet groot maar ook niet klein je zult zien dat je daar beter van slaapt
4767246 i 25 will be closed for just a short period of time but its necessary to ensure a safe event for attendees
4767247 while we recognize that motorists traveling through the area will likely experience some delay we are doing everything possible to keep those delays to a minimum
4767248 motorists traveling through the area will likely experience some delay
4767249 you dont have to continue on like this you dont have to replicate this just because your parents behaved like this you can change the way in which you operate and i will help you to do that
4767250 there are different characters in each piece but it all feels like a connected event
4767251 there are certainly different scenes on the record and thats what i like and i think that takes real talent as a writer to fictionalize a reality the way inara has done
4767252 there was more love going through the glass with inara and van dyke than any other record ive worked on
4767253 whats good for the goose is also good for the gander
4767254 we couldnt believe it when we found out he had heard our music and wanted to play on it we flew out to arizona where we got to meet him and watch him record his tracks it was surreal
4767255 this was the best thing that could happen to us
4767256 we feel we know who we are now musically and know where we want to go this gives us more control and independence i like the spot were in with the industry the way it is it works well for us
4767257 there have definitely been a number of ups and downs but were definitely fired up
4767258 we want to get exposure for this album any way we can radio video viral internet were going to hit everything and tour as much as we can if we could be on the road all year long we would
4767259 we actually stole a 12 pack of beer and he was pissed so he was like come here you little dirty heads
4767260 we went from one bus to two buses to four buses
4767261 we loved the way the jack johnson and beastie boys albums sounded and we asked who mixed both of these albums
4767262 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4767263 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4767264 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4767265 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing

4767269 the u s is engaged in an antimissile defense for its own government and not for poland and poland in deploying elements of the system opens itself to a military strike that is 100 percent
4767270 it is written clearly we will use it in instances against governments that have nuclear weapons against allies of countries with nuclear weapons if they somehow enable them
4767271 becomes an actionable object those targets are destroyed in the first order
4767272 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
4767273 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
4767274 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
4767275 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
4767276 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
4767277 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
4767278 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
4767279 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
4767280 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4767281 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4767282 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives
4767283 towards the finish line i didnt know if i had made the finals or not
4767284 when i looked up and saw i didnt it was kind of devastating
4767285 when i get back to the olympic village its probably going to set in
4767286 my familys here everyones back home praying for me supporting me i just kind of feel i let them down a little bit
4767287 at the same time i did my best maybe i just ran out of time
4767288 i may have needed more races but i dont have any excuses
4767289 my hamstring feels good i wasnt too overwhelmed with this being the olympics i just kept trying to get my rhythm throughout each round
4767290 three weeks four weeks off because of the injury after running 9 7 9 6 it was just a back and forth battle reversing the negativity in my mind he said
4767291 appealing to the broadest possible audience without insulting anyones intelligence
4767292 i decided to focus my interview not on the obvious questions but on the more intricate details of pixar and the development of wall e
4767293 i feel bad for them if they want to hear this kind of music they have to go and make it
4767294 the mission of soderbergh in the park has always been to bring soderbergh to the masses
4767295 and that includes even his more inaccessible material those who are skeptical will be pleased to find that many of the traditional soderberghian themes are present in
4767296 i remember when i first saw oceans twelve i didnt get why the jokes were funny it was way too long and the plot was so incomprehensible that i nearly walked out of the theater
4767297 but since then i have come to appreciate the scope of the piece
4767298 though i admit that even after extensive study the ending still remains a mystery to me
4767299 i am also happy to report that our props department has created a perfectly detailed hologram of a golden egg
4767300 for many people the park is where they are first exposed to soderbergh
4767301 the outdoor setting fosters a more accommodating atmosphere for those who under more traditional circumstances are unwilling to give soderbergh a chance
4767302 ive started a few soderbergh movies but i can never get through them
4767303 the dialogue is hard to understand and the stories are confusing but i came out to the park last year and saw
4767304 he is considering himself the leader of two political parties the eastern front and the beja congress
4767305 this is not acceptable the eastern front was formed to represent all the people of the east whatever their ethnic group he has split us
4767306 we have frozen his membership what happens next is up to him
4767307 the eastern front will continue with members of the beja congress and work as one party up to now we have not had a meeting as the eastern front to agree on our activities we dont have a strategy no clear objectives
4767308 we have recovered four bodies this morning from one spot and two more from another these were civilians who were killed yesterday friday afternoon by the ethiopian troops
4767309 zult u zich wellicht afvragen ja dat is er altijd weer op elk gebied ook al is mijn museum nu alweer propvol ik kan er telkens weer een gaatje vinden voor dit of dat item

4767311 ello no ha afectado las expectativas de inflaci n a mediano plazo

4767316 no present en el primer semestre de 2008 un solo reporte de lavado de dinero
4767317 it was felt that his behavior on the medal podium and during the medal ceremony was not appropriate
4767318 his behavior was not in the olympic spirit of respect for his fellow athletes whatever grievances you may have this was not the way to go about it
4767319 the awards ceremony is a highly symbolic ritual acknowledged as such by all athletes and other participants
4767320 any disruption by any athlete in particular a medalist is in itself an insult to the other athletes and to the olympic movement it is also contrary to the spirit of fair play
4767321 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4767322 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4767323 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4767324 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4767325 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4767326 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4767327 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4767328 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4767329 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4767330 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately
4767331 i was not told that there would be any restrictions on me whatsoever after i was done with probation
4767332 strongly supports access to comprehensive affordable family planning services and age appropriate sex education
4767333 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4767334 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4767335 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing
4767336 the cfo says no when the president want to renovate the offices or hire new people and the company cant afford it thats part of her fiduciary responsibility you have a responsibility too you have to set expectations about what can be accomplished with the resources time and people available
4767337 it is amazing how much you can learn in a short period of time by spending time listening to the voice of the customer what is just as amazing is how much you can learn from talking to the people who spend forty hours a week listening to the customer
4767338 so on the 100th anniversary of the model t it seems worth tipping the toyota hat to henry ford and the production techniques he so cleverly harnessed those techniques put us all on wheels
4767339 the cell brings processes together thereby bringing people together the basic unit for natural work teams to form work zones that connected physically and in terms of work flow when the person working to either side of you directly depends on the work you do to be successful team spirit can take root
4767340 they could make fewer or at least better timed visits to the customer im guessing because they cant predict my oil use that well and if they targeted a refill at a 1 4 tank id run out of oil sometimes and whats horrible about it is a little extra free information is all theyd need to cut visits and still not have anyone run out of oil
4767341 treating the symptoms might make things better in the short term but we shouldnt be surprised when they return if the disease remains present thats where the systemic approaches come in they can help us find the structures at work creating our problems and they can help us test our theories about proposed solutions
4767342 unfortunately there are no short cuts to this process copying someone elses layout may end up being suboptimal for your needs
4767343 successful managers understand these interactions how they work and they manage them as well as the main effects
4767344 within the first few months at batesville casket i quickly noticed a significant weakness in our lean approach this weakness is very common among companies that try to follow the lean path of continuous improvement its the lack of total employee involvement and ill stress the total part
4767345 holy cow he gets it and believe it or not im not necessarily against all robots im against the danger of robots covering up or automating waste
4767346 this surprising psychology study finds that if one person in a group repeats the same opinion three times it has 90 of the effect of three different people in that group expressing the same opinion
4767347 everyone is capable of learning how to take care of the equipment if your people really are not capable than you have to ask yourself if you have hired the right people in the first place
4767348 dont say transparency and then only communicate to selected managers dont say employee engagement when you really want compliance
4767349 it is hard to imagine what management system creates such
4767350 frantic campaign has targeted many charities and service organizations by storming closing and confiscating the belongings of these organizations
4767351 without any legal justification just under the claim that they were closeto hamas in many cases the campaign targeted private businesses under a shameless accusation that the owners receive money from hamas
4767352 it was pretty tough theres an enormous amount of snow
4767353 we kept having to dig the tent out itd just get buried we couldve suffocated so one would have to get out and dig it out and then try and get back in and keep warm everythings soaking wet
4767354 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated
4767355 we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take
4767356 how plain wholesome and earthy are the colors of quadrupeds generally the commonest i should say is the tawny or various shades of brown answering to the russet which is the prevailing color of the earths surface perhaps and to the yellow of sands beneath the darker brown mingled with this answers to the darker colored soil of the surface the white of the polar bear ermine weasel etc answers to the snow the spots of the pards perchance to the earth spotted with flowers or tinted leaves of autumn the black perhaps to night and muddy bottoms and dark waters there are few or no bluish animals
4767357 and many of a hellish hue but for some reason hard to view earths bluish animals are few
4767358 for years she had found pleasure and solace in thoreaus prose and observations
4767359 we know this is a war between the west and russia
4767360 in the town of shenandoah penn parishioners at a local church offered up prayers for peace a peace that was broken the night of july 12 when luis ramirez an illegal immigrant from mexico was beaten to death
4767361 i never thought there was such underlying hatred or bigotry
4767362 if that happened to a white person every church in this god n f ing town wouldnt do a god n thing about it
4767363 just because theyre f ing border jumpers and came over here
4767364 we are proud and excited to have been selected by nbc sports and the olympic games
4767365 we worked closely with nbc and each olympic broadcast anchor to find the right fabrics and styles that would make them feel comfortable and pleasing to the eye
4767366 i dont think theres any question its a function of sponsor involvement and the sponsor involvement has a great deal to do with the economy
4767367 a company has to be 100 percent committed to motorsports in this kind of economy to be able to spend the money that it takes which goes back to part of the reason that i believe its not in our best interest to have 48 49 teams
4767368 how many cars did we have at daytona for the daytona 500 this year fifty or so actually 53
4767369 were having teams shut down every time a team shuts down there is somebody who is left unemployed
4767370 we put ourselves in a position where with this change of car count over a three year or four year period you go from 49 full time teams to maybe 44 thats a five team switch if you put 60 people on a team thats 300 people whose jobs are impacted by that
4767371 our sport would be so much more secure our employees would be so much more secure our sponsors would be so much more secure if we had 43 teams
4767372 there is no benefit in having more than 43 teams it only creates insecurity for sponsors for car owners for crew members
4767373 we need 43 teams to put on a race if we have 43 teams that we knew were going to be in the race then the sponsors investment is much more secure and at a time when the economy is iffy the sponsors that want to be involved in the sport want to know that theyre going to be in the race
4767374 the philosophy of having 48 cars all vying for 43 spots i know thats cool and everything or the thought that if youre not good enough you just go home because you dont deserve to be in the race but thats not economically sound
4767375 this is a time when you start seeing a negative side of having a bunch of teams the sponsorships are being spread out over more cars the cost of sponsorship is being de valued because they have more choices theres really no advantage in all that and our sport is less secure
4767376 i think there was a time in our country where you looked at the auto manufacturers as an empire that could never go away and i think today we cant look at it in that fashion which is sad
4767377 if you think about how big the american manufacturers are to the economy of america its huge the amount of employment the things that they do its unbelievable and its hard to see them struggling because it should be a source of pride for our country
4767378 theyre really struggling hard i dont think you can take them for granted anymore you think they always will be involved but they still have to be able to write the checks
4767379 forty three cars that are assured of being in the field is the best scenario for our sport
4767380 professional golf being the exception we are the only major sport that has to make the investment that we make and you dont know 100 percent that youre in the field
4767381 burton says fewer teams best for long term health of cup series
4767382 when i get back to the village its probably really going to set in my family is here everyone at home is supporting me and i feel i let them down a little bit
4767383 three weeks four weeks off because of the injury after running 9 7 9 6
4767384 it was just a back and forth battle reversing the negativity in my mind it was very difficult
4767385 i may have needed more races but i dont want to make any excuses

4767392 for myself i have to look backward for 5 years where i was dragged out from life methodist church to assist in the new senadin methodist campus gospel center smcgc ministry we started with around 7 8 persons and after five years when i look at it we now have around 70 persons for the mandarin service for this i thank god for i have truly witnessed a growth in terms of quantity however now as i join this course i wish to ascend to another level of growth of which is in terms of quality i wish to grow spiritually with all of you brothers and sisters at smcgc at lot of people had asked me why im still staying in senadin a petrol consuming distance from my work place well i guess my heart is still here with this center and i certainly hope that its not because ive considered this a comfort safe zone which im reluctant to leave
4767393 because in my heart of hearts i think i know that its
4767394 he knows how important this tour is to me and he knows my weaknesses and is using them against me instead of supporting me

4767401 the larger pharma companies want to have total control over the drugs in the pipelines
4767402 it looks as if pharma is going after the companies that have existing products
4767403 at some point you could see bayer wanting to control 100 of the assets
4767404 the fda is perceived to have swung more to the safety side in the balance between safety and efficacy
4767405 in my opinion it will be the first direct antiviral drug for hepatitis c to hit the market and meaningfully improve patient outcomes

4767408 because i have a lot to think about and i cant do it if youre emotionally in the middle of my thoughts you have a lot to think about too and you cant do it if im in the middle of the questions that you need answers to
4767409 i guess we are kinda in the same boat huh
4767410 if i wanted to be pregnant and was happy about it why in the world would i be here exploring my options and seeking guidance and counseling about what to do
4767411 i want to be able to consider all my options and im not even sure what all of those are
4767412 i know that i can keep the baby and get married or not i know that i can stay pregnant and give it up for adoption although i do not believe that is something that im going to want to do
4767413 but are you sure you want to do that given that you have a brand new life growing inside you at this very moment
4767414 i love just sitting and feeling my baby move i think about what he will be like and how wonderful it will be to hold him and love him and nurture him i think about what a gift from god he is and how i could never defy god
4767415 why would you want to kill something that you know is already alive and even though you didnt plan it it was created with a love that you already admit to sharing with its father why would you insult god like that
4767416 we have people who will pay for your prenatal care and support you through the pregnancy just dont kill your baby please youll live with the regret and shame all your life and it will haunt you every single time you look at other children or hold your own the bible says that children are a gift from god

4767422 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4767423 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4767424 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4767425 hon your heart is racing id like to think its because i just entered the room but its the mouse right
4767426 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu menolong agama allah nescaya dia akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu
4767427 ya allah aku pohonkan kemaafanmu daripada apa yg akan diturunkan dan aku pohonkan keredhaanmu daripada kemurkaanmu dan aku berlindung kpdmu daripadamu aku tidak dpt menghitung pujian terhadapmu seperti kamu memuji dirimu sendiri
4767428 malam ini adalan malam nisfu syaaban sesungguhnya allah azzawajjala telah dtg kpd hambanya pada malam nisfu syaaban dan memberi keampunan kpd mereka yg beristighfar memberi rahmat ke atas mereka yg memberi rahmat dan melambatkan rahmat dan keampunan terhadap orang2 yg dengki
4767429 pada hari ini aku telah sempurnakan bagi kamu agama kamu dan aku telah cukupkan nikmatku kepada kamu dan aku telah redakan islam itu menjadi agama untuk kamu
4767430 patutkah mereka mempunyai sekutu sekutu yang menentukan mana mana bahagian dari agama mereka sebarang undang undang yang tidak diizinkan oleh allah
4767431 barangsiapa mengada adakan perkara baru dalam urusan agama kita ini yang mana bukan sebahagian daripadanya akan tertolak
4767432 tetaplah kamu dengan sunnahku dan sunnah para khulafa rasyidun serta berpegang teguhlah padanya berwaspadalah terhadap perkara yang baru diada adakan kerana setiap perkara baru adalah bidah dan setiap perkara bidah itu adalah sesat
4767433 wahai orang orang yang beriman taatlah kamu kepada allah dan taatlah kamu kepada rasulullah dan kepada
4767434 dan katakanlah wahai muhammad kepada pengikut pengikutmu apa jua perkara agama yang kamu berselisihan padanya maka hukum pemutusnya terserah kepada allah hakim yang demikian kekuasaannya ialah allah tuhanku kepadanyalah aku berserah diri dan kepadanyalah aku rujuk kembali dalam segala keadaan
4767435 katakanlah wahai muhammad jika benar kamu mengasihi allah maka ikutilah daku nescaya allah mengasihi kamu serta mengampunkan dosa dosa kamu dan ingatlah allah maha pengampun lagi maha mengasihani
4767436 maka demi tuhanmu wahai muhammad mereka tidak disifatkan beriman sehingga mereka menjadikan engkau hakim dalam mana mana perselisihan yang timbul di antara mereka kemudian mereka pula tidak merasa di hati mereka sesuatu keberatan dari apa yang telah engkau hukumkan dan mereka menerima keputusan itu dengan sepenuhnya
4767437 yang demikian adalah lebih baik bagi kamu dan lebih elok pula kesudahannya
4767438 malam nisfu syaaban asalnya diutamakan oleh golongan tabiin di kalangan penduduk sham antaranya khalid bin midan makhul luqman bin amir dan lain lain di mana mereka beribadah bersungguh sungguh pada malam tersebut
4767439 barangsiapa melakukan apa sahaja amalan yang bukan sebahagian daripada urusan kita ini islam amalan itu akan tertolak
4767440 ibn waddah meriwayatkan bahawa zayd bin aslam berkata kami tidak pernah menemui seorang pun dari kalangan ulama dan and fuqaha kami yang memberi perhatian lebih kepada malam nisfu shaaban tidak ada juga yang memberi perhatian kepada hadith makhul atau yang beranggapan bahawa malam tersebut adalah lebih istimewa daripada malam malam lain
4767441 sekiranya aku dengar sendiri dia berkata begitu dan ada kayu di tanganku pasti aku akan memukulnya dengan kayu itu ziyad seorang pereka cerita
4767442 hadith yang berbunyi wahai ali barangsiapa bersolat seratus rakaat di malam nisfu shaaban dengan membaca pada setiap rakaat ummul kitab surah al fatihah dan qul huwallahu ahad sepuluh kali allah akan memenuhi segala keperluannya hadis ini maudhu rekaan semata mata
4767443 apabila tiba malam pertengahan syaaban penuhilah malamnya dengan solat dan berpuasalah di siang harinya
4767444 seratus rakaat di pertengahan syaaban membaca surah al ikhlas sepuluh kali di setiap rakaat hadis ini adalah maudhu direka dan kesemua perawi dalam tiga isnadnya adalah majhul tidak dikenali dan dhaif lemah katanya lagi dan dua belas rakaat membaca al ikhlaas tiga puluh kali setiap rakaat ini juga adalah maudhu dan empat belas rakaat juga adalah maudhu beberapa orang fuqaha telah tertipu oleh hadis palsu ini antaranya pengarang al ihya dan lain lain dan juga sebahagian ulama mufassirin solat khusus di malam ini di pertengahan bulan syaaban telah diterangkan dalam pelbagai bentuk kesemuanya adalah palsu dan direka reka
4767445 hadith tentang solat di malam pertengahan syaaban adalah maudhu dan disandarkan secara palsu terhadap rasulullah s a w
4767446 sembahyang yang dikenali sebagai solat didirikan sebanyak dua belas rakaat antara maghrib dan isyak pada malam jumaat pertama di bulan rejab dan sembahyang sunat malam nisfu shaaban sebanyak seratus rakaat kedua dua sembahyang ini adalah bidah yang tercela sepatutnya orang ramai tidak tertipu disebabkan ianya disebut dalam qut al qulub dan ihya ulum al din atau oleh hadis hadis yang disebutkan dalam kedua dua kitab ini kesemuanya adalah palsu orang ramai juga tidak sepatutnya tertipu disebabkan kerana beberapa imam telah keliru dalam hal ini dan menulis beberapa helaian yang menyebut bahawa sembahyang ini adalah mustahabb sunat kerana dalam hal ini mereka tersilap
4767447 barangsiapa yang mengada adakan perkara baru dalam urusan agama kita ini yang pada hakikatnya bukan sebahagian daripadanya tidak akan diterima
4767448 barangsiapa bersolat qiyam di bulan ramadan dengan penuh iman dan mengharapkan pahala allah akan ampunkan dosa dosanya yang telah lalu
4767449 barangsiapa memenuhi malam lailatul qadr dengan bersolat sunat disebabkan iman dan mencari pahala allah ampunkan kesemua dosanya yang telah lalu

4767457 most savers priority is the preservation of capital given todays uncertain economic outlook total safety for at least part of your savings is well worth considering
4767458 ive already expressed that to them i mean thats not an option
4767459 last season even though we had a poor season i was one of the players that suffered the most on the team because at the trade deadline we brought in even more guards and i saw my minutes drop and there really was no merit for that i really dont understand why my minutes dropped this year the problem is still the same i dont see it getting better maybe somewhere else is better for my career
4767460 yeah i guess thats safe to say unless something changes with the negotiations but i really dont see that happening right now

4767469 john was substituted in friday nights win over shamrock rovers with an injury to his right ankle
4767470 an x ray last night confirmed that there is no fracture and further examination this morning suggests that he has suffered soft tissue damage to the ankle
4767471 john will continue to receive treatment over the weekend and as the swelling continues to reduce a clearer picture of the extent of the injury will emerge
4767472 the injury will be assessed again on monday when it is hoped that a decision can be made with regard to johns recovery programme
4767473 it was a traumatic week for the club the manager and the players but at the end of the day we are paid to play football and thats what we did
4767474 hopefully we can get a home draw and a big gate and get things moving in the right direction again
4767475 you pound one of our allies and we will totally eviscerate one of yours
4767476 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
4767477 before you accuse me take a look at yourself by bo diddley

4767481 that from now on it will be unremarkable for a woman to win primary state victories unremarkable to have a woman in a close race to be our nominee unremarkable to think a woman could be president of the united states
4767482 if mothers ruled the world there would be no expletive wars in the first place
4767483 hes right to challenge a blind loyalty oath to the democratic party because its un american
4767484 you know as the climate changes the snows in the mountains out west melt faster that means theres drier conditions throughout the summer and then you get wildfires like this so were already seeing the impact in places around the world and its only going to get worse for our kids and grandkids
4767485 people have interjected their homes into a system that has a natural tendency to burn very frequently and where we have suppressed the frequency of those fires for so long theres an ungodly amount of fuel there
4767486 fire suppression logging and grazing on fire prone public land were intended to reduce the risk of fires but many western forests are now more flammable
4767487 ignited ground fuels can create enough heat to scorch a tree up to a height of 150 feet
4767488 reducing them should be the first priority of any wildfire management plan yet the practice of suppressing wildfires has allowed debris to accumulate to dangerous levels on he forest floor
4767489 we need to fight but we also need to be smart about it
4767490 illegal migrants really degrade the environment ive seen pictures of human waste garbage discarded bottles and other human artifact in pristine areas

4767512 valeri had a really bad injury but it looks as though he has come through that
4767513 i think everyone enjoys the way he plays he plays with a smile on his face and when he scores there is always a great celebration
4767514 we are delighted he is back it is like having a new signing as hes had hardly any football here
4767515 valeri is looking strong and has the potential to be a match winner this year we are looking to bring him on and give him more game time
4767516 if we start winning games early the confidence in what we say and tell the players will rise as a consequence
4767517 the spotlight at blackburn was not as great as here and anything or any issue will be highlighted 10 fold
4767518 its nice to be doing playing well again the ryder cup would be lovely and i would be an idiot if i said it doesnt matter but more important is enjoying my golf again
4767519 ive had my reasons to feel a bit down but considering how ive played the last few months ive a lot to smile about this week
4767520 this is exactly what i had in mind trying to challenge the lead i am as good if not better than a lot of them i think
4767521 my coach and i have always known i have the ability to do it i just needed the opportunity and i got it at the open and took it
4767522 equiano has been in really good form and weve got to know him
4767523 obviously hes new to us but hes run well on soft ground in france and won on fast ground so i dont think the ground is an issue
4767524 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer
4767525 you can make these up to one week in advance
4767526 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
4767527 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life

4767531 wie man bei uns in bayern sagt das training war f r die katz ich stehe nun morgen in der vierten startreihe auf dem 13 platz bin aber nicht unzufrieden mit einem guten start ist einiges drin und um diesen zu trainieren bin ich kurz vor ende des qualifyings noch mal raus der start war dann auch okay wie schon gesagt ich gehe zuversichtlich ins rennen
4767532 der 13 platz ist schade denn es ist knapp an der dritten reihe vorbei aber mit den guten starts die stefan immer macht d rfte es kein gro es problem sein trotzdem vorne mitzufahren
4767533 wir hatten gestern und heute ein paar kleine technische probleme das sollte zwar nicht kann aber immer mal passieren
4767534 wir haben von aprilia neue teile bekommen und den neuen motor eingesetzt ich denke dass sich das positiv auswirkt es ist schon immer schwierig wenn man an einem rennwochenende neue teile bekommt und sie sofort einsetzen muss ohne sie vorher testen zu k nnen
4767535 we all knew we needed this game and we get down 4 0
4767536 we got a little fire in our belly and the coaches got after us after the first couple innings because we werent having good at bats
4767537 from that point on we really had some solid at bats and we were able to string some things together
4767538 ich konnte sehen dass brendon probleme hatte und wusste dass ich die pace hatte wenn ich nur vorbeikommen w rde
4767539 er hat dann in copse einen fehler gemacht woraufhin ich mich neben ihn setzte und ihn berholen konnte
4767540 es ist einfach gro artig nochmals zu gewonnen denn das hat die meisterschaft noch enger gemacht

4767543 one of the first times that i saw her when she was awake in the icu she was asking me why i wasnt coaching the team
4767544 thats a testament to the support and the importance she places on what were doing here we talked about it fairly extensively
4767545 a lot of hugs and then we just got on and got through the scouting report on china and watched video we tried to keep it as business like and as routine as possible
4767546 last night he was there at the village we had a video meeting talked about the game plan and to be honest i thought it may be a little stranger but it kind of felt like we didnt skip a beat
4767547 i wouldve been quite happy to get on the plane with them but we had some unfinished business here
4767548 she was extremely encouraging she was adamant that i stay she assured me shes going to be good weve had a week here to grieve together and ive been trying to do my best to help her through this very difficult process but shes a strong woman and shes in a good place right now to be with her family and to get on with the next phase of this thing
4767549 i actually went over to the new zealand part of the village last night just to say thanks
4767550 its a little bit humbling but also very reassuring to know that your mates are your mates
4767551 i told the guys through our team leader that if they needed me for anything volleyball related they should call me

4767554 in recent years the trend in ya fiction has been toward a proliferation of darker edgier fare aimed at a more mature audience
4767555 what we dont know from the essay is how easily kids are allowed to dodge the librarians best intentions entirely and simply go to the ya or adult books by themselves that would have been my own strategy as a sixth grader particularly if i had had a previous encounter with a librarian that made me feel snooped upon or deflected
4767556 bella and edward are no longer in high school theyre dealing with grown up family problems not teen problems when young readers were reading about people they could relate to in the earlier books they were willing to ignore the way so many characters roll their eyes chuckle and snore the improbabilities regarding plot and the scenes that went on way too long but bella becomes matronly in breaking dawn and edward seems as if he ought to be out playing golf

4767560 otra de las labores que estamos llevando a cabo que es crear una p gina web del centro en la que intentaremos que toda la gente pueda tener a su servicio las im genes

4767567 but why do all the stories about africa involve animals and doom and gloom
4767568 this is the first time in the 21st century another country has invaded a sovereign nation
4767569 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
4767570 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
4767571 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
4767572 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
4767573 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
4767574 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation
4767575 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law

4767579 strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to and availability of programs for pre and postnatal health care parenting skills income support and caring adoption programs
4767580 what this does most importantly is to commit the democratic party to supply real support for the child for the woman facing this question
4767581 we pursue the art of the possible and if we move to protect even a single life weve done a good thing

4767584 and the bible also tells us that god created the whole universe
4767585 our joyful optimism lies in the conviction that there is no place devoid of god hell that is to say the place where god is not can only be created as a result of an estrangement between our world and god if we hold on to the earth and the fullness thereof psalm 91 1 then everything even death and destruction is a ferment of divine life the air itself no matter how polluted is vibrant with the spirit beyond the shattered image there always lies the reflection of the divine reality that has no end and the re presentation of the vision of god that knows no darkness this faith alone can transform evil and pain while disclosing a loving purpose beyond suffering and isolation

4767589 no sir the flight isnt going to leave until later tonight we need to bus you all to the landing zone after dinner
4767590 well can you just let us out at the gate well find our own way back
4767591 o k how many of you sunni leaders want to get left in the middle of baghdad to find youre way to ramadi instead of flying with an armed escort
4767592 oh well all go and rent a couple of cars
4767593 its nice to be doing playing well again the ryder cup would be lovely and i would be an idiot if i said it doesnt matter but more important is enjoying my golf again
4767594 ive had my reasons to feel a bit down but considering how ive played the last few months ive a lot to smile about this week
4767595 this is exactly what i had in mind trying to challenge the lead i am as good if not better than a lot of them i think
4767596 my coach and i have always known i have the ability to do it i just needed the opportunity and i got it at the open and took it
4767597 valeri had a really bad injury but it looks as though he has come through that
4767598 i think everyone enjoys the way he plays he plays with a smile on his face and when he scores there is always a great celebration
4767599 we are delighted he is back it is like having a new signing as hes had hardly any football here
4767600 valeri is looking strong and has the potential to be a match winner this year we are looking to bring him on and give him more game time
4767601 if we start winning games early the confidence in what we say and tell the players will rise as a consequence
4767602 the spotlight at blackburn was not as great as here and anything or any issue will be highlighted 10 fold
4767603 equiano has been in really good form and weve got to know him
4767604 obviously hes new to us but hes run well on soft ground in france and won on fast ground so i dont think the ground is an issue
4767605 john was substituted in friday nights win over shamrock rovers with an injury to his right ankle
4767606 an x ray last night confirmed that there is no fracture and further examination this morning suggests that he has suffered soft tissue damage to the ankle
4767607 john will continue to receive treatment over the weekend and as the swelling continues to reduce a clearer picture of the extent of the injury will emerge
4767608 the injury will be assessed again on monday when it is hoped that a decision can be made with regard to johns recovery programme
4767609 it was a traumatic week for the club the manager and the players but at the end of the day we are paid to play football and thats what we did
4767610 hopefully we can get a home draw and a big gate and get things moving in the right direction again
4767611 this is the first time in the 21st century another country has invaded a sovereign nation
4767612 when the program started here in 2004 we were training polands senior pilots and squadron commanders these days were training their junior pilots
4767613 weve graduated about 34 polish pilots so far and we anticipate that there will be more to come
4767614 it was my goal to train in the u s
4767615 ive been here for two years i started at language school at lackland air force base in texas then i went to t 38 training at columbus air force base in mississippi my final phase is here
4767616 in the beginning it was good to fly often so i could practice sometimes long breaks are not good when you are learning something difficult and repetition is very important
4767617 take offs and landings i can do but all the other stuff in the f 16 is very difficult
4767618 the airplanes fly by wire system and computer keeps us from exceeding the limitations of the fighter
4767619 before i had to be more careful not to exceed the limitations
4767620 we teach them that when you make a flight plan thats a good starting point thats where were going to deviate from we teach them to adapt and they like it they like to have the ability to take off and make decisions
4767621 at home i would spend two or three days planning sorties and then go fly several in a day
4767622 i knew exactly what i was going to do in those sorties but here it changes everyday just when you think youve learned something you will also be introduced to something new at the same time
4767623 our instructors are like mothers who love you and are eager to correct you when you do something wrong but they do it because they care about you and they want to help you
4767624 they know what they are doing and i see that they have a lot of experience and a lot of patience
4767625 weve been sending our members to a base in poznan for the last two years as mobile training teams
4767626 the teams consist of three pilots and they spend three months at a time assisting polish f 16 pilots keeping them current on their training
4767627 its a great county the people are nice and the food is great as a former soviet republic they have really adopted capitalism they have joined the west from a free market standpoint and they are good allies for our country
4767628 seeing them succeed gives me a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction
4767629 we will continue to build our alliance with them and its a great feeling knowing that the work we do here in tucson is translating into a safer environment in other parts of the world

4767689 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4767690 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4767691 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4767692 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4767693 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4767694 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4767695 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4767696 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4767697 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4767698 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4767699 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4767700 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4767701 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4767702 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4767703 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4767704 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4767705 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4767706 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4767707 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4767708 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4767709 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4767710 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4767711 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4767712 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4767713 ive got a theory about the motivations well i dont know that i could i dont know that i can put this one on the air
4767714 we know weve been told that elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards thats part of the puff pieces on them that weve seen ergo if elizabeth edwards is smarter than john edwards is it likely that she thinks she knows better than he does what his speeches ought to contain and what kind of things he ought to be doing strategy wise in the campaign if she is smarter than he is could it have been her decision to keep going with the campaign in other words could it be that she doesnt shut up now thats as far as im going to go
4767715 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk
4767716 my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
4767717 he knows how important this tour is to me and he knows my weaknesses and is using them against me instead of supporting me
4767718 i love your feet because they walked upon the earth and upon the wind and upon the waters until they found me

4767739 the ak430 needs to have its flail tips replaced around every 200 hours depending on the material you shred it costs something like 40 70 to replace one unit with 36 units thats 2 520 to replace the lot

4767769 focuses on crimes and takes it to the next step and translates it into the court system
4767770 and this addresses it intelligently its good for the community good for children and has a secondary effect of decreasing the jail population
4767771 do we need a bigger jail the trends that im seeing seem to indicate that
4767772 even with our daily innovation it is also a good possibility that we will need a bigger jail in 2 3 years in summary we should continue our current efforts to address the issues of expansion and innovation but should be prepared to fund an expansion of the courthouse and jail should the need arise much sooner than we currently predict

4767780 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4767781 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4767782 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4767796 i would urge people to take advantage of this opportunity to have their say in the future of retailing in the isle of man

4767837 the holy grail is to combine the home phone with the wireless phone
4767838 were trying to bring some of the functionality of the wireless phone back to the home phone
4767839 we feel that folks should not be using the wireless phone when theyre in the home they should be using a reliable landline phone

4767846 and it was a very important and serious thing that involved national interests and an order from a state leader from the politburo
4767847 it was about presenting the nations music and cultural image especially because it was as the national flag entered the birds nest
4767848 the girl shown on television had to have the most perfect voice and be perfect looking it was fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi
4767849 i have an obligation to make this explanation to the chinese audience
4767850 clever child with indeed a beautiful voice and painting and singing talents
4767851 she is a good child kind hearted cute friendly and low profile with a very calm heart she loves performing peking opera and has participated in shows on international volunteers day
4767852 its harmful to both girls and it is discomforting to know that a girl was instructed to mime while the other had no chance to show her face due to an allegedly unattractive appearance
4767853 why do we have to compromise honesty for these so called national interests
4767854 we received two orders in a row yesterday morning urging us to delete the article immediately and not to allow any publicity on this issue

4767859 the page was removed by china com cn however there was a baidu cached page no mention of crooked teeth and chubby fat face
4767860 either the view or the country dont match the affiliation of the reporter then that country has had it at least in the hysterical english language press that standard bearer of self righteous morality and sole arbiter of universal taste

4767862 mr chen disclosed in interviews that producers had pulled peiyi a seven year old beijing girl with a
4767863 we didnt expect miaoke to become so popular overnight and it would be a big embarrassment if miaoke was shaped into a singing star but later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4767864 this is a smarter way of letting the public know something that it will know sooner or later but i dont think this thing was a big thing to start with
4767865 embarrassed that their beautiful dream of the patriotic song had burst
4767866 there were a number of candidates to sing the song and the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
4767867 you have to make sure the performance and the song are at the highest level it is a casting or a technical decision by the producer
4767868 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4767869 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing that hes going to stay on the bench
4767870 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great thats what it is in sport and in life
4767871 we were very pleased with its outcome of one of the most complicated events to organise in the world
4767872 later it was discovered that she had no musical talent
4767873 they made us sign and chop a document saying we would not allow black people in during the olympics
4767874 but no one is willing to say so because well all get deported and have our business shut
4767875 we simply cant let them in during the olympics its what i was told
4767876 its the restrictions on blacks definitely happening it will all happen in 24 hours
4767877 they local police call meetings and everyone has to go or else if you dont go theyll come back and shut you down
4767878 black guys can come in and drink as long as they have valid visas
4767879 but we have been told to watch out for black guys acting suspiciously such as constantly talking on their mobile phones the aim is to crack down on drug dealing
4767880 if this is policy then it is a very bad policy more so for a country holding an olympics
4767881 uniformed public security bureau officers came into the bar recently and told me not to serve black people or mongolians
4767882 i understand that the government is trying to stop certain illegal activities but i dont think blanket discrimination is going about it the right way
4767883 chinese people are prejudiced but i would have hoped that the government would set a better example as it debuts on the world stage
4767884 the officials told me to inform my customers that they must at all times carry their passports or id cards
4767885 security is important but beijing is becoming a fortress and thats not attractive
4767886 the local police told us to get rid of the tables because theyre scared that if too many foreigners congregate outside there could be trouble
4767887 the whole music scene is angry and bewildered it is impossible to understand how keeping tourists from seeing an open culturally vibrant and diverse beijing is possibly a good thing for anyone
4767888 it appears the local government is trying to control every aspect of the experience that foreigners get when they come here
4767889 everything is aimed at creating stability but they dont understand that is precisely the unfounded prejudice that foreigners have of chinese society that it is a highly controlled and not a very cultural place it seems completely self defeating

4767905 ryan has been bothered by this condition in his foot for some time
4767906 he consulted with a number of specialists in an effort to correct the problem without surgery but it was ultimately determined that surgery was the best path to take for his general well being and for his career
4767907 obviously he will miss the start of the 2008 09 season but the doctors tell us he will be able to play pain free when he returns to the lineup this season
4767908 ryan got a lot of ice time for us so this will create an opportunity for another player or players to step up and fill the void until he returns

4767912 lieutenant schrier unhesitatingly exposed himself to the onrushing enemy and by his personal example and shouted encouragement rallied his small force and led it to a counter attack which destroyed forth six of the enemy and caused the survivors to withdraw in disorder

4767967 it is a third party saying you are not entitled to these records and jeff did nothing to participate in that that was a fight between the state and a third party and he should not be held accountable for that
4767968 it seems improbable to me that the amount of runoff from the type of application that occurred could cause a fish kill of the magnitude that the governments talking about
4767969 the pollution of this nature normally moves as a slug once it passes its gone
4767970 its kind of hard to say that statelines manure application caused the problem because there was no real evidence of that
4767971 i know what a fish kill looks like and what causes it and how it acts and this one doesnt look like it came from a simple manure application because of the volume that could come off a field there doesnt appear to be enough manure to do that

4767977 we have to be careful in each word we write
4767978 if we write something that isnt in favour of the militants resistance groups the military or the government then we are in a dangerous situation
4767979 for being iraqis we are in a more delicate situation because we dont have anywhere to hide or anyone to support
4767980 sometimes we have to hide behind foreigners to be protected
4767981 nothing is being done to protect journalists covering the iraq situation
4767982 it is becoming intolerable especially when you see that the proposed democracy is just for politicians but not for other professionals or ordinary iraqis
4767983 in addition to being easy targets to survive we have to accept working as journalists but having our names hidden while foreigners take all the credit by using our stories under their by line
4767984 they dont offer any protection and even if we are killed our families dont have the right of insurance as they have
4767985 my son was killed for speaking with a journalist about us elections
4767986 they made him two questions and it was enough reason for them to kill him he wasnt aware of the new law imposed in our district and was a victim of the daily violence in iraq where democracy is just an illusion
4767987 a true patriot is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins
4767988 weve gone through one stimulus bill already and it was about 150 billion it was not my first preference my first preference was to put money into building infrastructure roads and bridges because every billion dollars that you spend 47 000 jobs are created
4767989 now the question is if well come up with another economic stimulus package at the end of the day with a new president the main thing that will help the economy would be to move to balance the budget
4767990 so weve got some upside down economic policies in washington that the next president is going to have to change from the current administration and that will start to revive the economy
4767991 the main driver of economic problems in florida is the housing market we passed a mortgage foreclosure bill to give additional assistance to people who wanted to stay in their homes and not be foreclosed and be able to do it
4767992 well i think drilling offshore is part of the solution but what the oil companies dont tell you is they have 32 million acres under lease at the gulf of mexico that they havent drilled they ought to go on and drill all that
4767993 whenever somebody says drill here drill now off of florida its going to the lower the price of gas that is just flat wrong
4767994 ive been saying this for a year florida will be the key and right now florida is even steven which ever one wins florida i think will win the presidency
4767995 hes starting to listen 21 2 weeks ago he gave a major space speech right outside kennedy space center in titusville hes doing now what it takes to win florida
4767996 they said i couldnt take lake county i think we got 58 percent of the vote in lake county i think they look at me as me not as a d or an r democrat or republican and i think increasingly people in this presidential race are going to do the same i mean the country is in desperate need of a strong visionary leader and i think people are going to look less at party and look for who is needed to lead this nation in a very perilous time
4767997 i think its boiled down to delaware sen joe biden indiana sen evan bayh and virginia gov tim kaine i think all three are exceptionally qualified the one im closest to is joe biden
4767998 the housing bust is fully upon us and the job losses associated with this housing bust continue to accrue and are showing up in these unemployment figures

4768002 whereas iran has proved time and again its good intention to help iraqs stabilisation development and prosperity through close cooperation with the iraqi government in different fields as well as to help iraqi people overcome their immense difficulties the u s government unwarrantedly insists on its unacceptable behaviour in scape goating others including iran for its own wrong policies in iraq
4768003 the continuation of the presence of foreign forces in the country and certain wring policies and practices on the part of foreign forces there

4768045 i always had clients that moved up from california or arizona asking where do we shop when i would travel back home they would say shop for us that just put more fuel to the fire to really make it come true

4768048 and jenna had a wide variety of boutique type clothing that you generally cannot find in the tri cities there were dresses there were tops there were designer jeans they were arranged in such a way it was easy to find what you wanted
4768049 i just started doing hair when i was little designing hair being artistic loving art and creativity that all plays together its evolved over time you kind of create your own style
4768050 i think the more stores and more shopping thats brought to town is going to benefit each other because people arent going to travel to go out of town to shop

4768069 our competition advanced micro devices threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the intel gm45 chipset did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4768070 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4768071 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4768072 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4768073 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4768074 suffered from stuttering every 15 seconds or so at 24 hz display refresh rate on blu ray and the issue is still there on g45 centrino 2

4768105 in the first month i noticed that my pants were fitting a little looser as the study progressed i had to keep tightening my belt and it felt great every time i did it
4768106 the best part of the diet by far is the fat i was able to use as much as i wanted and it always made my meals taste better
4768107 im feeling the best i have in a very long time a couple of years ago when i turned 40 i had a health scare heart issues and my doctor told me to lose weight and get some exercise but didnt really give me much direction other than that i joined the y had some initial success lost about 20 pounds but was constantly hungry and my exercise was primarily cardio i had no clue how to do anything with the weights so i just didnt then i got stuck for about 6 months no weight loss diet was boring i wasnt really following it and my weight was stuck at about 260 i had never tried low carb before as i had never thought i could give up my bread and fruit but i saw the info on the website for tnt and thought what the heck lets just try it and see if it works and it did im a convert and really am looking at this as a lifestyle change and not a diet

4768111 the continuing and illegal occupation of a european town violates not only human rights but also un security council resolution 550 and the high level agreements between the two communities in cyprus
4768112 the purpose of the nhs is to improve the health of the population so the most important measures of quality are measures of the outcomes of care the best assessment of that will usually be provided by the patient the simple notion that people can express the extent to which care leaves them feeling better or worse is the essence of measuring patient outcomes
4768113 data on patient outcomes is needed to provide vitally needed answers to four types of questions 1 nhs staff who deliver healthcare and commissioners need information on outcomes to help them benchmark and improve the effectiveness of what they do 2 patients need information on outcomes to be available to enable them should they so wish to compare different providers 3 commissioners need information on performance and productivity to decide how to get the greatest benefit from the resources at their disposal and how to allocate resources between different patient groups and types of care 4 the government needs to know how productive the nhs is how much health benefit the nhs is producing for the funds it receives currently productivity is measured in terms of the amount of activity in the nhs the numbers of patients seen and treated but there is no reference to how successful the activity is in improving patient health

4768121 de fotos zijn persoonlijke souvenirs van ons leven tijdens een tour omdat we zo vaak onderweg zijn vergeten we gemakkelijk wat er de voorgaande dagen allemaal gebeurd is
4768122 het is een uitzondering ik blijf mijn stijl met xxl shirts baggy jeans en petten trouw ook al vindt mijn kleine broertje het maar niks
4768123 elke dag heb ik wel nieuwe idee n ik typ ze uit op mijn mobieltje of laptop meestal schrijf ik liedjes wanneer ik heimwee heb
4768124 onze platenmaatschappij heeft ons geen deadline opgelegd en we willen ook niet te veel druk op onszelf leggen dat zou averechts werken onze fans hebben na een lange wachttijd heel wat geweldige liedjes wel verdient
4768125 we hebben al meer dan 1 000 uitgegeven om er precies zoals de tweeling uit te zien
4768126 we voelen ons nu ook een beetje als een ster

4768135 oscar said he wasnt budging it was take it or leave it manny opted to pass
4768136 i tried that as late as 15 20 minutes ago oscar will not fight him
4768137 there is still a chance for this fight to take place but we are not budging from our 60 40 stand
4768138 its not right to invite pacquiao to a despedida party by just giving him a bone from the banquet
4768139 still it would all depend on manny whether he will accept 70 30 its all up to him
4768140 negotiations are still ongoing manny pacquiao sent out a statement saying he will explore his options and see what comes out of this situation
4768141 face down is their most famous song the song is about how the band looks down to men that hurt their girlfriends or wife physically how they really respect women
4768142 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4768143 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4768144 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4768145 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4768146 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4768147 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4768148 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4768149 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4768150 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community

4768210 ci auguriamo non sia vero il sospetto che in italia stia rinascendo il fascismo sotto altre forme abbiamo definito indecente la proposta del ministro maroni sui bambini rom perch da un lato basta censirli aiutarli a integrarsi con la societ civile in cui vivono marginalizzati ma dallaltro bisogna evitargli la vergogna di vedersi marcati per tutta la vita come membri di un gruppo etnico considerato in potenza tutto esposto alla criminalit quella foto del bimbo ebreo nel ghetto di varsavia con le mani alzate davanti alle ss venuta alla memoria come un simbolo per questo il parlamento di strasburgo e il consiglio europeo hanno protestato

4768217 the financial proposal was so great that if the two clubs had agreed i would have left al ain were offering me a net sum of 2 5million million a year
4768218 untransferable is a term that makes me laugh because when saint etienne signed me from bordeaux i was also untransferable

4768234 j rgen klinsmann wie bewerten sie ihre premiere als trainer in der bundesliga
4768235 als trainer will man im ersten spiel nat rlich einen dreier einfahren das ist ganz klar wir waren auch auf einem guten weg haben den hsv durch den elfmeter zum 2 2 aber wieder zur ckgeholt wenn man alles addiert war es ein gerechtes ergebnis nach dieser zerfahrenen vorbereitung und mit den vielen verletzten muss man zufrieden sein auch wenn ich ein klein wenig entt uscht bin
4768236 sie haben in der coaching zone ber 90 minuten sehr viel engagement gezeigt haben ihr team immer wieder angefeuert ist der job als vereinstrainer stressiger als der des bundestrainers
4768237 es ist berhaupt nicht stressig sondern es macht irrsinnig spa wir trainer wollen es nicht anders wir wollen das adrenalin sp ren und am liebsten selbst mitspielen man ist auf strom
4768238 es hat zwei foulelfmeter gegeben wie bewerten sie die szenen
4768239 das muss man so nehmen wie es jetzt ist es ist vorgabe der liga an die schiedsrichter rigoroser zu werke zu gehen das hat thorsten kinh fer gemacht das ist vollkommen in ordnung
4768240 haben sie trotz des 2 2 fortschritte bei ihrer mannschaft gesehen
4768241 es gibt noch eine menge arbeit aber ich habe bei einzelnen spielern fortschritte gesehen die mannschaft sp rt langsam dass immer mehr frische und bewegung reinkommt wir kommen auch der feinabstimmung n her wir m ssen aber immer noch improvisieren wir brauchen noch einige zeit um den gew nschten spielfluss zu entwickeln und berall druck zu machen vor allem die nachz gler sind noch nicht auf dem leistungsstand um in der bundesliga 90 minuten zu gehen

4768258 regresar a la senda por la que se lleg a la etapa dorada
4768259 a favor de otras empresas m s amigas por decirlo suavemente
4768260 es uno de los equipos m s importantes del mundo
4768261 la batalla no est en demostrar que somos el primero de esta comunidad que lo somos sino en preparar un proyecto serio riguroso y ambicioso que nos fije como objetivo concreto la lucha por ganar cada una de las competiciones en las que participemos
4768262 este equipo ha sido grande cuando ha trabajado con humildad y sacrificio en el campo con inteligencia en los despachos y con rigor y control en las cuentas
4768263 fijaremos cada a o el coste m ximo de la plantilla pero no cerraremos las puertas a ning n gran futbolista que pueda sumar a nuestro proyecto deportivo los ingresos adem s no ser n homog neos para cada futbolista ni tampoco invariables depender n siempre de su rendimiento
4768264 hemos de perder el miedo a vender jugadores una buena gesti n de compra y venta de futbolistas es la clave del xito econ mico pero tambi n evita el estancamiento y los vaivenes deportivos el valencia debe comprar buenos jugadores en crecimiento a un precio razonable reforzar posiciones clave con jugadores de prestigio y a la vez saber vender cuando se crea conveniente
4768265 lorsque liphone sortira en europe nous aurons d j commercialis 3 ou 4 terminaux suppl mentaires
4768266 probablemente el jugador m s importante en la historia del club
4768267 por mi parte este asunto est olvidado y ahora mi deseo es recuperar a albelda
4768268 en ese sentido vamos a marcar la l nea de trabajo en la escuela para sin prisa pero sin pausa conseguir que haya m s jugadores que merezcan subir al primer equipo
4768269 en funci n de lo que beneficie al valencia y no a nosotros mismos
4768270 es complicado llegar a soluciones que a veces parecen l gicas y que hay que trabajar a partir de las posibilidades del valencia y de la calidad de los futbolistas
4768271 joaqu n igual que el resto de jugadores excepto villa y silva goza del mismo estado que el resto se estudiara cualquier opci n que llegue al club porque no hay jugadores intransferibles sin embargo el precio lo pone el valencia y el precio de estos jugadores es alto
4768272 creo que es una competici n atractiva pero no deja de ser mitad de agosto y uno de los primeros partidos de competici n en los que vamos a ver el nivel de los equipos pero los dos estamos en rodaje y falta ritmo de competici n
4768273 igual es pronto pero es mejor empezar la temporada jug ndote un t tulo este partido es un premio al buen trabajo del a o pasado en la copa del rey y as hay que tom rselo
4768274 es uno de los mejores equipos ahora mismo y en el vestuario se respira la ilusi n por conseguir un t tulo porque para los jugadores siempre es importante sumarlos a su palmar s
4768275 trat ndose de l es dif cil que se pueda desestabilizar y si est en el terreno de juego ser un jugador muy a tener en cuenta
4768276 para nosotros es importante que puedan jugar teniendo en cuenta la calidad de los jugadores tocados
4768277 a un gran activo como es el nuevo estadio de mestalla
4768278 ambos podr n ser afrontados con la venta de las parcelas de mestalla y con los proyectos comerciales que se est n negociando en la actualidad todo ello permitir que el resto de la deuda pueda ser refinanciada a largo plazo
4768279 puedo asegurar que en las pr ximas semanas cerraremos un acuerdo para la venta de todas las parcelas de mestalla que nos reportar unos ingresos superiores a los trescientos millones de euros por el momento tenemos tres ofertas que superan de salida esa cifra
4768280 en cualquiera de los dos casos s lo por este concepto hablar amos de una cifra de ingresos de 350 millones de euros
4768281 a partir de ese momento el valencia iniciar una etapa en la que los ingresos deber n proceder de los derechos televisivos del nuevo estadio y de los patrocinios
4768282 da absoluta y definitiva estabilidad econ mica a la entidad
4768283 en octubre concretaremos un acuerdo con los plazos de pago de cada una de las certificaciones de obra mientras que la ute se ha comprometido a recuperar los peque os retrasos y a mejorar el sistema de instalaci n de la pista de atletismo que la ciudad de valencia necesita para seguir optando a grandes eventos deportivos

4768304 i actually have been driving less because of the gas prices
4768305 there are more people out there who are biking cycling taking mass transit walking so its a strong reminder for everyone to review the rules of the road
4768306 in life certainly there are some tragedies that cant be prevented a traffic crash is simply not one of them a traffic crash is preventable predictable and were asking for help to keep maryland roads safe
4768307 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4768308 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4768309 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4768310 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4768311 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4768312 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4768313 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4768314 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4768315 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4768316 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4768317 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4768318 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4768319 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4768320 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4768321 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4768322 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4768323 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4768324 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4768325 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4768326 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4768327 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4768328 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4768329 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4768330 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4768337 obviously hes new to us but hes run well on soft ground in france and won on fast ground so i dont think the ground is an issue
4768338 valeri had a really bad injury but it looks as though he has come through that
4768339 i think everyone enjoys the way he plays he plays with a smile on his face and when he scores there is always a great celebration
4768340 we are delighted he is back it is like having a new signing as hes had hardly any football here
4768341 valeri is looking strong and has the potential to be a match winner this year we are looking to bring him on and give him more game time
4768342 if we start winning games early the confidence in what we say and tell the players will rise as a consequence
4768343 the spotlight at blackburn was not as great as here and anything or any issue will be highlighted 10 fold
4768344 john was substituted in friday nights win over shamrock rovers with an injury to his right ankle
4768345 an x ray last night confirmed that there is no fracture and further examination this morning suggests that he has suffered soft tissue damage to the ankle
4768346 john will continue to receive treatment over the weekend and as the swelling continues to reduce a clearer picture of the extent of the injury will emerge
4768347 the injury will be assessed again on monday when it is hoped that a decision can be made with regard to johns recovery programme
4768348 it was a traumatic week for the club the manager and the players but at the end of the day we are paid to play football and thats what we did
4768349 hopefully we can get a home draw and a big gate and get things moving in the right direction again
4768350 its nice to be doing playing well again the ryder cup would be lovely and i would be an idiot if i said it doesnt matter but more important is enjoying my golf again
4768351 ive had my reasons to feel a bit down but considering how ive played the last few months ive a lot to smile about this week
4768352 this is exactly what i had in mind trying to challenge the lead i am as good if not better than a lot of them i think

4768365 the sense of history is important but the first goal i set for myself is the gold
4768366 i was wondering if people would still respect me if i lost my mother told me i had to mature from 2005 she siad i shouldnt worry and believe in myself
4768367 i am pretty upset i guess it will probably set in later on i could have been a little better

4768373 being away from memories of ron will do her good
4768374 hes always been friendly but as youd expect he has what i call a healthy scepticism about me i think any father would if their daughter got married the way we did
4768375 im terrified of meeting him face to face but thats going to happen soon its all been arranged

4768379 when i picked up the award i had to walk past him so i went to say hi and suddenly he had me pinned against the wall i just went white and had to get away
4768380 i just had to leave the building through the back door it was horrible i went home with a heavy heart and an award

4768411 wondered if you fancied going out for dinner at the weekend
4768412 people think that imposing these draconian retroactive laws are a way to keep their children safe
4768413 these laws dont provide public safety they only demonize a particular group
4768414 informing the public of a true fact is not considered punishment
4768415 weve objected since it was first introduced in the legislature
4768416 we believe its unconstitutional when its applied retroactively even going forward its bad policy
4768417 we used to have a system where a judge made a decision about an offenders risk to re offend
4768418 now its based only on the offense that theyre convicted of not on any future risk
4768419 remember its the offender who decided to go out and commit the crime that they did
4768420 this increases the standards and raises the level of accountability of those individuals who have been convicted of sex crimes and it raises the ability of law enforcement to further protect the community
4768421 i never touched my stepdaughter or any other child inappropriately

4768424 this year we havent seen the pilgrims holding pictures of clerics or shouting against the government like last year
4768425 we come every year last year my son was wounded by a bullet during the pilgrimage but i insisted on coming again anyway this year the situation is more secure and organized
4768426 the future of these cells and their resistance action depends on the american decision either to implement a withdrawal timetable or to establish long term bases
4768427 when i arrived in the operations room i saw a book of idf safety instructions that shouldnt have been there
4768428 there were idf cds that explicitly said confidential documenting army activities charts from special units operations and officers names
4768429 the training companies wanted to finish the projects as quickly as possible in order to create more projects and make more money
4768430 we knew the training had to be completed quickly because the soldiers would soon have to get into real military activity
4768431 by israeli standards the soldiers had almost zero capability and the officers were mediocre
4768432 it was clear that taking that army to war was illogical
4768433 some of them became good friends of mine and invited me into their homes its hard to digest that these people have suddenly vanished from the face of the earth
4768434 ive said you know somewhat coldly i dont care whose lives are touched by this story and whose lives are changed or what good comes of it the heart of a mom is that i want maria back and thats what i want people know i want maria back
4768435 but because i know that she is completely whole because of my faith i know that shes completely whole and completely okay and im going to see her again as a mom i have to shift that grief to go to emily whos getting married and her fianc tanner and caleb and his girlfriend julia and will franklin hes my baby boy and then shaoey and stevey and my grief gets shifted to making sure theyre as whole and healthy as they can be
4768436 ive gotten a stronger faith through all this but then theres sic those days that just hit you and youre like oh man this is just awful you have just got to continue to choose to live and thats the faith that continues to keep me going
4768437 weve talked a lot and you will hear all of us talk about the process of grieving with hope
4768438 f or us thats what has kept us breathing kept us alive that while we are grieving this process there is a hope that we have that were anchored to in the midst of just what sometimes seems unbearable
4768439 the laws are on the books but unless there is some way to enforce them you dont have that mechanism
4768440 unfortunately there are entities that take federal money ranging from hospitals to medical schools to clinics that maybe arent even aware that these laws exist and thats where the hhs regulations come in
4768441 without protections in place it not only affects the healthcare provider but it can negatively affect the patients as well
4768442 the icc taskforce needs to report back to the icc they need to take on the advice that theyre picking up not only from feedback theyre getting from australia but also from new zealand and england and south africa and other parts of the world
4768443 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
4768444 approximately half of women in the united states will face an unintended pregnancy during their lifetime and about half of those who unintentionally become pregnant resolve the pregnancy through abortion
4768445 it is believed the bill will ensure that a womans consent provides lawful authority for an abortion up to 24 weeks gestation after that terminations would be unlawful unless doctors deemed continuing the pregnancy would pose a risk of harm to the woman
4768446 i saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments seeing these things it changes you
4768447 i didnt find out about a lot of it until after he passed
4768448 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4768449 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4768450 we do a poll we dont ask is this right or wrong we ask what do people think and they do think this is a concern
4768451 ive home schooled as well and ive found myself having to explain to people on more than one occasion that we find socialization in many places other than a school system so i think people have to recognize that it is a concern of the culture
4768452 were not seeing the thousands the hundreds who streamed through in the past
4768453 i dont see the justification to spend 60 million on an area thats no longer an important crossing
4768454 what makes some church leaders and i guess average christians a little suspicious about this is for lack of a better term the self censorship that rick warren is practicing here
4768455 for example hes not going to ask either of the candidates anything about abortion even though its one of the primary distinctions between the two candidates
4768456 its well known my long record of advocacy for the rights of the unborn and i will be glad to stand on my record for the family values and the traditions not only of the catholic church but all americans
4768457 we were unanimous that the forum should have been allowed to proceed
4768458 those who had united to oppose the forum had no understanding of the issue at hand
4768459 in view of the sensitive reactions and wrong perception among a section of the malay muslim community
4768460 we cant achieve any sense of mutual agreement unless we are willing to talk and openly to one another about the issues that matter
4768461 to act against mob rule and to allow citizens more democratic space for open dialogue
4768462 the protestors should have come out with their proposals in addressing the issue of non muslim husbands who abandon their spouses and their families and convert into islam rather than stop a legitimate forum
4768463 my goal in becoming a lawyer has never been to take on unjust laws
4768464 it is to be able to work with people and demonstrate integrity and excellence thats how i am going to change the world by the way i conduct myself
4768465 i gathered it was not the truth so i called him on it
4768466 i told him i want to know the truth whether it hurts me or helps me
4768467 it was really strange to have an attorney hold me to the truth
4768468 any civil attorney can find a million frivolous things to file on but its almost stealing
4768469 why file it if its not going to advance my clients case its a big temptation to raise billable hours
4768470 pretty much with every case i feel i can help somebody
4768471 people dont come to an attorney unless they need help
4768472 i rarely mention that i am a christian unless someone asks i had one client who said to me i know you are a christian i said oh how is that he said i just knew there was something about you the way you treat me and talk to me that was an amazing compliment and i give the credit to the lord for using me that way i really want my actions to speak loudly to people
4768473 were preaching and teaching the gospel and praying and healing the sick
4768474 jesus said a tree is known by its fruit whats the fruit weve produced thousands are coming to praise god
4768475 todd is rather special to us weve really experienced gods presence at his meetings
4768476 im 20 years older i know lots more about the bible than he does yet theres something about him hes got something i havent got
4768477 we do our best to find out the situation in one case a boy drowned in a pool he had no pulse wasnt breathing and was clinically brain dead
4768478 we hear about the dead being raised but we dont know who they are or where they are
4768479 i saw a lot of passion from bentley but there was too much hype i just dont feel i can endorse something thats being exaggerated
4768480 eheh si vede se perdi tempo a commentarmi una cosa su cui secondo me hai pure torto vi spiego cos per me
4768481 e tu cosa ne sai tu cosa ne puoi sapere di ci che provo dentro di me
4768482 qualcuno ti ha detto che lo devi leggere per forza io questo voglio sapere se non vi interessa
4768483 there is a long list of charges against him we will file them by the latest by tuesday
4768484 i think he will have to take this decision today or tomorrow if he resigns then there will be no need for the impeachment process
4768485 she sometimes calls me 50 times a day and asks me things that light my life up but like all daughters she is very manipulative and cunning so she gets what she wants a lot
4768486 kevin has a wonderful heart he wants them to raise these kids together kevins heart is right
4768487 weve grown a lot ive been able to come back into my daughters life and that was an adjustment anyway because im an alcoholic and its the first time weve really been able to share
4768488 ni se re ne ni est ni se le espera
4768489 la cifra de inversi n m s baja de toda la historia de comunidad
4768490 claramente insuficientes y de escaso impacto en la econom a canaria
4768491 nos sobra un gobierno que despilfarra que malgasta el dinero en publicidad protocolo propaganda y en televisi n radio p blica y polic a auton mica y nos hace falta un gobierno que se ocupe de combatir el paro mejorar los servicios p blicos aliviar la econom a de las familias y dinamizar la inversi n p blica
4768492 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4768493 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4768494 i was in high school when she hit it big
4768495 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at
4768496 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s
4768497 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4768498 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4768499 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4768500 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4768501 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4768502 film which appealed to older women because of its portrayal of the late 40s and 50s as a still sexy time of life
4768503 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4768504 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4768505 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4768506 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4768507 i have once again become a medium of violence in the world
4768508 inflicted by an evil demon that is nurtured by our so called criminal justice system
4768509 i dont know what god wants for me i just dont know
4768510 help they kidnapped me they wont let me go home or nothing
4768511 the legislature and the governor changed our marriage laws to please the well connected minority and force a social experiment into other states thats very offensive to a majority of the people at least the way the votes have been going
4768512 the fact that this happened the way it happened just adds to the sense of sleaziness and underhandedness of the whole process
4768513 ive learned that when it comes to equality for gay and lesbian people the struggle is never over because there are certain people that are just strongly opposed to any rights for gay people its never shocking it is disappointing
4768514 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4768515 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4768516 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4768517 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4768518 down in the hole but half way up and shooting
4768519 heres arthas the lich king a death knight and a squirrel here and im about to love him
4768520 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4768521 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4768522 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4768523 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4768524 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4768525 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4768526 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4768527 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4768528 i am telling you with all responsibility that this could not have happened
4768529 when we were involved in combat actions as part of the peacekeeping operation bridges were our targets indeed but now when there is peace why should we blow up bridges it is us who would have to restore them we are working hard there
4768530 our units are on the outskirts of gori now where large arsenals of georgian weapons including 15 tanks have been discovered
4768531 wenn sie etwas suchen das wirklich sehr gut hilft dann gibt es da nat rlich noch etwas anderes
4768532 vor allem junge frauen die wegen cellulite in die hautarztpraxen kommen sind oft sehr verzweifelt sie wollen die dellen auf ges und oberschenkeln einfach nur loswerden und f hlen sich hilflos weil cellulite etwas ist das man sehr schwer beeinflussen kann
4768533 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4768534 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4768535 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4768536 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

4768556 you have to lose to know how much you really want to win
4768557 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4768558 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

4768561 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4768562 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying

4768570 mr lot can brad pitt and paul newman come out to play please

4768572 i dont really like kids i threw that prick ishmael out too and his pain in the ass mother
4768573 he doesnt get flustered and come unglued when something bad happens normally in a game something bad is going to happen
4768574 he has shown tremendous poise youre a rookie you come in here from college and youre playing tackle and youre moving to center and then youre right guard and then youre left guard youre going up against this defense and the multiplicity that they have were audibling were changing plays
4768575 there would be disappointment if he didnt do as well
4768576 we scouted him well some guys are robotic he just gets it dont send him to the hall of fame yet but for right now the arrow is pointing in the right direction
4768577 i know thats one of the things that separates people in the nfl how they are from the neck up im just trying to focus on that aspect a lot because everybody is physically talented so thats whats going to separate you from the next man

4768582 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4768583 there are no secrets to success it is the result of preparation hard work and learning from failure
4768584 you go out there not quite knowing what could happen
4768585 you have to try to have faith in your own abilities in what youve achieved in the past
4768586 but it was far easier for me you can run the 1500m without having the perfect preparation you know that youll at least be in touch until the final 200m or so
4768587 its not the same in the marathon theres a big difference between being fit enough to start and being fit enough to win a medal
4768588 paula will have a problem with her strategy all athletes want to run the way theyre used to the way they like
4768589 if shed run 2hrs 21 mins in london in april shed have a plan of what she could do but that didnt happen
4768590 the athletes who beat mara at the worlds last year yamauchi finished ninth are here and theyve run faster than her
4768591 but she was the top british female last year and she wants to improve against the rest
4768592 i have never heard of what youre talking about i will put my hand on a bible
4768593 of course by all accounts the divorce was completely amicable after john and carol mccains divorce there was apparently some confusion about belongings that were roberta mccains but we understand the court papers were unintentionally filed and the matter never went further in the legal system it went nowhere and was of no consequence
4768594 had no knowledge of the suit he did not authorize the suit or participate in its filing
4768595 you can be sure that i talked to and got the permission of any client who is listed as a plaintiff
4768596 i dont think it took more than 15 minutes of his time
4768597 the fact that they dont remember it doesnt bother me
4768598 plaintiffs lawyers will routinely ask for significant damages to try and prompt a settlement
4768599 what possible difference could it make it was all 25 years ago
4768600 i wish him well but i dont talk to reporters
4768601 i do it because i like free stuff and wont get caught id do the same with anything if i knew id get away with it
4768602 what the prefix designer does is to raise the status of the product concerned it transforms the product almost into a piece of art
4768603 im appalled that in a matter of days parts of the fence have been removed
4768604 the fence was put up there to ensure the safety of our pupils
4768605 it was put up there for a reason to stop people from using the school field as a public area to walk their dogs and use mini motos and quad bikes particularly whilst the field is being used by the children
4768606 we had to clean the field of dog mess daily and on one occasion it was used for dumping an old burnt out car
4768607 people were using the school playing field to walk their dogs and riding mini motos when the children were using the field putting the health and safety of children at risk that is why the fence was put up
4768608 it is no good the school doing all it can to protect children when some mindless vandals then undo the good work
4768609 and not only that vandalise the building causing thousands of pounds worth of damage

4768618 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4768619 giunto il momento in cui il tuo sentiero diventi strada
4768620 weve had about 12 come out and ive talked to about 40 of them
4768621 i see them off and on at the hotel and there will be more coming out
4768622 president ioc jacques rogge is coming out on the 20th and several others have told me they will be coming out
4768623 softball will be working for the next 13 months to gain the attention of the ioc that softball has the opportunity to regain its position in the olympic programme
4768624 there are problem areas we identified them and were going to work hard to solve them and move ahead
4768625 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4768626 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4768627 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4768628 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4768629 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4768630 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4768631 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4768632 who are open to doing something on the production side
4768633 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4768634 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4768635 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

4768641 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4768642 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4768643 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4768644 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4768645 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4768646 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4768647 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4768648 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4768649 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4768650 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4768651 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4768652 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4768653 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4768654 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4768655 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4768656 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4768657 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4768658 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4768659 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4768660 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4768661 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4768662 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4768663 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4768664 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4768665 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4768666 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4768667 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4768668 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4768669 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4768670 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4768671 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4768672 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4768673 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4768674 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4768675 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4768676 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4768677 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4768678 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4768679 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4768680 it is unexceptionable that some women will come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained severe depression and loss of esteem can follow
4768681 some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained
4768682 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and with stansted or with luton or manchester
4768683 it competes with charles de gaulle in paris it competes with dubai now and with schipol in amsterdam because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of these airports actually has nothing to do with the competition
4768684 i think there is a mood in the country that just wants the business broken up
4768685 we will fully support the break up frankly it is about time monopolies do not help consumers ever it was almost as if baa had won the lottery without doing anything they have been in a position where essentially they could control how we travel
4768686 it may make sense because airlines know how to deliver to consumers
4768687 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

4768697 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4768698 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4768699 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives

4768701 the idea that we could adapt to a 4 c rise in a few centuries is absurd and dangerous
4768702 so thats just going to have to remain a mystery for all those dylanologists
4768703 my reflex action was to say thank you very much but no it had been so many years that id shut the door but the way he presented it was what was it like as a young girl to come from the family i came from and end up in the village and be in this place and observe it through my own eyes that was something to think about then my son said people have been writing a version of you for years its time you told the real one it suddenly made sense
4768704 when he started out as a performer he was playful a combination of woody guthrie and harpo marx with a good dose of himself as a binding ingredient
4768705 he used that playfulness to draw the audience in with the passing of time the technique was no longer required the audience was with him the minute he stepped on stage a sense of humour however was always his strong suit
4768706 right from the start i couldnt take my eyes off her
4768707 she was the most erotic thing id ever seen she was fair skinned and golden haired full blood italian we started talking and my head started to spin she was just my type
4768708 situations have ended sad relationships have all been bad mineve been like verlaines and rimbaud
4768709 i felt i was reading a book of revelations lessons warnings
4768710 even though picasso was a much older man than bob and had experienced a lot more their personalities were so similar that it was astounding
4768711 he sat still and quiet didnt even jiggle his leg
4768712 people ask was this song written for you well i could say this and that i could make a list but if you really listen to those songs theyre somewhat like fiction hes written something coming from his life but he sets it in a fiction maybe using another characters voice
4768713 i can recognise things its like looking at a diary it brings it all back and whats hard is that you remember being unsure of how life was going to go his mine anybodys so from the perspective of an older person looking back you enjoy them but also think of them as the pain of youth the loneliness and the struggle that youth is or may be
4768714 i could see that he was an artist at work
4768715 i was a young girl of my time i was shy and timid and i would be envious of men who could go to a cafe and sit and draw and read or write songs or do whatever they could do if a girl did that it would mean that she was alone she wasnt with somebody she was an easy woman it would take a lot of courage to do it and when you did it you took a chance
4768716 he had this intensity about him and you got sucked in
4768717 i certainly felt that as his girlfriend i disappeared and became a nonentity even if he didnt see me that way thats what happened that was always a struggle
4768718 there are people who say that he was not a good guy he was manipulative he was this that and the other i tend to see it as you are what you are he could be a shit like anybody else but a lot of it had to do with being given permission to say and do whatever you wanted because nobody was in a position to tell you no everybodys yessing you and everybody wants a piece of you so what do you do
4768719 and there are no residual hurt feelings i think shes an example of a woman who really knew what she wanted and how to get it and to everybody else the hell with you which men could do easily she went out and got what she wanted and then he in turn did it for her and then he didnt that was him going after what he wanted with no baggage he never looked back he just kept going
4768720 it was the hardest thing to write about i was young and vulnerable and insecure there were pressures from all around and i couldnt find my place any more i didnt feel i had anybody i could turn to that makes you really fall apart and thats how i felt
4768721 only four people in new york know what that means he makes guitars
4768722 but its true so it doesnt go from page to page but the emotion that i managed to find is true
4768723 oh you can download a program to do all that

4768794 i do know hes been knighted though which is amazing
4768795 hes always been friendly but as youd expect he has what i call a healthy scepticism about me i think any father would if their daughter got married the way we did

4768851 yes i figured that youd not be the type to play poker with right top
4768852 general one of the ears told me that under dog speed tops out at about an encrypted 150 top dog broke the bank at 225 so savant or not i wouldnt code anything around them that you didnt want them to hear
4768853 true top true so tell us under dog how does a prideful fellow like yourself allow top dog to beat you a mere wisp of a girl
4768854 general sir that wisp of a girl is my betrothed and she eidetic so i doubt that 225 measure id suggest that there is no one on the planet better than her to fall to such and adversary is no shame and remember whod boss of this outfit see its not how well you can do it it whether or not you can convince people to follow your lead now thats a skill besides it suited our purpose to have your team recognize her and think she was the boss one should after all never lose sight of the objective and certainly not allow anything as trivial as pride trip you up besides one cant do everything you need people to help right
4768855 top be real careful with this one he has all the makings of a politician youre right of course
4768856 yes instead of lolly gagging around how about you apply yourself to the security problem of these trucks
4768857 well why are all of the inside men looking at the trucks if i was one of these children it would make me nervous and frankly some of these children have a lean and hungry look wouldnt you agree top
4768858 yes sir id go into a dark alley with them at my side and after seeing what that girl could do with two sticks i dont think they are afraid of much reminded me of a zulu boy going out to become a man by killing a full grown lion with a short spear rumor hath it that there are some bad guys back in the city worse for wear and tear after running into these children
4768859 yup tops right sheriff do you think our men could do an about face the threat is going to come from the outside in

4768873 general other than me all these women and children learned how to drive after we were rescued by these children for the first part we practiced on imaginary trucks and if i was not part of it i would not have believed it as a matter of fact i saw it and im not sure i believe it
4768874 we had another bread truck called 2 with more tools and stuff but that was left when the driver brian as killed

4769083 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4769084 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4769085 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4769086 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4769087 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4769088 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4769089 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4769090 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4769091 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4769092 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4769093 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4769094 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4769095 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4769096 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4769097 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4769098 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4769099 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4769100 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4769101 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4769102 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4769103 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4769104 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing

4769111 violence including sexual violence remains an everyday threat for women and girls
4769112 most of women and girls were raped by family members and friends
4769113 the question is why does thai society still ignore violence against women the ignorance about violence against women in society is a kind of violence itself
4769114 we have to eliminate this attitude from our society and help each other to improve
4769115 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the way the citizens see it here
4769116 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
4769117 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
4769118 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
4769119 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
4769120 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately going to help this situation

4769135 i am here every day reading and it is a comfort to know i am not alone
4769136 caught between barack and a hard place was written with the hope of addressing that issue and encouraging everyone to raise their voices thank you for raising yours and please continue to do so
4769137 when youre screwing up and nobodys saying anything to you anymore that means theyve given up on you
4769138 i havent seen an ad yet where he talks about what hes gonna do and the reason is because those folks know they dont have any good answers they know theyve had their turn over the last eight years and made a mess of things they know that youre not real happy with them
4769139 and so the only way they figure theyre going to win this election is if they make you scared of me
4769140 well we know were not very good but you cant risk electing obama you know hes new hes doesnt look like the other presidents on the currency you know hes got a hes got a funny name
4769141 john mccain and the republicans they dont have any new ideas thats why theyre spending all their time talking about me
4769142 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4769143 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
4769144 there is nothing more to this than the fact that he was describing that he was new to the political scene he was referring to the fact that he didnt come into the race with the history of others it is not about race
4769145 vice presidential candidate sen john edwards was caught visiting his mistress and secret love child at 2 40 this morning in a los angeles hotel by the national enquirer
4769146 anyway most peoples poor financial situations are based on their mental and emotional issues i fail to see how that really be solved with such legislation
4769147 great article jc hope your followers understand is not a cry of arrogance but a true call for people to contribute in helping america to have conscience about the process and try to escape it
4769148 hey did everybody check your tire inflation today i have 10 times but my gas tank is still on 1 4 tank
4769149 get the car tuned up and the tires properly inflated so we can solve the energy problem lol
4769150 and dont get me wrong im all for a free society and the open exchange of information but when said exchange becomes indoctrination for political philosophical or monetary gain without regard to consequences we have a real problem on our hands
4769151 as barack obama has said many many times in the past
4769152 im going to do everything in my power to protect my candidate and to define the race in terms that i think are appropriate
4769153 im going to let the american public decide what is negative and what is not negative
4769154 but im going to do everything in my power to protect my candidate and to define the race in terms that i think are appropriate
4769155 the obama campaign does a wonderful job of presenting their candidate in the most popular light that they can get and they do a very good job at it
4769156 sen obama is an impressive speaker and the beauty of his words have attracted many people especially among the young to his campaign
4769157 i applaud his success all americans should be proud of his accomplishments my concern with sen obama is with issues big and small what he says and what he does are often two different things
4769158 the campaign is making him seem angrier than he is and therefore its a disservice to him
4769159 this careening from message to message makes them look like they dont have one specific thing they want to say about this guy and that there is no centralized theme there is no centralized message
4769160 as barack obama has said many many times in the past

4769162 americans want to vote for him but something is holding us back
4769163 the obama campaign has decided to unleash over 3 600 street organizers on registering voters and they are staffing all 50 states to have their people monitor and lure independent and republican voters to their side
4769164 wow it must be nice to quit your job and go around politicking
4769165 today yesterday in the opinion journal former kgb intelligence officer ion mihai pacepa explained the propaganda tactics of the communists during the cold war here is a bit of what pacepa had to say about the soviets propaganda campaign in the west
4769166 during the vietnam war we spread vitriolic stories around the world pretending that americas presidents sent genghis khan style barbarian soldiers to vietnam who raped at random taped electrical wires to human genitals cut off limbs blew up bodies and razed entire villages those werent facts they were our tales but some seven million americans ended up being convinced their own president not communism was the enemy as yuri andropov who conceived this dezinformatsiya war against the u s used to tell me people are more willing to believe smut than holiness
4769167 does that remind you of anyone here are the words of future democratic senator john f kerry in front of the senate foreign relations committee on april 22 1971
4769168 they told the stories at times they had personally raped cut off ears cut off heads taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power cut off limbs blown up bodies randomly shot at civilians razed villages in fashion reminiscent of genghis khan shot cattle and dogs for fun poisoned food stocks and generally ravaged the countryside of south vietnam
4769169 what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
4769170 you know he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4769171 as yuri andropov who conceived this dezinformatsiya war against the u s used to tell me people are more willing to believe smut than holiness
4769172 so what if he has a high opinion of himself
4769173 i dont think sen mccain is running a racist campaign
4769174 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4769175 there is nothing on the record to indicate obama ever withdrew his support from odinga
4769176 even after odinga signed the agreement with the muslims in kenya
4769177 appears even today to be a direct and active supporter of odinga as odinga himself frequently boasts
4769178 for their own separate reasons odinga and sheik abdullah abdi joined forces
4769179 sheik abdullah abdi agreed to swing islamic voters to odinga in kenya and odinga agreed to support islam should he become president
4769180 by endorsing raila odinga during his 2006 visit to kenya obama positioned himself to be seen by kenyans as an important u s senator who was joining forces with his luo tribal kinsman this positioning further sided obama with raila odinga as he ran against president mwai kibaki in the december 2007 presidential election in kenya
4769181 i hope the next ad shows mccain inflating his tires and walking to the gas pump waiting for the price to come down turn to the camera and say it doesnt work
4769182 david the only nasty turn ive seen is barack obamas fluent misuse of the race card throughout his campaign hes been subtle with it at times however it is unmistakable to anyone whos paying attention senator obama needs to realize that this election is not about racial identity it never has been and intelligent voters do not appreciate having such a non issue thrown into the mix a candidate for president has no gender no race no age so lets cut with the bs the subtle and not so subtle games lets see some joint townhall meetings where voters can see both candidates perform without benefit of scripts or teleprompters and fyi the obama campaigns constant disingenuous attempts to paint mccain as a gw bush clone are tedious and tiresome a reconsideration may be in order because if anyone has striking similarities to gw bush that person would be barack obama not john mccain your welcome

4769198 shoot for the moon even if you miss you ll land among the stars
4769199 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions
4769200 i can tell you this theyre not a monolithic bloc as the press frequently tries to make them out to be i think that for many evangelicals theyre not convinced that either of these men is an evangelical they may be believers in christ they may be christian but they want to know for instance their world view and they want to hear it out
4769201 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others

4769207 this is the first full tour ive done in five years and im excited to get out and play for people
4769208 being out with good friends like chris and kevin should make for really fun shows
4769209 ive always wanted to do something that was quieter and acoustic and could be played by one person
4769210 i wanted to go out and play shows alone i just want to have my little folk moment

4769212 were not the only ngo nongovernment organization to have suffered an attack unfortunately we suffered the most egregious and most tragic of these attacks
4769213 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable
4769214 there are very real ethical and operational concerns that arise from the confusion between humanitarian and political and military objectives

4769222 the reform in changing the moral climate in low income communities its beginning to rebuild the work ethic which is much more important
4769223 but i do want to know how they handle a crisis because a lot of the things in the presidency often deal with things you dont know are going to happen that we dont know will happen in the next four years there are a lot of different things you can deal with in the life of a leader that will tell us more about the candidate than some of the typical questions

4769225 im unashamed and unembarrassed about my deep faith in god but i do not obviously try to impose my views on others
4769226 im doing things ive never done before im trying more things maybe its because i feel like i dont have that much time left to do everything that i want to
4769227 i have to stay young to keep up with them
4769228 if im going to live that long i want to be in the best shape i possibly can be

4769239 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4769240 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4769241 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4769242 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4769243 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4769244 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4769252 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4769253 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4769254 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender

4769274 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
4769275 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
4769276 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
4769277 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
4769278 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

4769281 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones

4769283 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4769284 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4769285 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos

4769287 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4769288 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos

4769299 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos

4769311 nessun alibi se abbiamo perso qualcosa abbiamo sbagliato e una grande delusione ma sono pronto a restare
4769312 non so dire se sia un risultato giusto ma certamente un risultato che fa male ci credevo ci credevamo tutti quando perdi cos una delusione grande ma bisogna uscire a testa alta
4769313 mancata molta brillantezza sia in attacco che in difesa non so perch ma non mi va di cercare scuse se abbiamo perso qualcosa abbiamo sbagliato
4769314 il progetto per me continua anche se lultima cosa alla quale penso in questo momento il bilancio tutto sommato lo ritengo positivo ma quando ti trovi a disputare una gara o dentro o fuori vedi il traguardo vicino e questa una cosa crudele

4769324 i studied the film and i was always amazed on a lot of plays it was really me
4769325 it wasnt the offensive line not getting a block or anything like that or anything they were doing really it was really me kind of hurting myself
4769326 i was able to take a lot from those tapes
4769327 just being more patient and learning to play up the gut more
4769328 i dont judge you for having those thighs i judge you for having those thighs and wearing those shorts
4769329 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4769330 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4769331 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4769332 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4769333 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4769334 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4769335 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4769336 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4769337 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4769338 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4769339 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4769340 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4769341 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4769342 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4769343 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4769344 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4769345 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4769346 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4769347 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4769348 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4769349 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4769350 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4769351 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4769352 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4769353 this is pc whatever my name is we have marty here with us
4769354 oh my god what is it what has he done hes supposed to be at work until eight in the morning is he all right
4769355 well hes been a bit of a silly lad and caused some damage it seems hes had an argument with a girl that hes had a bit of a shine on and when shes knocked him back hes driven his bike into a car
4769356 yes yes hes fine hes not hurt and luckily he hasnt done a huge amount of criminal damage were a bit worried about his mental state but weve got cameras on him and hes fast asleep now
4769357 no hes been breathalysed and there was no alcohol in his blood
4769358 well thank god for that what are you saying to me that hes tried to commit suicide over some stupid girl i dont understand
4769359 well we dont know the facts yet well let him sleep tonight and interview him in the morning when hes feeling a bit better about things
4769360 no dont come down hes fast sleep and you wont be allowed to see him theres absolutely no point in coming down tonight well give him some breakfast in the morning and call you when were ready to interview him
4769361 well mam it was like this see i had my moped up on its stand i revved it a bit too much and when i kicked it off the stand the back wheel was going round too fast and it just shunted into the car accidentally
4769362 so you went down the road a bit and it happened again then
4769363 ive been working on a new algorithm that will make it easier to determine the likelihood that future vintages of particular wines will be better than previous vintages

4769369 she has been bullied at school since christmas shes all right when shes away from school on holiday but when she goes back its obvious shes not happy
4769370 i want people to know that shes missing and i want her to come home ive been going out of my mind weve been everywhere weve tried her mobile but theres no answer

4769375 i heard a good number of protestants refusing to see the film because
4769376 lets go kill god and holy crap are those angels gay
4769377 i threw the damn thing out and ended up getting her the little house series
4769378 actually i had heard that all three of the books were already filmed and could be released at any time
4769379 i saw a trailer for the first movie online which included scenes that were obviously from the second movie
4769380 its quite possible that what you saw was unused footage from part one in the trailer not scenes from part two
4769381 just why mr frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than the price
4769382 leeleeone given that there are seven books in the chronicles of narnia

4769390 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4769391 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4769392 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4769393 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4769394 we may have gyroscopic trains as broad as houses swinging at 200 miles an hour up steep grades and around dizzying curves

4769435 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race

4769482 its actually a win win for everyone it benefits the consumers it benefits the utility because thats less power that they actually need to generate for customers to use and it benefits the environment because that is less greenhouse gas emissions or other types of harmful emissions going into our atmosphere

4769500 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4769501 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

4769517 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four innocent victims who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable

4769562 there was quite a bit of media attention especially in europe about these young children comparing them to kids that used to work in the coal mines in the 18th and 19th century
4769563 in many ways it was a knee jerk reaction from the gymnastics federation to remind coaches to not push so hard

4769576 it is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of mozarts work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence in a paradoxical way daemon more steadily in all of mozarts supreme expressions of suffering and terror there is something shockingly voluptuous

4769616 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4769617 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4769618 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state

4769630 but when you look at barcelona they have gone out and signed some really good players real madrid look good and inter milan will be strong under jose mourinho
4769631 they have great experienced players who are obviously not happy with us winning the league two years in a row
4769632 they have signed some new players as well and got a new manager so they will make it tough for us while i think arsenal who do not appear to have replaced mathieu flamini or alexander hleb although any side boasting arsene wenger as manager has to be respected arsenal go on given the players they have lost
4769633 any other team would struggle given the players they seem to lose on a regular basis but somehow they seem to stay up there
4769634 this could be a tough season for them but somehow arsene wenger always seems to do the business with his players
4769635 the beauty of playing for a club like this is that the players want to improve
4769636 you see paul scholes and ryan giggs leading the way doing extra in the weights room and our training games are sometimes a better standard than premier league games
4769637 you soon find out a draw is a bad result at this club in fact there have even been times when we have won and said afterwards our performance probably was not good enough
4769638 but that pressure to perform also means if we play to our potential we will pretty much beat everyone
4769639 that is what we need to focus on because if we achieve that on a regular basis we have a very good chance of being champions again
4769640 i was in a gang alcohol drugs you name it i was around it or involved with it
4769641 what good are the trials i went through if i dont use my experiences to educate at least my children

4769643 thats why we wholesale to give the patient the best service and fair price

4769645 georgina spent four months in the neo natal unit at st michaels hospital part of the childrens hospital and received excellent care both as an inpatient and an outpatient in the years afterwards
4769646 raising money through the bike ride is one way in which we can show our appreciation for everything that the hospital staff did for her
4769647 some observers had also contended that gen kayani was too much
4769648 im appalled that in a matter of days parts of the fence have been removed
4769649 the fence was put up there to ensure the safety of our pupils
4769650 it was put up there for a reason to stop people from using the school field as a public area to walk their dogs and use mini motos and quad bikes particularly whilst the field is being used by the children
4769651 we had to clean the field of dog mess daily and on one occasion it was used for dumping an old burnt out car
4769652 people were using the school playing field to walk their dogs and riding mini motos when the children were using the field putting the health and safety of children at risk that is why the fence was put up
4769653 it is no good the school doing all it can to protect children when some mindless vandals then undo the good work
4769654 and not only that vandalise the building causing thousands of pounds worth of damage
4769655 dasha has upset the pecking order by pushing her way into hefs heart the competition for his attention is really intense among the girls because of her
4769656 i arrived at k8 the first week in january 1953 and was assigned to the 90th par a dice bomb squadron as it would be a while before i would start flying missions as a b 26 gunner i was delegated along with others to while away my time loading bombs after doing this for approximately three months on the sometimes frozen tarmac of k8 we developed a tremendous respect for the airmen who did this full time the armorers and the aircraft maintenance people were the true unsung heroes of the bombardment group
4769657 for some reason beyond my comprehension hard liquor was available only to the officers and not to the enlisted men
4769658 i recall the base chapel or one of them as being not much larger than a wide trolley car with benches for maybe three or four on each side and of course the altar at the far end my friends roger and george myself and others would attend services when our schedules allowed late afternoon song and prayer sessions were popular with those flying night missions when the chaplain asked for volunteers to accompany a truck load of goods destined for one of the local orphanges in kunsan we jumped at the opportunity as we were not allowed off the base otherwise i really dont recall much of the trip to kunsan except when we arrived at our destination it was what appeared to be a school for orphaned children when we stopped the truck we were immediately surrounded by scores of children mostly boys probably between the ages of six and twelve they seemed so happy to see us and some of them even sang a song for us it was as if they were trying to cheer us up this is what remains with me more than anything else about my tour of duty in korea maybe because i still have a photo of those kids charging our truck i probably didnt realize it at the time but looking back after all these years this is really what it was all about these kids and thousands more like them and those to come a shot at freedom
4769659 the missions the fifty missions i flew just seem to blend into one big ten week mission one big blur from the two hour milk runs to the dreaded six hour bdas and everything in between
4769660 i flew my fiftieth and final mission on the night of june 25th 1953
4769661 i was on my way home when i received word that george was missing in action 1 july 1953
4769662 constant shortage of trained crews parts and supplies crews finished their tour of duty in short duration and were rotated home making it necessary to constantly trian and retrain
4769663 sgt chet leroy an engineer with the 90th bs flew b 26s on nocturnal raids during this period when the toughest job north of the 38th parallel it appeared was driving a north korean truck with b 26s and marine f4us and f7fs prowling the highways in the darkness the enemys movements of vehicle convoys was anything but easy leroy remembers a b 26 mission with unintended consequences
4769664 it was standard procedure to turn off the navigation lights when passing over oboe when en route to the target area oboe was the name of an island checkpoint just off hte coast of korea this particular night i was the right seat engineer after a few low level passes on various targets my pilot and i agreed that flak was heavier and closer than usual fortunately it was not close enough to do any damage to our aircraft
4769665 when we made a head on strafing pass on a truck before we fired our guns the trucks headlights started going in an erratic pattern and one light went out we pulled up off the run somewhat puzzled since we hadnt gotten any flak in this area we started another dividng pass on the truck but this time we extended the landing lights the truck was part of the way down a steep embankment wrecked we spent the rest of the nights mission inadvertently decreasing their rice output which is one way of saying that some of our bombs exploded in the rice paddies instead of damaging trucks
4769666 later when we passed oboe outbound i reached up to the center overhead panel to turn on the navigation lights only to discover that we had never turned them off when headed into the target area this explained the better than normal flak accuracy and the incident with the truck the driver had seen our lights as we dived in on him and he just bailed out of the truck and it went off the road and down the embankment so we destroyed a truck without firing a shot
4769667 dont remember much about the water except we never knew when it was turned on cold showers were available whenever it was turned on word spread like wildfire thru the area when it was turned on and you stood in line with 50 or more guys waiting to get wet commodes only flushed when water was available smell got a little heavy when the water was off for a few days
4769668 we had a 100 gal lister bag set up in the maint shack for drinking water got pretty stale between fillings at least it was wet ice cold in winter and hot in summer the only hot water was at the mess tent where you dunked our mess kits and silverware to clean them clean clothes yea right
4769669 what makes some church leaders and i guess average christians a little suspicious about this is for lack of a better term the self censorship that rick warren is practicing here
4769670 for example hes not going to ask either of the candidates anything about abortion even though its one of the primary distinctions between the two candidates
4769671 its well known my long record of advocacy for the rights of the unborn and i will be glad to stand on my record for the family values and the traditions not only of the catholic church but all americans

4769676 we are not only deeply saddened but also outraged at this unprovoked and wanton slaughter of four who were committed to providing humanitarian assistance to the afghan people on an impartial basis of only meeting the needs of the vulnerable

4769689 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4769690 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4769815 in many ways it was a knee jerk reaction from the gymnastics federation to remind coaches to not push so hard
4769816 but im not sure thats really worked im not sure if in the gym that causes a coach to back off a little maybe it does
4769817 the logic makes sense but im not sure it works

4769830 as well as larger international strategies and proposals to address the creation of sustainable world systems
4769831 rapid economic growth does not benefit everyone equally some people for a complex variety of reasons suffer severe psycho social dislocation traditional criminal justice responses usually exacerbate such situations
4769832 the combination of severe psychological uncertainly coupled with prolonged social displacement provokes a desperate response
4769833 but the barren pleasures of a crack junkie which amounts to membership in a stigmatized and deviant subculture featuring the transient relief from pain and nervous thrill of petty crime can be more sustaining than the unrelenting aimlessness of psycho social dislocation
4769834 when youre an addict who needs to find 500 a day to stave off withdrawal you have something urgent to do with your time you know who you are and of what your life consists
4769835 its the police who recognize this first because they see the same people in and out of the criminal justice system
4769836 harm reduction does this by concentrating on people as human beings first rather than as public irritants or criminals or community problems to be swept from one location to another harm reduction does not fall into a utopian of believing that social problems like addictions or a mental illness prostitution can be solved once and for all
4769837 the traditional system that we have in place for the clients that we care about here when they get into trouble thats when they get care they get picked up by the ambulance they get taken to the emergency department theyre cared for there and released back into the community when another crisis arises theyre picked up by an ambulance taken to the er and the cycle starts all over this can cost thousands of dollars something as simple as a seizure disorder can result in that sort of revolving door care its a lot more far sighted
4769838 to provide up front care rather than to wait for acute crisis acute emergencies that require hospitalization that costs tens of thousands of dollars
4769839 the primary goal of harm reduction is to reduce the health and social problems associated with the use and control of alcohol and other drugs in individuals their families and communities
4769840 i want to say one thing your assessment of the situation here is 100 per cent accurate i couldnt agree with you more
4769841 im not necessarily advocating that thats what i envision that we would try and achieve in our own city i know that there are other examples in the country of what a sobering station looks like but it was a very successful part of the continuum of care in portland i know that its only one portion of all of the things that we have to do as a community but i know that thats sort of on top of our list and the reason that were here at the forum

4769866 there were a couple of plays i wished i could have called back but as a whole i think i did a pretty good job of mixing it up and making sure i got everybody in the game
4769867 thats one of the toughest things making sure you keep all your receivers and your running back happy
4769868 there was also a point where i just said to myself ive got to get derick armstrong the ball ive got to get him a touch but the defence they were playing was pressing him and it was hard to get him that touch but not once did he ever complain
4769869 its a two way street when youre dealing with this i know some quarterbacks who say they just want to go out and execute the play thats called its one of those situations where its about how youre feeling that night
4769870 when you take on a little more ownership of the offence as kevin has done you see some of the things out there you need to see in order to be able to call the next play

4769872 his name is gerran walker he was on the steelers practice roster all of last year you could see him in regina in the next couple weeks he has tremendous speed and is a very good return guy
4769873 weve identified some players that we believe long term can be good players but when youre asking guys to come in mid season other than a special teams guy thats a lot to put on a guy to learn
4769874 they desperately needed a win and were well prepared and they dominated us early on were thrilled that were 6 1 but you can start to believe by divine right that youre supposed to win every game it was probably good for us to be punched in the nose wed prefer to be 7 0 but we found out we cant just put on the green helmet and jersey and go out and win
4769875 weve just finished the first third of the season and weve had a lot of things thrown at us but i have confidence in our team that well come back and win a lot of games in the second half i believe well play in november and our goal hasnt changed its a goal that many in this province thought was unthinkable and thats to win back to back grey cups

4769880 killers in aviation a complete study by world aviation experts on the fatigue factor involved in the korean air crash shows how critical decisions on pilot rest rules can be following that countries all over the world started reducing duty hours and increasing rest periods
4769881 airlines had to recruit 35 more pilots which meant added expenses
4769882 it is as good as saying that the earlier air accidents took place as the airlines concerned wanted their aircraft to crash
4769883 there are two networks at terminal 3 one a legacy network the other a shiny new one

4769893 you need to get your shit together and get something written
4769894 truer words have never been spoken listen man theres something i want to talk to you about i mean its the reason behind a lot of things for me it seems and i just need to tell someone about it
4769895 oh yeah finally going to admit to being a lazy slacker who cant put his mind to anything without first being pressured into it in some form or fashion oh i got it your some kind of masochist arent you you like a good beating to get you motivated to do something constructive
4769896 anyway sure but lets go talk this over a cup of coffee i havent had a caffeine infusion since about 9 oclock this morning and although that was only two hours ago im starting to feel it
4769897 it might be best to talk on the way to rehab for that addiction of yours my friend of course if this involves getting a turnover or something i suppose youll be fine for another day come on ill drive
4769898 man again i suppose this is the place to be though sad as it is
4769899 jesus man whats up with kristy and you are you ever going to do anything
4769900 i dont know i mean shes really cool and i like her but i dont know plus i mean she apparently has a boyfriend and i cant really just ask her out i mean i cant step between two people like that
4769901 why not it happens all the time what you need to do is just keep talking to her even if you do make a fool of yourself after all every man makes a fool of themselves in front of the ladies at some point in time but what separates the real men from the rest is how they handle themselves afterwards they can either retreat and let it get the best of them or they can just let it bounce off and use it for comedic value continuing on like nothing happened
4769902 i suppose so things have slipped though and it seemed like she isnt too interested
4769903 and whos problem is that shes not going to come to you and these things just dont create themselves if she doesnt seem interested well its up to you to change that fact youve gotta keep trying man else nothing will ever happen dont get to be that bump on the log that everyone ignores but be that maverick that captures her eye unless your publicly rebuked youve got no reason to cave in and raise the white flag doing so is just being lazy and stupid especially using the boyfriend excuse thats just asinine
4769904 eh i cant really argue with that i just dont really know what to do i mean aside from just being myself well hmm i dont know i suppose i wont really figure anything out unless i actually try
4769905 just talk to her make smalltalk even if it is something that makes no sense whatsoever something will undoubtedly come up and before you know it youll be engulfed in conversation
4769906 yeah your right just letting it fall to the side is something id regret heres to trying to get things back on track
4769907 so what was it that you wanted to tell me
4769908 well you know i think thatll just have to wait because right now im going to take this time to talk to kristy while i have a good chance to
4769909 go for it man ill still be out here unless of course i feel the need for a refill in which case ill have to make sure your not screwing up
4769910 we look forward to continuing our collaborative relationship with isro and aai during this critical phase of gagan

4769919 baby cheryl wasnt okay though not by a long shot she was in a coma the minute they brought her in she looked so peaceful even with the nasty cut over her left eye it looked like a younger version of sleeping beauty the pediatrician told me that there was very little that they could do that shed either pull out on her own or shed shed die for the next week it felt like i lived in that hospital i never left cheryls side ive never been religious but i prayed i prayed for a week solid i never stopped her life signs began to fade at about noon on the 22 nd they did everything they could to save her including brain surgery but it wasnt enough she slipped through our fingers i watched that ghostly green line on the heart monitor for more than an hour as she faded the beats kept getting softer and softer until she was gone
4769920 after cheryl died we had a funeral for both her and jennifer
4769921 i remember the day i met jennifer it was in the summer between my sophomore and junior years of college
4769922 jennifer was beautiful i dont think it hit me how beautiful she truly was until the night she died she was bleeding and covered with mud and soaking wet and i still thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world
4769923 i didnt really feel jennifers death until after the funeral
4769924 hello i hope that you are well whoever you are im sorry that you had to listen all of this but i hoped it help you see where i was coming from ive done something irreversible and i just wanted to tell you why before i go and lay down i want to go home
4769925 i miss them they say that you can get past these things but i cant i miss my family i miss everything i dont know why they had to die i dont know why my life had to be taken away from me i cant help what happened
4769926 i hope that you never have to go through what i did i hope that there is no more death i hope that whatever god is out there feels that my death will pay for it all it wont happen but i can dream i want to say something heroic i want to make you feel like youll miss me but i cant im just another senseless death i dont want to ramble on may you find peace with this in your own way

4769937 they went out to the store for me after noticing i was low on groceries they will be back after a while and we knew that you would be up in the attic or quite some time did you find anything interesting
4769938 i found some old pictures of grandpa ones i havent seen before and a letter he wrote to you i brought them down see
4769939 this is from right before grandpa and i got married what a time that was
4769940 this letter is from when grandpa and i were going through a difficult time
4769941 i can only imagine the pain that i caused him that day im extremely lucky that he made it back safely and was able to forgive me i really did love him and it took me almost losing him for good to realize that
4769942 he was going to ask me to marry him the day we were going to say goodbye
4769943 no no dear its fine both grandpa and i had made mistakes at the time but those mistakes showed us that we really did care for each other it was sad but it was also one of the happiest times of my life because it was that letter that showed me your grandpa really did love and care for me when he came back i talked to him and explained and he understood he had made his own mistakes as well but i felt that none were comparable to mine it showed the both of us that we really did mean a lot to each other and that we were right to marry so he asked me and we got married just a few weeks later it was the happiest time of my life even though it was difficult to go through at times
4769944 sally when you get older and fall in love settle for nothing less than perfect a man that will stick by your side even when it is the most difficult of times someone who will support you and push you to be the best that you can be loves you for who you are

4769988 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4769989 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4769990 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4769991 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
